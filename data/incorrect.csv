6586,6586,29898646,Pure bone marrow aspirate injection for chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a case report,"There are limited treatment options for patients with a chronic refractory greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Orthobiologic interventions may stimulate tendon healing and improve pain and function in patients who fail the standard conservative treatment. Since the US FDA's new position statement regarding the centrifugation of bone marrow aspirate products as a potentially 'more than minimally manipulated' product, there is a growing concern about the most common bone marrow aspirate concentrate technique. In this case, a 57 year old female with a debilitating chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome was treated with a pure autologous bone marrow aspirate injection using a novel aspiration technique. The patient showed significant improvements in pain and function without recurrence at 1-year follow-up. This is the first case report to illustrate this novel technique for aspirating pure bone marrow that should comply with the new FDA regulations. ",0
4926,4926,24325418,Quality of reporting clinical trials published in five leading Sri Lankan medical journals,"To assess the quality of reporting of clinical trials published in five leading Sri Lankan medical journals. Six medical journals were hand searched for clinical trials published from 1982 to 2011. Eligible criteria were all randomized and non-randomized clinical trials conducted in humans. A checklist was developed based on CONSORT and TREND recommendations. Each study was independently evaluated by two reviewers. Outcome measures were presence of checklist items in published reports. Fifteen randomized and 24 non-randomized parallel group trials from 724 studies in five journals met the inclusion criteria. Out of 39 trials, 39 (97%) clearly described the objectives, 16 (41%) defined the periods of recruitment, 7 (18%) reported how sample size was determined, 10 (25.6%) reported the methods to enhance the quality of measurements, 20 (51%) reported baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of each group, 4 (10%) showed flow diagrams, 23 (69%) reported statistical methods used to compare groups for primary outcomes, 21 (54%) reported effect size, 4 (10%) reported its precision, and 20 (51%) interpreted the results in the context of current evidence, and 5 (13%) described the generalizability of the findings. Of the 15 randomized trials, only one (7%) reported sequence generation, 5 (33%) allocation concealment, 9 (60%) reported blinding status of participants or investigators, and 2 (13%) reported intention to treat analysis. Reporting of several essential recommendations remained suboptimal. Education and training of trial methods and awareness of the CONSORT and TREND statements and more attention to the quality of reporting may improve matters. ",0
12516,12516,21913872,Genetic association studies in drug-induced liver injury,"A large number of case-control association studies on genetic susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury, involving both candidate gene and genome-wide association approaches, have now been reported. The strongest associations have been observed for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II genes and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). The associations with HLA class I and II genes are drug specific, though some apparently unrelated compounds show genetic associations with the same alleles. The underlying mechanism for the HLA association is likely to involve T-cell responses to either drug-protein adducts or to drug alone, but needs further investigation. The NAT2 association relates to liver injury induced by isoniazid, with most published studies finding an increased risk of injury in slow acetylators lacking NAT2 enzyme activity, presumably because of the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Other associations with genes relevant to drug disposition, innate immunity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function have also been reported, though these still need to be confirmed by replication in independent cohorts.",1
4108,4108,20512985,Multiple effects of silymarin on the hepatitis C virus lifecycle,"Silymarin, an extract from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and its purified flavonolignans have been recently shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we further characterized silymarin's antiviral actions. Silymarin had antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus cell culture (HCVcc) infection that included inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production. Silymarin did not block HCVcc binding to cells but inhibited the entry of several viral pseudoparticles (pp), and fusion of HCVpp with liposomes. Silymarin but not silibinin inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. Furthermore, silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b BK and four 1b RDRPs derived from HCV-infected patients. Moreover, silymarin did not inhibit HCV replication in five independent genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicon cell lines that did not produce infectious virus. Silymarin inhibited microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity, apolipoprotein B secretion, and infectious virion production into culture supernatants. Silymarin also blocked cell-to-cell spread of virus. CONCLUSION: Although inhibition of in vitro NS5B polymerase activity is demonstrable, the mechanisms of silymarin's antiviral action appear to include blocking of virus entry and transmission, possibly by targeting the host cell.",0
6805,6805,30970186,Randomized Trial of Verubecestat for Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease,"BACKGROUND: Prodromal Alzheimer's disease offers an opportunity to test the effect of drugs that modify the deposition of amyloid in the brain before the onset of dementia. Verubecestat is an orally administered ?-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitor that blocks production of amyloid-beta (A?). The drug did not prevent clinical progression in a trial involving patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had memory impairment and elevated brain amyloid levels but whose condition did not meet the case definition of dementia. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 104 in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating worse cognition and daily function). Secondary outcomes included other assessments of cognition and daily function. RESULTS: The trial was terminated for futility after 1454 patients had been enrolled; 485 had been assigned to receive verubecestat at a dose of 12 mg per day (the 12-mg group), 484 to receive verubecestat at a dose of 40 mg per day (the 40-mg group), and 485 to receive placebo. A total of 234 patients, 231 patients, and 239 patients per group, respectively, completed 104 weeks of the trial regimen. The estimated mean change from baseline to week 104 in the CDR-SB score was 1.65 in the 12-mg group, 2.02 in the 40-mg group, and 1.58 in the placebo group (P?=?0.67 for the comparison between the 12-mg group and the placebo group and P?=?0.01 for the comparison between the 40-mg group and the placebo group), suggesting a worse outcome in the higher-dose group than in the placebo group. The estimated rate of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease was 24.5, 25.5, and 19.3 events per 100 patient-years in the 12-mg group, the 40-mg group, and the placebo group, respectively (hazard ratio for 40 mg vs. placebo, 1.38; 97.51% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.79, not adjusted for multiple comparisons), favoring placebo. Adverse events were more common in the verubecestat groups than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Verubecestat did not improve clinical ratings of dementia among patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and some measures suggested that cognition and daily function were worse among patients who received verubecestat than among those who received placebo.

11099,11099,16887497,Effects of chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid on cholesterol absorption and metabolism in humans,"Quantitative and qualitative differences in intralumenal bile acids may affect cholesterol absorption and metabolism. To test this hypothesis, 2 cross-over outpatient studies were conducted in adults with apo-A IV 1/1 or apo-E 3/3 genotypes. Study 1 included 11 subjects 24 to 37 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or no bile acid for 20 days while being fed a controlled diet. Study 2 included 9 adults 25 to 38 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day deoxycholic acid (DCA) or no bile acid, following the same experimental design and procedures as study 1. CDCA had no effect on plasma lipid concentrations, whereas DCA decreased (P < 0.05) plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and tended to decrease (P = 0.15) low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. CDCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with CDCA and increased cholesterol concentration in micelles, whereas meal-stimulated bile acid concentrations were decreased. DCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with DCA and tended to increase intralumenal cholesterol solubilized in micelles (P = 0.06). No changes were found in cholesterol absorption, free cholesterol fractional synthetic rate (FSR), or 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase and LDL receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels after CDCA treatment. DCA supplementation tended to decrease cholesterol absorption and reciprocally increase FSR and HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor mRNA levels. Results of these 2 studies suggest that the solubilization of cholesterol in the intestinal micelles is not a rate-limiting step for its absorption.",1
6099,6099,28528569,Time to Treatment and Mortality during Mandated Emergency Care for Sepsis,"BACKGROUND: In 2013, New York began requiring hospitals to follow protocols for the early identification and treatment of sepsis. However, there is controversy about whether more rapid treatment of sepsis improves outcomes in patients. METHODS: We studied data from patients with sepsis and septic shock that were reported to the New York State Department of Health from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients had a sepsis protocol initiated within 6 hours after arrival in the emergency department and had all items in a 3-hour bundle of care for patients with sepsis (i.e., blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents, and lactate measurement) completed within 12 hours. Multilevel models were used to assess the associations between the time until completion of the 3-hour bundle and risk-adjusted mortality. We also examined the times to the administration of antibiotics and to the completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluid. RESULTS: Among 49,331 patients at 149 hospitals, 40,696 (82.5%) had the 3-hour bundle completed within 3 hours. The median time to completion of the 3-hour bundle was 1.30 hours (interquartile range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the administration of antibiotics was 0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), and the median time to completion of the fluid bolus was 2.56 hours (interquartile range, 1.33 to 4.20). Among patients who had the 3-hour bundle completed within 12 hours, a longer time to the completion of the bundle was associated with higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; P<0.001), as was a longer time to the administration of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06; P<0.001) but not a longer time to the completion of a bolus of intravenous fluids (odds ratio, 1.01 per hour; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02; P=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: More rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and rapid administration of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluids, were associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality.

2583,2583,12594313,Addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone,"BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone are closely related, highly malignant tumors of children, adolescents, and young adults. A new drug combination, ifosfamide and etoposide, was highly effective in patients with Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone who had a relapse after standard therapy. We designed a study to test whether the addition of these drugs to a standard regimen would improve the survival of patients with newly diagnosed disease. METHODS: Patients 30 years old or younger with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 49 weeks of standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin or experimental therapy with these four drugs alternating with courses of ifosfamide and etoposide. RESULTS: A total of 518 patients met the eligibility requirements. Of 120 patients with metastatic disease, 62 were randomly assigned to the standard-therapy group and 58 to the experimental-therapy group. There was no significant difference in five-year event-free survival between the treatment groups (P=0.81). Among the 398 patients with nonmetastatic disease, the mean (+/-SE) five-year event-free survival among the 198 patients in the experimental-therapy group was 69+/-3 percent, as compared with 54+/-4 percent among the 200 patients in the standard-therapy group (P=0.005). Overall survival was also significantly better among patients in the experimental-therapy group (72+/-3.4 percent vs. 61+/-3.6 percent in the standard-therapy group, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to a standard regimen does not affect the outcome for patients with metastatic disease, but it significantly improves the outcome for patients with nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone.",0
7552,7552,1974701,Brain tissue elasticity and CSF elastance,"In the analysis of the pressure-volume relationship of the intracranial system, the concept of brain elastance, sometimes called tissue elastance or CSF elastance, is often used. It is generally designated as Ecsf and is calculated as the slope of the pressure-volume curve of the system. Variations in Ecsf are related to, for example, changes in the buffering capacity of the system which, however, could be influenced by the cerebral vascular volume, compressibility of the meningeal membranes, and compressibility of the subpial brain tissue. Our interest is in isolating the effect of controlled changes in the intracranial system with changes in the subpial tissue only. Here we discuss the measurement of brain tissue elasticity and describe two experimental conditions in which simultaneous measurements showed distinct differences between the behaviour of the system CSF elastance and brain tissue elastic behaviour.",1
10725,10725,15511691,"Zonisamide: chemistry, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics","Zonisamide is a synthetic 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide with anticonvulsant properties. The sulfamoyl group on zonisamide was expected to suppress seizures in a manner similar to another sulfonamide analogue, acetazolamide, through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. However, this does not appear to be the primary mechanism of action since zonisamide requires much higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent titration in vivo. Studies with cultured neurons indicate that zonisamide blocks repetitive firing of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive T-type calcium currents without affecting L-type calcium currents. Its dual mechanism of action may explain its efficacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Zonisamide has a pharmacokinetic profile favorable for clinical use. It is rapidly and completely absorbed and has a long half-life (63-69h in healthy volunteers) which allows twice-daily, or even once-daily, dosing. Zonisamide is not highly bound to plasma proteins. Consequently, it does not affect protein binding of other highly protein-bound AEDs. Furthermore, zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism and does not induce liver enzymes. However, since zonisamide is metabolized by cytochrome P450, liver enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase zonisamide clearance, and dosage adjustments may be necessary when it is used in combination with certain AEDs.",1
2910,2910,15241437,BCR-ABL transcripts are early predictors for hematological relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia after hematopoietic cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning,"Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript elimination and its prognostic implications on relapse were analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after reduced intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In all, 19 CML patients were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation in combination with (n=14) or without (n=3) fludarabine 3 x 30 mg/m(2) (Flu) or 4.5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with Flu and OKT3 3 x 5 mg (n=2) and were treated with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil after allogeneic HCT. BCR-ABL transcripts were analyzed by nested RT-PCR and Taqman((R)) RT-PCR on days +28, +56 and +84 after HCT and were evaluated for their association with relapse. Of the 19 patients, 14 achieved sustained remissions of which six had a negative RT-PCR 28 days after HCT. Five patients relapsed +41, +54, +57, +136 and +234 days after HCT. Predictors for relapse were advanced disease stage (P=0.02) and slow reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts at day 28 (P=0.006) and day 56 (P=0.047) post-transplant. We conclude that a complete clearance of BCR-ABL transcripts is achievable within 4 weeks from HCT even after minimal conditioning and that early kinetics of BCR-ABL transcripts significantly correlate with the probability of hematological relapse.

9156,9156,8604150,"Comparative studies on the toxicity of mercury, cadmium, and copper toward the isolated perfused rat liver","""The toxic effects of cadmium, mercury, and copper were compared over the over range 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mM using the isolated perfused rat liver preparation. All metals caused similar changes in various parameters used to describe general toxicity. Thus reductions in oxygen consumption, perfusion flow, and biliary secretion were found, while lactate dehydrogenase release into the perfusate, as well as liver weight, increased also in a dose-dependent fashion. Each metal caused similar magnitudes of changes and exerted similar potency. Measurement of other parameters indicating more specific injury revealed a number of differences. Although all metals reduced hepatic ATP concentration, mercury and cadmium were more potent than copper in this respect. Cadmium was the most potent at decreasing reduced glutathione levels. Mercury was most effective at increasing tissue calcium content, while copper was less so, and cadmium ineffective. Only copper significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content, while all metals increased its release into perfusate. Furthermore, whereas cadmium seemed the most potent metal in increasing MDA release, it was least efficacious, while copper was the most. Antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and Trolox C only reduced cadmium's influence on MDA in perfusate; however, they did not affect cadmium's ability to alter most other parameters of vitality. Albumin reversed the toxic effects of copper and mercury, but not cadmium. While metal-induced reductions in perfusion flow accounted for some of the toxic effects of the metals investigated, the results as a whole supported the suggestion that all metals exerted toxicity at the mitochondria, since ATP levels were reduced in a manner that could not be reproduced by perfusion flow reduction alone. Lipid peroxidation appears to play little role in determining toxicity induced by any of these metals. Furthermore, albumin may play an important physiological role in preventing hepatic injury that might otherwise be induced through acute metal intoxication.""",1
5741,5741,25692915,"Aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema","BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown. METHODS: At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61�10 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year. RESULTS: From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab improved vision in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, but the relative effect depended on baseline visual acuity. When the initial visual-acuity loss was mild, there were no apparent differences, on average, among study groups. At worse levels of initial visual acuity, aflibercept was more effective at improving vision. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01627249.).",0
2844,2844,15215481,Long-term survival of children with end-stage renal disease,"BACKGROUND: Although renal-replacement therapy for children with end-stage renal disease has been used for several decades, data on patients' long-term survival are sparse. METHODS: We examined the long-term survival of all children and adolescents who were under 20 years of age when renal-replacement therapy commenced (study period, April 1963 through March 2002), using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Survival was analyzed with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods and age-standardized mortality rates. Risk factors for death were analyzed with the use of Cox regression analysis with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: A total of 1634 children and adolescents were followed for a median of 9.7 years. The long-term survival rate among children requiring renal-replacement therapy was 79 percent at 10 years and 66 percent at 20 years. Mortality rates were 30 times as high as for children without end-stage renal disease. Risk factors for death were a young age at the time renal-replacement therapy was initiated (especially for children under 1 year of age, among whom the risk was four times as high as for children 15 to 19 years of age) and treatment with dialysis (which was associated with a risk more than four times as high as for renal transplantation). Overall, a trend toward improved survival was observed over the four decades of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in long-term survival, mortality rates among children requiring renal-replacement therapy remain substantially higher than those among children without end-stage renal disease. Increasing the proportion of children treated with renal transplantation rather than with dialysis can improve survival further.",0

Our study deals with 55 chronic psychotic patients treated with neuroleptics and varied correctors of resulting Parkinson disorders. Akineton has been substituted for the preceding antiparkinson drugs. We may come to the following conclusions = Akineton is effective upon neuroleptic syndrom, gives few or no untoward reactions, has no toxicologic effects, shows no incompatibility with any other drug. It is very satisfactory to have at our disposal a drug effective in small doses and having a slow effect within average of 24 hours. ",0
2711,2711,15056141,Intermittent topical 5-fluorouracil is effective without significant irritation in the treatment of actinic keratoses but prolongs treatment duration,"Controversy exists as to whether treatment of actinic keratoses with intermittent doses of topical 5-fluorouracil is effective in the absence of significant irritation. To evaluate the efficacy and degree of irritation of 5-fluorouracil as a function of its application frequency. A total of 85 actinic keratoses in 53 patients were treated, initially with four applications per week for the first week. After this first week, if intolerable irritation arose, patients were instructed to reduce application frequency to two times per week for the rest of the treatment period. Treatment was completed for 95.4% of the lesions included, with healing of 88.6% of them. The mean time to healing was 7.4 weeks (with four applications weekly) and 10.2 weeks (with two applications). The healing rate was similar in the two groups. Significant correlations (p<0.001) were observed between application frequency and time to healing. Intermittent 5-fluorouracil treatment is effective without causing significant irritation, but time to healing increases with declining application frequency. ",0
2186,2186,10373070,Incidence and outcome of Clostridium difficile infection following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation,"A retrospective evaluation of 200 consecutive recipients of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was conducted to ascertain the incidence and outcome of infection with Clostridium difficile. The diagnosis was confirmed in 14 patients with diarrhea (15 episodes) at a median of 33 days after stem cell infusion. Five patients were neutropenic at the time of diagnosis. Every individual had adverse known risk factors such as recent or current use of antibiotic, corticosteroid and antiviral therapy, recent administration of myeloablative chemotherapy and numerous, prolonged periods of hospitalization. Diarrhea, frequently hemorrhagic, was the most common presenting feature along with fever, abdominal cramps and abdominal distention. Diagnosis was established by the stool-cytotoxin test. Response to standard treatment with oral vancomycin or metronidazole was prompt despite the presence of several adverse prognostic features in these patients. There was only one instance of relapse which was also treated successfully. Several transplant-related variables such as age, sex, underlying malignancy, myelo-ablative regimen, duration of neutropenia, and prophylactic use of oral ampicillin underwent statistical analysis but failed to be predictive of C. difficile infection in such a setting. Finally, C. difficile is not uncommon after autologous PBSCT and must be included in the differential diagnosis in any such patient with diarrhea. ",0
9168,9168,8637535,The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on muscle size and strength in normal men,"""BACKGROUND: Athletes often take androgenic steroids in an attempt to increase their strength. The efficacy of these substances for this purpose is unsubstantiated, however. METHODS: We randomly assigned 43 normal men to one of four groups: placebo with no exercise; testosterone with no exercise; placebo plus exercise; and testosterone plus exercise. The men received injections of 600 mg of testosterone enanthate or placebo weekly for 10 weeks. The men in the exercise groups performed standardized weight-lifting exercises three times weekly. Before and after the treatment period, fat-free mass was determined by underwater weighing, muscle size was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and the strength of the arms and legs was assessed by bench-press and squatting exercises, respectively. RESULTS: Among the men in the no-exercise groups, those given testosterone had greater increases than those given placebo in muscle size in their arms (mean [+/-SE] change in triceps area, 424 +/- 104 vs. -81 +/- 109 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and legs (change in quadriceps area, 607 +/- 123 vs. -131 +/- 111 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and greater increases in strength in the bench-press (9 +/- 4 vs. -1 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05) and squatting exercises (16 +/- 4 vs. 3 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05). The men assigned to testosterone and exercise had greater increases in fat-free mass (6.1 +/- 0.6 kg) and muscle size (triceps area, 501 +/- 104 square millimeters; quadriceps area, 1174 +/- 91 square millimeters) than those assigned to either no-exercise group, and greater increases in muscle strength (bench-press strength, 22 +/- 2 kg; squatting-exercise capacity, 38 +/- 4 kg) than either no-exercise group. Neither mood nor behavior was altered in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Supraphysiologic doses of testosterone, especially when combined with strength training, increase fat-free mass and muscle size and strength in normal men.""",1
171,171,787788,Vitamin C and acute illness in Navajo school children,"To evaluate earlier observations, including our own, showing usefulness of vitamin C for managing the common cold, we performed a double-blind trial of vitamin C versus placebo in 868 children. There was no difference in number becoming ill (133 versus 129), number of episodes (166 versus 159) or mean illness duration (5.5 versus 5.8 days) between the groups. Children receiving vitamin C had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus (six versus 13, P less than 0.10), but no difference in overall complicated illness rate (24 versus 25). Plasma ascorbic acid levels were higher in the vitamin group 24 to 26 hours after supplementation (1.28 versus 1.04 mg per 100 ml, P less than 0.01). Children with high plasma ascorbic acid concentrations had longer mean illness (6.8 versus 4.0 days, P less than 0.05) than those with low levels.

8623,8623,6672506,The liver in fatal exertional heatstroke,"We describe the chronology of hepatic histopathologic alterations in 50 cases of fatal exertional heatstroke related to military training. Five patients who died in the field demonstrated the earliest alterations: fatty change (sometimes microvacuolar), amitotic hepatocellular regeneration, accumulation of hemosiderin, and congestion. In addition, the sinusoids contained polymorphonuclear leukocytes, immature erythroid and granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and lymphocytes. Fibrin was not evident. The other 45 patients, who survived up to 8 days following hospitalization, also demonstrated these findings. Microvacuolar fatty change was common in this group of patients, and degenerated hepatocytes resembled Councilman bodies. Coagulative degeneration and submassive necrosis were uncommon. Of those surviving over 12 h, more than half had bile stasis (sometimes ductal), frequently associated with acute cholangitis and ductular proliferation. Regeneration and pigmentary alterations have not been recognized as early hepatic findings in heatstroke, nor have intrasinusoidal bone marrow elements, ductal bile stasis, and acute cholangitis been described. Possible pathogenic factors, other than hyperthermia and sequellae of shock, include obesity, recent illnesses and immunizations, bacterial toxemia, hemolysis, and bone marrow injury.",1
3669,3669,18346652,Local thrombolysis in patients with dural venous thrombosis unresponsive to heparin,"We sought to study the efficacy and complications of local thrombolysis using urokinase in cases of cortical vein thrombosis unresponsive to conventional heparin therapy. Patients with clinical and radiologic diagnosis of cortical vein thrombosis were taken for local thrombolysis using femoral vein approach if they did not respond to heparin therapy after 5 days of administration of the drug. Urokinase was used as the thrombolytic agent and dose was decided depending on the recanalization obtained during the procedure. Of the 3 patients treated, two had complete recanalization and one had partial recanalization. Two had dramatic recovery of the clinical symptoms. One patient in whom thrombolysis was delayed had partial recovery. None had any complications related to the treatment. Local thrombolytic therapy is effective in recanalization of thrombosed sinus. It is worth considering in dire circumstances especially when a patient fails to respond to heparin. However, randomized controlled trials are necessary before any firm recommendations can be made as to whether it can be used as a primary modality of treatment in cases of cortical vein thrombosis.

13104,13104,23596311,HLA haplotype determines hapten or p-i T cell reactivity to flucloxacillin,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a main cause of drug withdrawal. A particularly interesting example is flucloxacillin (FLUX)-DILI, which is associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele. At present, the mechanism of FLUX-DILI is not understood, but the HLA association suggests a role for activated T cells in the pathomechanism of liver damage. To understand the interaction among FLUX, HLA molecules, and T cells, we generated FLUX-reacting T cells from FLUX-naive HLA-B*57:01(+) and HLA-B*57:01(-) healthy donors and investigated the mechanism of T cell stimulation. We found that FLUX stimulates CD8(+) T cells in two distinct manners. On one hand, FLUX was stably presented on various HLA molecules, resistant to extensive washing and dependent on proteasomal processing, suggesting a hapten mechanism. On the other hand, in HLA-B*57:01(+) individuals, we observed a pharmacological interaction with immune receptors (p-i)-based T cell reactivity. FLUX was presented in a labile manner that was further characterized by independence of proteasomal processing and immediate T cell clone activation upon stimulation with FLUX in solution. This p-i-based T cell stimulation was restricted to the HLA-B*57:01 allele. We conclude that the presence of HLA-B*57:01 drives CD8(+) T cell responses to the penicillin-derivative FLUX toward nonhapten mechanism.",1
827,827,2816238,Displacement of warfarin from human serum proteins by halothane anaesthesia,"The in vitro effects of the halothane metabolite, trifluoroacetic acid, on the binding of warfarin to human serum proteins have been investigated. An increase in the percentage of free warfarin following incubation with different concentrations of trifluoroacetic acid (1 and 4 mmol/l) was observed. In addition, protein binding of warfarin was studied in serum from patients undergoing halothane anaesthesia (1-2.5%; 2.5 h). After 24 h from the end of the halothane anaesthesia, an increase in the percentage of free warfarin was also detected (0.92 +/- 0.06% at 24 h vs 0.60 +/- 0.02% before halothane administration; P less than 0.005). We conclude that halothane anaesthesia may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of warfarin in the postoperative period following anaesthetic procedures. ",0
8086,8086,3934499,Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency--the effects of betaine treatment in pyridoxine-responsive patients,"""Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency may be responsive to pyridoxine, a precursor of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, and the amount of residual enzyme activity present is the probable determinant of this. In six treated pyridoxine-responsive patients whose biochemical control of fasting plasma amino acid levels appeared optimal, we assessed the effects on plasma amino acids of standard oral methionine loads (4g/m2 of body area) before and after adding betaine (trimethylglycine) 6 g/d, to the treatment regimen of pyridoxine and folic acid. Our aim was to define the capacity of these patients to metabolize methionine and to determine whether betaine would effect a reduction in postload homocysteine levels. During the 24 hours after the methionine challenge all patients had higher plasma methionine and homocysteine and lower cysteine than did 17 normal subjects. After betaine these homocysteine responses were reduced to near normal, and there was a trend toward increased methionine. There was a direct correlation between premethionine fasting homocysteine and mean homocysteine responses during the 24 hours following the methionine load, both before (r = 0.79) and after betaine (r = 0.71). Betaine also increased plasma cysteine levels in patients with the more severe biochemical abnormalities. After betaine there were modest increases in plasma serine (mean increase 25%; P less than 0.025). Since the vascular complications of homocystinuria are related to increased plasma homocysteine, betaine therapy may reduce this risk in patients receiving a standard pyridoxine and folic acid regimen in whom there are abnormal homocysteine responses after a standard methionine load.""",1

Patients possessing HLA DR3 had a significantly greater frequency of side effects than patients lacking this antigen. It was particularly noticed that DR3 positive patients on gold treatment had an 11 times higher risk of getting proteinuria than those without DR3. The lowest frequency of side effects was seen in DR7 positives. No significant differences between the DR antigen groups with respect to skin eruptions, liver reactions, or leucopenia were evident.",1
4868,4868,24312465,Low body weight in females is a risk factor for increased tenofovir exposure and drug-related adverse events,"Treatment with tenofovir sometimes leads to non-reversible kidney and/or bone diseases. Factors associated with these drug-related adverse events are poorly characterized. Our objective was to investigate such factors in patients treated long term with daily tenofovir. One-hundred Caucasian HIV-positive patients with basal creatinine clearance >80 mL/min treated with tenofovir for at least 6 months and with at least one assessment of tenofovir plasma trough concentrations were considered. Tenofovir-associated adverse events were defined as the appearance of pathological proteinuria, worsening of renal function or bone demineralization. By multivariate regression analysis, we found that serum creatinine (p = 0.003) and body weight (p = 0.002) were the factors independently associated with plasma tenofovir concentrations. In particular, women with body weight<50 kg had significantly higher plasma tenofovir concentrations than those weighting >50 Kg (160±93 vs.71±52 ng/mL, p<0.001). High tenofovir plasma trough concentrations and the age of the patients were independently associated with the development of drug-related kidney and bone toxicity. In this retrospective study we have shown that HIV-infected women with low body weight are at risk to be exposed to high tenofovir plasma trough concentrations, ultimately resulting in a significant hazard to develop long-term tenofovir complications.

10029,10029,11825325,Sirolimus: a comprehensive review,"Sirolimus (Rapamune), Wyeth-Ayerst, Madison, NJ) is a new, potent, immunosuppressant that is emerging as a foundation for long-term immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation. The drug acts during both co-stimulatory activation and cytokine-driven pathways via a unique mechanism: inhibition of a multifunctional serine-threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Although there is no a priori reason to assume it, sirolimus displays a synergistic interaction to enhance the efficacy of cyclosporin A (CsA). In trials wherein the concentrations of CsA and sirolimus were tightly controlled, rates of acute rejection episodes were < 10%, despite markedly reduced exposures to each agent. In pivotal multi-centre blinded dose-controlled trials, the rates of acute rejection episodes within 12 months following administration of 2 or 5 mg/day sirolimus in combination with CsA and steroids were reduced to 19 and 14%, respectively. Since the inhibitory effect of sirolimus disables virtually all responses to cytokine mediators due to the widespread involvement of mTOR in multiple signalling pathways, the agent is likely also to retard proliferation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, an important component of the immuno-obliterative processes associated with chronic rejection. The advantages of this unique therapeutic action combined with an intrinsic lack of nephrotoxicity are counterbalanced by myelosuppressive and hyperlipidaemic side effects. Ongoing studies are assessing whether the long-term benefits of sirolimus to permit reduction in exposure to or elimination of calcineurin inhibitors ameliorate the progression of chronic nephropathy, the condition that erodes long-term renal transplant survival.",1

It is classified as a subset of nodular fasciitis and was first reported in 1980. This study evaluates the literature for common characteristics that may affect diagnosis and treamtent. We describe the case of a 13-month-old girl with a history of accidental head trauma 7 months before presentation and the case of a 5-month-old girl with an expansile skull lesion. We also performed a systematic review of the reported data on cranial fasciitis, including a total of 57 reported studies with 80 unique cases. There were 80 total cases reviewed in the literature. There was a male predominence, 1.75:1. The average age at presentation was 5.2 years. The most common causes for this lesion were idiopathic (65%), blunt trauma (14%) and radiation therapy (7%). Overall, there was a 9% recurrence rate following treatment. We report the characteristics at presentation, including, to the best of our knowledge, the first account of gender differences, and the treatment modalities used in the included studies and the implications in relation to the recurrence rates.

Results from previous studies on ginsenosides' effects on human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes are inconsistent and confusing. Herein, we first evaluated the inhibitory effects of fifteen ginsenosides and sapogenins on human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes by using commercially available fluorescent probes. The structure-activity relationship of their effects on the P450s was also explored and a pharmacophore model was established for CYP3A4. Moreover, substrate-dependent phenomena were found in ginsenosides' effects on CYP3A4 when another fluorescent probe was used, and were further confirmed in tests with conventional drug probes and human liver microsomes. These substrate-dependent effects of the ginsenosides may provide an explanation for the inconsistent results obtained in previous GDI reports.",1
4989,4989,24432676,Anti-depressive effect of acupuncture on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors],"To evaluate anti-depressive effects of acupuncture on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Totally 60 patients with depression were randomly assigned to the control group (30 cases) and the treatment group (30 cases). All patients took one kind of SSRIs. Those in the treatment group were additionally treated by acupuncture. All were treated for 6 weeks. Patients' efficacies were evaluated with Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Eisenberg antidepressant side effects scale (Asberg). Compared with the control group after 6 weeks of treatment, the cured-markedly effective rate was improved by 33.4% in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The HAMD was lower in the treatment group. The tendency of interaction of sleep disorder factor and anxiety/somatization factor was different between at the end of 1-week treatment and at the end of 6-week treatment in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The SDS score decreased at the end of 6-week treatment in the treatment group. The reduction rate was elevated by 19.23% (P < 0.05). By the end of 6-week treatment, the average score of Asberg decreased by 3.77 score in average in the treatment group, while it decreased by 0.07 score in average in the control group (P < 0.05). Acupuncture could effectively improve anti-depressive effects of SSRIs and reduce their adverse reactions. ",0
9563,9563,10217058,Criteria and recommendations for vitamin C intake,"Recommendations for vitamin C intake are under revision by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Since 1989 when the last recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg was published, extensive biochemical, molecular, epidemiologic, and clinical data have become available. New recommendations can be based on the following 9 criteria: dietary availability, steady-state concentrations in plasma in relationship to dose, steady-state concentrations in tissues in relationship to dose, bioavailability, urine excretion, adverse effects, biochemical and molecular function in relationship to vitamin concentration, direct beneficial effects and epidemiologic observations in relationship to dose, and prevention of deficiency. We applied these criteria to the Food and Nutrition Board's new guidelines, the Dietary Reference Intakes, which include 4 reference values. The estimated average requirement (EAR) is the amount of nutrient estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a life-stage and gender group. Based on an EAR of 100 mg/d of vitamin C, the RDA is proposed to be 120 mg/d. If the EAR cannot be determined, an adequate intake (AI) amount is recommended instead of an RDA. The AI was estimated to be either 200 mg/d from 5 servings of fruits and vegetables or 100 mg/d of vitamin C to prevent deficiency with a margin of safety. The final classification, the tolerable upper intake level, is the highest daily level of nutrient intake that does not pose risk or adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the population. This amount is proposed to be less than 1 g of vitamin C daily. Physicians can tell patients that 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day may be beneficial in preventing cancer and providing sufficient vitamin C intake for healthy people, and that 1 g or more of vitamin C may have adverse consequences in some people.",1

766,766,2648143,Graft-versus-host disease as adoptive immunotherapy in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms,"The occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia is thought to decrease the probability of recurrence. To study this effect (called adoptive immunotherapy) we modified the prophylaxis of GVHD in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms (mostly leukemia) who received bone marrow transplants. Patients under 30 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three regimens of post-transplantation immunosuppression: Group I (n = 44) received a standard course of methotrexate for 102 days after transplantation, Group II (n = 40) received an abbreviated (11-day) course of methotrexate, and Group III (n = 25) received the standard course of methotrexate plus viable buffy-coat cells from the marrow donors. All 109 patients received cyclophosphamide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight on each of two days), total-body irradiation (2.25 Gy daily for seven days), and unmodified marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors. The frequency of GVHD of Grades II through IV was 25 percent in Group I, 59 percent in Group II, and 82 percent in Group III (P = 0.0001). The incidence of chronic GVHD, however, did not differ significantly among the groups (33, 51, and 44 percent, respectively), nor did the five-year probability of recurrence of disease (38, 45, and 33 percent, respectively). However, mortality from causes other than cancer was 34 percent in Group I, 45 percent in Group II, and 64 percent in Group III (I vs. III, P = 0.024); the deaths were due primarily to infections complicating the course of GVHD. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 3.9 to 7.4), disease-free survival was 41 percent in Group I, 30 percent in Group II, and 24 percent in Group III (the differences were not statistically significant). We conclude that abbreviating methotrexate prophylaxis or infusing donor buffy-coat cells increased the incidence of acute GVHD and related mortality without altering the incidence of chronic GVHD or the recurrence of malignant disease.",0
4388,4388,22922474,Long-term outcome of anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation for intractable epilepsy,"Many patients with epilepsy have persistent seizures despite treatment with maximal antiepileptic drug therapy and are not candidates for resective brain surgery. We investigated the effectiveness of seizure reduction after anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) stimulation in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus. Patients included in this study had poorly controlled seizures, despite anticonvulsant medication, and were not candidates for surgical resection of an identifiable seizure focus. Fifteen patients with medically refractory epilepsy underwent the placement of bilateral DBS electrodes in the anterior thalamus. The seizure frequency was monitored and compared with the preimplantation baseline. The treatment demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the seizure frequency, with a mean reduction of 70.4% (mean follow-up, 27 months). Two of the patients had a remarkable reduction of seizure frequency. It seems to be important that the short-term outcome of ATN DBS reflects the long-term outcome directly. The correlation between the seizure type, characteristics and anticonvulsant effects of ATN DBS did not exhibit significance because of the small number of cases. Therefore, a longer-term follow-up with a larger group of patients is required to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment modality. ",0

12565,12565,22045675,Circulating microRNAs as potential markers of human drug-induced liver injury,"""UNLABELLED: New biomarkers of liver injury are required in the clinic and in preclinical pharmaceutical evaluation. Previous studies demonstrate that two liver-enriched microRNAs (miR-122 and miR-192) are promising biomarkers of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (APAP-ALI) in mice. We have examined these molecules, for the first time, in humans with APAP poisoning. Serum miR-122 and miR-192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients, compared to healthy controls (median DeltaDeltaCt [25th, 75th percentile]) (miR-122: 1,265 [491, 4,270] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P < 0.0001; miR-192: 6.9 [2.0, 29.2] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P < 0.0001). A heart-enriched miR-1 showed no difference between APAP-ALI patients and controls, whereas miR-218 (brain-enriched) was slightly higher in the APAP-ALI cohort (0.17 [0.07, 0.50] versus 0.07 [0.04, 0.12]; P = 0.01). In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, miR-122 and -192 were modestly higher, compared to controls (miR-122: 32.0 [21.1, 40.9] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P = 0.006; miR-192: 1.2 [0.74, 1.9] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P = 0.005), but miR-122 and -192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients than CKD patients (miR-122: P < 0.0001; miR-192: P < 0.0004). miR-122 correlated with peak ALT levels in the APAP-ALI cohort (Pearson R = 0.46, P = 0.0005), but not with prothrombin time. miR-122 was also raised alongside peak ALT levels in a group of patients with non-APAP ALI. Day 1 serum miR-122 levels were almost 2-fold higher in APAP-ALI patients who satisfied King's College Criteria (KCC), compared to those who did not satisfy KCC, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.15). CONCLUSION: This work provides the first evidence for the potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers of human drug-induced liver injury.""",1
2712,2712,15056517,Multiple versus single antipsychotic agents for hospitalized psychiatric patients: case-control study of risks versus benefits,"Since use of multiple drugs to treat psychiatric patients is increasing, and research on this practice is rare, the authors carried out a retrospective case-control study of multiple versus single antipsychotic treatment in psychiatric inpatients. Inpatient treatment groups receiving either antipsychotic monotherapy or polytherapy were matched in terms of age, sex, diagnostic category, and admission clinical ratings (Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] and Clinical Global Impression [CGI]), which yielded 70 subject pairs. They were compared in terms of total chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose, changes in total daily dose, length of hospitalization, incidence of adverse effects, and changes in clinical ratings (CGI, GAF, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score) between admission and discharge. Initial doses were closely similar at admission for both treatment groups, but the median total final antipsychotic dose was 78% higher for those receiving antipsychotic polytherapy versus monotherapy. Also, median length of stay in the hospital was 55% (8.5 days) longer, and risk of adverse effects was 56% higher with polytherapy, whereas clinical improvement scores were similar (within 11%) for both treatments. Short-term treatment with multiple antipsychotics was associated with major increases in drug exposure, adverse events, and time in the hospital but with no apparent gain in clinical benefit. These findings require further testing in controlled prospective studies. ",0

POLG1 was sequenced in patients from different European diagnostic and research centres to define the phenotypic spectrum and advance understanding of the recurrence risks. Mutations were identified in 38 cases, with the majority being sporadic compound heterozygotes. Eighty-nine DNA sequence changes were identified, including 2 predicted to alter a splice site, 1 predicted to cause a premature stop codon and 13 predicted to cause novel amino acid substitutions. The majority of children had a mutation in the linker region, often 1399G-->A (A467T), and a mutation affecting the polymerase domain. Others had mutations throughout the gene, and 11 had 3 or more substitutions. The clinical presentation ranged from the neonatal period to late adult life, with an overlapping phenotypic spectrum from severe encephalopathy and liver failure to late-onset external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, myopathy and isolated muscle pain or epilepsy. There was a strong gender bias in children, with evidence of an environmental interaction with sodium valproate. POLG1 mutations cause an overlapping clinical spectrum of disease with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. 1399G-->A (A467T) is common in children, but complete POLG1 sequencing is required to identify multiple mutations that can have complex implications for genetic counselling.",1

The diagnosis was bladder cancer (TCC, G3, T4N3M1) from detailed examination. With his advanced age and lowered ADL, the family did not wish for aggressive treatment, so no combination multidrug chemotherapy was attempted. Instead he was given 300 mg/day UFT per os. After 4 weeks administration, the metastatic focus decreased and tended to contract; at the same time gross observation revealed no more bloody urine. Moreover, following 7 weeks of administration, the bladder tumor disappeared, the lung metastatic focus showed overall shrinkage of over 50%, the lymph node metastasis also was more than 50% less, and the case was considered to be PR. The literature reveals UFT was efficacious in only 2 other cases of progressive bladder carcinoma. Since UFT has fewer complications, such as myelosuppression, among antitumor agent, it is considered worth trying in cases where intensive treatment is not feasible. ",0
1540,1540,7678188,Successful treatment of ongoing intestinal allograft rejection permits recovery of graft structure and function,"Acute rejection episodes often complicate clinical small bowel transplantation, which prompted us to investigate whether such episodes can be reversed and the intestinal graft salvaged. Inbred Lewis rats that received fully allogeneic Brown-Norway small bowel allografts were treated with cyclosporin A (10 mg/kg) for 5 days, and the drug was then discontinued. Clinical and histologic signs of acute rejection developed, and the animals were subsequently treated with FK 506 (2 mg/kg) on days 14, 16, and 18. Survival was significantly prolonged (201.7 +/- 46.8 days) when compared with animals that were not administered FK 506 (16.5 +/- 0.8 days) or allograft recipients that received no immunosuppressive therapy (10.8 +/- 0.7 days). The histologic changes and functional impairment due to rejection that were observed prior to the start of the FK 506-therapy were reversed. However, biopsy specimens of all animals exhibited features of chronic rejection. This study provides evidence that acute rejection of intestinal allografts can be successfully treated with a short course of FK 506. ",0
12514,12514,21904569,An update on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main treatment approach in advanced prostate cancer and in recent years has primarily involved the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. However, despite their efficacy, GnRH agonists have several drawbacks associated with their mode of action. These include an initial testosterone surge and testosterone microsurges on repeat administration. GnRH antagonists provide an alternative approach to ADT with a more direct mode of action that involves immediate blockade of GnRH receptors. Antagonists produce a more rapid suppression of testosterone (and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) without a testosterone surge or microsurges and appear to offer an effective and well tolerated option for the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer. Comparisons with GnRH agonists have shown GnRH antagonists to be at least as effective in achieving and maintaining castrate testosterone levels in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, with antagonists, the lack of an initial testosterone surge (which may cause clinical flare) may allow more rapid relief of symptoms related to prostate cancer, avoid the need for concomitant antiandrogens to prevent clinical flare (so avoiding any antiandrogen-associated adverse events) and allow GnRH antagonist use in patients with high tumour burden and/or acute problems such as spinal cord compression. Although several antagonists have been investigated, only degarelix and abarelix are currently available for clinical use in prostate cancer. Currently, degarelix is the most extensively studied and widely available agent in this class. Degarelix is one of a newer generation of antagonists which, in a comprehensive and ongoing clinical development programme, has been shown to provide rapid, profound and sustained testosterone suppression without the systemic allergic reactions associated with earlier antagonists. This review examines the currently available data on GnRH antagonists in prostate cancer.",1
2645,2645,15043392,Severe acute respiratory syndrome: scientific and anecdotal evidence for drug treatment,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a highly infectious novel coronavirus (CoV), predominantly presents with severe pneumonitis leading to respiratory failure and death in approximately 10% of victims. Most cases present, after an incubation of 2 to 11 days, with fever and chills, which are followed by dry cough and dyspnea before the onset of respiratory failure. The management of SARS is controversial, largely due to the lack of data from controlled trials, which were logistically impossible to design or execute at the time of the overwhelming outbreak between March and June 2003. The use of an antiviral is logical although there is no effective agent against SARS-CoV, with the widespread use of ribavirin in 2003 attracting considerable scepticism. The use of ribavirin as a monotherapy in SARS is not recommended. Retrospective data suggest that administration of the anti-HIV drug Kaletra in combination with ribavirin could reduce mortality and incidence of respiratory failure. The use of corticosteroid was based on the similarity between SARS and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Corticosteroid use is considered important in subsets of patients with SARS. As SARS may still resurge, it is imperative that past experience is analyzed. This review will attempt to address the rationale for pharmacotherapy in SARS using anecdotal and the limited published data. ",0

Mice homozygous for a FAH gene disruption have a neonatal lethal phenotype caused by liver dysfunction and do not represent an adequate model of the human disease. Here we demonstrate that treatment of affected animals with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzyol)-1,3-cyclohexanedione abolished neonatal lethality, corrected liver function and partially normalized the altered expression pattern of hepatic mRNAs. The prolonged lifespan of affected animals resulted in a phenotype analogous to human tyrosinaemia type I including hepatocellular carcinoma. The adult FAH-/- mouse will serve as useful model for studies of the pathophysiology and treatment of hereditary tyrosinaemia type I as well as hepatic cancer.",1
1071,1071,3491317,Endoscopic sclerotherapy versus portacaval shunt in patients with severe cirrhosis and acute variceal hemorrhage. Long-term follow-up,"In a continuation of a trial for which preliminary results were reported in the Journal two years ago, a total of 64 patients with Child Class C cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage requiring six or more units of blood were randomly assigned to receive either a portacaval shunt (32 patients) or endoscopic sclerotherapy (32 patients). The duration of initial hospitalization and the total amount of blood transfused during hospitalization were significantly less in the patients receiving sclerotherapy (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in short-term survival (50 percent of the sclerotherapy group were discharged alive, as compared with 44 percent of the shunt-surgery group). Both groups were followed for a mean of 530 days after randomization. Rebleeding from varices, the duration of rehospitalization for hemorrhage, and transfusions received after discharge were all significantly greater in the sclerotherapy group (P less than 0.001). Forty percent of the sclerotherapy-treated patients discharged alive (7 of 16 patients) ultimately required surgical treatment for bleeding varices, despite a mean of 6.1 treatment sessions. Health care costs and long-term survival did not differ significantly between the groups (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that although endoscopic sclerotherapy is as good as surgical shunting for the acute management of variceal hemorrhage in poor-risk patients with massive bleeding, sclerotherapy-treated patients in whom varices are not obliterated and bleeding continues should be considered for elective shunt surgery.",0

The chicken liver homogenate contained 36,000 IU of vitamin A per 120 gm. Since infants often receive 4,000 units of vitamin A daily from fortified milk and vitamin supplements, they probably cannot be fed 60 gm of chicken liver safely more often than once weekly.",1

In addition to drugs that release or mimic the effect of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), this could include drugs that inhibit: reuptake of norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin); bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or the cannabinoid receptors; and some peptides that reduce food intake. The sympathomimetic drugs phentermine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendimetrazine--so named because they mimic many effects of norepinephrine--are only approved in a few countries, and then only for short-term use. Sibutramine, a norepinephrine-5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor, is approved for long-term use. Several new mechanisms for drug action are under investigation. Appetite suppressants should be viewed as useful adjuncts to diet and physical activity and might help selected patients to achieve and maintain weight loss.""",1

METHODS: In this prospective study, the entire ABCB4 gene coding sequence was analysed by DNA sequencing in 50 unrelated women with ICP defined by pruritus and raised serum alanine aminotransferase activity or bile acid concentration, with recovery after delivery. Genomic variants detected in patients with ICP were sought in 107 control pregnant women. Patients with ICP and controls were of Caucasian origin. RESULTS: Eight genomic variants were observed. One nonsense mutation (p.Arg144Stop) and two missense mutations (p.Ser320Phe and p.Thr775Met) were revealed each in one heterozygous patient. A third missense mutation (p.Arg590Gln) was detected in three heterozygous patients and in two homozygous patients also homozygous for a particular haplotype of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (c.175C>T, c.504T>C, c.711A>T). The chromosomal frequency of the p.Arg590Gln variant was significantly different between the ICP and control group (7.0% vs 0.5%; p = 0.0017; OR 16.03, 95% CI 1.94 to 132.16). An association was also found between allele T of the c.504T>C silent nucleotide polymorphism and ICP (68.0% vs 53.7%; p = 0.017; OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.11). The chromosomal frequency of the p.Arg652Gly variant did not differ between the ICP and control group (p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 16% of Caucasian patients with ICP bear ABCB4 gene mutations, and confirms the significant involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of this complex disorder.""",1
6745,6745,30761815,Current perspectives for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia,"With an annual incidence of 1-2 in a million, Ph*(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease that makes myeloid neoplastic cells breed out of control. This BCR-ABL(+) myeloproliferative disease makes up about 15%-20% of all leukemia cases in adults. CML is seen more in males than females, with a rate of three to two. However, it does not show differences in prevalence in terms of age. CML consists of three clinical phases. The first one is the chronic phase, defined by rising white blood cell levels and also by myeloid proliferation and bone marrow maturation. While this phase does not exhibit complications, in diagnosis, it comprises most of the patients. The second phase is the accelerated phase, which the disease progresses to if it is not treated or does not respond to treatment. This usually takes about 3 years. The third phase is the blastic phase. The chronic phase can still progress to the next two phases within the first 2 years, with a rate of 10%. In the following years, the possibility increases by 15%-20% each year. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are revolutionary drugs for the management of disease course in CML. The aim of this review is to assess current approaches to CML patients' follow-up and treatment with TKIs. A literature search on CML and TKIs was made in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with particular focus on randomized clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines, and expert opinions. In managing CML, various treatment methods have been utilized for many decades. Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alpha was the primary tool, which was then complemented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT was successful in slowing the disease down in the long term and curing up to 50% of patients. Then the coming of the imatinib era opened up different treatment perspectives. For the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs are successfully used in distinct CML disease states. The survival benefits of TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib for CML patients are outstanding. TKI-related adverse events could impact the clinical course, especially in long-term drug administrations. The current aim for CML disease management in the TKI era is to provide age- and sex-matched normal life duration to CML patients. ",0
10515,10515,14625346,Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity,"""The analgesic acetaminophen causes a potentially fatal, hepatic centrilobular necrosis when taken in overdose. The initial phases of toxicity were described in Dr. Gillette's laboratory in the 1970s. These findings indicated that acetaminophen was metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes to a reactive metabolite that depleted glutathione (GSH) and covalently bound to protein. It was shown that repletion of GSH prevented the toxicity. This finding led to the development of the currently used antidote N-acetylcysteine. The reactive metabolite was subsequently identified to be N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Although covalent binding has been shown to be an excellent correlate of toxicity, a number of other events have been shown to occur and are likely important in the initiation and repair of toxicity. Recent data have shown that nitrated tyrosine residues as well as acetaminophen adducts occur in the necrotic cells following toxic doses of acetaminophen. Nitrotyrosine was postulated to be mediated by peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species formed by the very rapid reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO). Peroxynitrite is normally detoxified by GSH, which is depleted in acetaminophen toxicity. NO synthesis (serum nitrate plus nitrite) was dramatically increased following acetaminophen. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, acetaminophen did not increase NO synthesis or tyrosine nitration; however, histological evidence indicated no difference in toxicity. Acetaminophen did not cause hepatic lipid peroxidation in wild-type mice but did cause lipid peroxidation in iNOS knockout mice. These data suggest that NO may play a role in controlling lipid peroxidation and that reactive nitrogen/oxygen species may be important in toxicity. The source of the superoxide has not been identified, but our recent finding that NADPH oxidase knockout mice were equally sensitive to acetaminophen and had equal nitration of tyrosine suggests that the superoxide is not from the activation of Kupffer cells. It was postulated that NAPQI-mediated mitochondrial injury may be the source of the superoxide. In addition, the significance of cytokines and chemokines in the development of toxicity and repair processes has been demonstrated by several recent studies. IL-1beta is increased early in acetaminophen toxicity and may be important in iNOS induction. Other cytokines, such as IL-10, macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), appear to be involved in hepatocyte repair and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines.""",1

In five subjects, a four-hour infusion of somatostatin (500 micrograms per hour) had no definite effect on platelet count, leukocyte count, hematocrit, platelet adhesiveness and aggregation, bleeding time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen levels. A similar infusion for 18 hours in three subjects was likewise without effect. These studies indicate that somatostatin does not affect coagulation and platelet function in man and that its prolonged administration lacks ostensible toxicity.",0
6934,6934,31405828,Long-term macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults: an individual participant data meta-analysis,"Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·36 to 0·66; p<0·0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0·46, 0·34 to 0·61; p<0·0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2·93 points, 0·03 to 5·83; p=0·048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account. European Respiratory Society. ",0

The monoclonal antibody romosozumab binds to sclerostin and increases bone formation. METHODS: In a phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-group study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of romosozumab over a 12-month period in 419 postmenopausal women, 55 to 85 years of age, who had low bone mineral density (a T score of -2.0 or less at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and -3.5 or more at each of the three sites). Participants were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous romosozumab monthly (at a dose of 70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg) or every 3 months (140 mg or 210 mg), subcutaneous placebo, or an open-label active comparator--oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or subcutaneous teriparatide (20 ?g daily). The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 12 months. Secondary end points included percentage changes in bone mineral density at other sites and in markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: All dose levels of romosozumab were associated with significant increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, including an increase of 11.3% with the 210-mg monthly dose, as compared with a decrease of 0.1% with placebo and increases of 4.1% with alendronate and 7.1% with teriparatide. Romosozumab was also associated with large increases in bone mineral density at the total hip and femoral neck, as well as transitory increases in bone-formation markers and sustained decreases in a bone-resorption marker. Except for mild, generally nonrecurring injection-site reactions with romosozumab, adverse events were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with low bone mass, romosozumab was associated with increased bone mineral density and bone formation and with decreased bone resorption.

Ninety-eight patients with clinicopathologically proven chronic hepatitis B were randomly allocated to 3 groups: 1) group A received a 26-week course of Talpha with a 1.6-mg subcutaneous injection two times a week (T6 group); 2) group B received the same regimen as group A, but Talpha therapy extended for 52 weeks (T12 group); and 3) group C served as a control group and was followed up for 18 months without specific treatment (T0 group). The three groups were comparable in clinicohistological features at entry. The complete virological response rate (clearance of serum hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA and hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]) was higher in group A (40.6%) and group B (26.5%) than in group C (9.4%) (group A vs. group C: P=.004; group B vs. group C: P=.068) when assessed 18 months after entry, although complete response rates among these three groups were similar when first assessed at the end of therapy. There was a trend for complete virological response to increase or accumulate gradually after the end of Talpha therapy. None of the responders lost hepatitis B surface antigen. Blinded histological assessment showed a significant improvement in treated patients, particularly in lobular necroinflammation and scores excluding fibrosis. No significant side effects were observed. These results suggest that a 26-week course of Talpha therapy is effective and safe in patients with chronic hepatitis B.",0
99,99,581782,Comparison of the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs with different ancillary properties in angina pectoris,"We compared the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents in 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. Acute dose-response studies showed that all five drugs improved exercise tolerance and reduced ST-segment depression, heart rate and blood pressure by a similar degree in comparison with a placebo (P less than 0.01). Near maximum improvement in exercise tolerance occurred when the acute cumulative oral dose had reached 160 mg for propranolol and oxprenolol, 200 mg for metoprolol and tolamolol and 400 mg for practolol. When these drugs were administered as a single doses, increase in walking time before the development of angina and reduction in ST-segment depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure all occurred within one hour and persisted for eight hours--effects markedly different from the response to a placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that non-cardioselective agents (propranolol and oxprenolol), cardioselective agents (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol), as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.",0

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among patients with chronic HCV infection and to assess whether vitamin A deficiency could be associated with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy. The analysis included 199 consecutive treatment-na?ve chronic HCV patients in whom pretreatment serum vitamin A and 25-OH vitamin D were measured; 119 healthy blood donors were used as controls. Median (interquartile range) serum vitamin A in HCV-positive patients was significantly lower than in controls: 256 ng/mL (128-440) versus 742 (624-942, P<0.0001). Overall sustained viral response was achieved in 122/199 patients, 46/109 infected by difficult to treat HCV genotypes. In these latter, 39/104 (37.5%) were nonresponders. At multivariate analysis, nonresponse to antiviral therapy was predicted by carriage of interleukin (IL)-28B T/* genotypes, baseline serum levels of ?GT>60 IU/mL, of HCV RNA>600,000 IU/mL, of vitamin A?100 ng/mL, and a cumulative dose of ribavirin?80%. Seventeen patients (9.0%) had both serum levels of vitamin A?100 ng/mL and of vitamin D?20 ng/mL; the presence of a combined vitamin A and D deficiency was found to be a strong independent predictor of nonresponse to antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients with chronic HCV infection have serum vitamin A deficiency. This condition is associated with nonresponse to antiviral therapy.",0

8092,8092,3944744,Hepatomegaly following short-term high-dose steroid therapy,"Children treated with large doses of corticosteroids were found to develop hepatomegaly within a few days. No relationship could be established between the condition for which steroids were given and the liver enlargement. Liver biopsy was thought to be indicated, and thus was performed in three children because of diagnostic uncertainty. The light and electron microscopic examinations revealed normal liver architecture, without edema, sinusoid engorgement, or inflammatory changes. The hepatocytes were distended by increased amounts of glycogen. In a pattern reminiscent of some glycogen storage diseases, mitochondria and other cytosol components were displaced toward the cell membrane or around the nucleus, which occasionally contained glycogen. Moderate sinusoidal compression, interhepatocytic free glycogen particles, and mild increase in lipid droplets were also found. It is concluded that the hepatomegaly noted in patients given short-term, high-dosage steroid therapy is due to excessive glycogen accumulation within parenchymal cells. This finding is in accordance with observations in animals, as well as with biochemical studies demonstrating hepatocytic glycogen deposition after steroid therapy. Being benign and reversible, early hepatomegaly following administration of high-dose corticosteroids should not influence the initial therapeutic plan required by the basic disease.",1

6974,6974,31553835,Step-Up Therapy in Black Children and Adults with Poorly Controlled Asthma,"BACKGROUND: Morbidity from asthma is disproportionately higher among black patients than among white patients, and black patients constitute the minority of participants in trials informing treatment. Data indicate that patients with inadequately controlled asthma benefit more from addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) than from increased glucocorticoids; however, these data may not be informative for treatment in black patients. METHODS: We conducted two prospective, randomized, double-blind trials: one involving children and the other involving adolescents and adults. In both trials, the patients had at least one grandparent who identified as black and had asthma that was inadequately controlled with low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. We compared combinations of therapy, which included the addition of a LABA (salmeterol) to an inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), a step-up to double to quintuple the dose of fluticasone, or both. The treatments were compared with the use of a composite measure that evaluated asthma exacerbations, asthma-control days, and lung function; data were stratified according to genotypic African ancestry. RESULTS: When quintupling the dose of fluticasone (to 250 ?g twice a day) was compared with adding salmeterol (50 ?g twice a day) and doubling the fluticasone (to 100 ?g twice a day), a superior response occurred in 46% of the children with quintupling the fluticasone and in 46% of the children with doubling the fluticasone and adding salmeterol (P?=?0.99). In contrast, more adolescents and adults had a superior response to added salmeterol than to an increase in fluticasone (salmeterol-low-dose fluticasone vs. medium-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 28% [P?=?0.003]; salmeterol-medium-dose fluticasone vs. high-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 31% [P?=?0.02]). Neither the degree of African ancestry nor baseline biomarkers predicted a superior response to specific treatments. The increased dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was associated with a decrease in the ratio of urinary cortisol to creatinine in children younger than 8 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to black adolescents and adults, almost half the black children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to the addition of a LABA.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 7213 patients with an acute coronary syndrome for whom PCI was anticipated to receive either bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin. Patients in the bivalirudin group were subsequently randomly assigned to receive or not to receive a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion. Primary outcomes for the comparison between bivalirudin and heparin were the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and net adverse clinical events (a composite of major bleeding or a major adverse cardiovascular event). The primary outcome for the comparison of a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion with no post-PCI infusion was a composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events. RESULTS: The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with heparin (10.3% and 10.9%, respectively; relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.09; P=0.44), nor was the rate of net adverse clinical events (11.2% and 12.4%, respectively; relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.03; P=0.12). Post-PCI bivalirudin infusion, as compared with no infusion, did not significantly decrease the rate of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events (11.0% and 11.9%, respectively; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an acute coronary syndrome, the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and net adverse clinical events were not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with unfractionated heparin.

Validation of oral 64copper with copper balance,"The efficacy of zinc as a therapeutic agent to control copper balance in Wilson's disease patients has been previously documented with balance studies. In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool for evaluating the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the uptake into blood of a small oral dose of 64copper was studied in conjunction with copper balance. The mean peak 64copper uptake into blood of nine Wilson's disease patients on D-penicillamine, trien, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable with normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment.

An open, randomized study comprised of 40 healthy, early postmenopausal women. During 1 year the concentration of total cholesterol decreased 5.0% in the LNg-IUD group and 10.6% in the oral therapy group; HDL cholesterol decreased 10.9% and 12.8%, respectively, and HDL2 cholesterol decreased 18.1% and 26.9%, respectively. LDL cholesterol values did not change in the LNg-IUD group, whereas a 10.3% decrease was observed in the oral therapy group. Triglyceride values did not change in either group. There were no significant differences in the serum lipoprotein changes between the groups during the treatment. The use of a non-oral regimen of hormone replacement therapy has been advocated to minimize the effect of steroids on the liver. Its effects on the serum pattern of lipids and lipoproteins, however, did not differ significantly from those induced by a continuous oral treatment regimen. ",0

13955,13955,26784217,Chronic Arsenic Poisoning Probably Caused by Arsenic-Based Pesticides: Findings from an Investigation Study of a Household,"In addition to naturally occurring arsenic, man-made arsenic-based compounds are other sources of arsenic exposure. In 2013, our group identified 12 suspected arsenicosis patients in a household (32 living members). Of them, eight members were diagnosed with skin cancer. Interestingly, all of these patients had lived in the household prior to 1989. An investigation revealed that approximately 2 tons of arsenic-based pesticides had been previously placed near a well that had supplied drinking water to the family from 1973 to 1989. The current arsenic level in the well water was 620 mug/L. No other high arsenic wells were found near the family's residence. Based on these findings, it is possible to infer that the skin lesions exhibited by these family members were caused by long-term exposure to well water contaminated with arsenic-based pesticides. Additionally, biochemical analysis showed that the individuals exposed to arsenic had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase than those who were not exposed. These findings might indicate the presence of liver dysfunction in the arsenic-exposed individuals. This report elucidates the effects of arsenical compounds on the occurrence of high levels of arsenic in the environment and emphasizes the severe human health impact of arsenic exposure.",1

Currently, patients with Hodgkin's disease are treated according to the stage and symptoms of their disease. The degree of certainty necessary for determining stage depends on the potential effectiveness of the therapeutic options available in a given case. Certain cases have been identified where treatment with a single modality has been disappointing, and the use of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be considered for these. Such decisions can be made only by evaluating the effectiveness of salvage after relapse following single-modality treatment and assessing the added hazards of initial treatment with both modalities.",0
12818,12818,22834474,Safety evaluation of lubiprostone in the treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome,"INTRODUCTION: Lubiprostone is approved in the United States for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). Lubiprostone causes secretion of fluid and electrolytes in the small bowel, through the activation of chloride channels, and thereby induces laxation and improvement of bowel functions. It is generally considered to be safe and effective. Common side effects of lubiprostone include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating, and the rare side effect dyspnea. Likely mechanisms for these side effects may be related to lubiprostone's primary action on small bowel secretion and the associated intestinal distension, as well as smooth muscle contraction. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of lubiprostone, with particular relevance to the two FDA-approved dosages. EXPERT OPINION: Lubiprostone acts topically in the gut lumen and is almost completely metabolized in the gut lumen. Lubiprostone's M3 metabolite can be detected in low concentrations in the serum and may be responsible for some of its side effects. However, the exact mechanisms by which the side effects are produced are currently unknown.",1
5671,5671,25587040,Role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in adult patients with Ph-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Because a pediatric-inspired Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) protocol yielded a markedly improved outcome in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL, we aimed to reassess the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients treated in the GRAALL-2003 and GRAALL-2005 trials. In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%, 15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥10(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion (hazard ratio, 0.42). This article shows that poor early MRD response, in contrast to conventional ALL risk factors, is an excellent tool to identify patients who may benefit from allogeneic SCT in the context of intensified adult ALL therapy. Trial GRAALL-2003 was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00222027; GRAALL-2005 was registered as #NCT00327678.  ",0
815,815,2785478,Cirrhotics with variceal hemorrhage: the importance of the time interval between admission and the start of analysis for survival and rebleeding rates,"The importance of variable time of entry for analysis of survival following variceal bleeding has recently been disputed. In a study of 194 cirrhotic patients with bleeding esophageal varices in whom 2-day mortality was 3%, statistically significant differences in both survival and rebleeding rates were obtained by shifting the starting point for analysis of survival by 2 weeks following admission to hospital or by 5 days for the analysis of rebleeding. In addition, the curve of hazard function for death or for failure to control bleeding following admission clearly showed that any change in entry time in a study of variceal bleeding would introduce bias and alter survival or rebleeding rates. Thus, the starting point for analysis following variceal hemorrhage is an important confounding variable when calculating both survival and rebleeding. It should always be taken into account, particularly in clinical trials, which are often performed in centers where patients are referred from other hospitals at different times following bleeding.",0
3762,3762,18972442,Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in hemodialysis patients,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is especially problematic in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are undergoing hemodialysis. Rates of HCV infection are higher among hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and several routes of transmission are thought to stem from the dialysis unit. Management of chronic hepatitis C is also more complicated in hemodialysis patients because of altered pharmacokinetics and a predisposition for drug-related toxicity, particularly ribavirin-induced anemia. Clinical trials of patients with chronic hepatitis C and healthy, functioning kidney grafts are rare because of the inherent dangers of graft rejection. As a result, most studies in patients with ESRD have focused on patients waiting for a kidney transplant. Additionally, because ribavirin is contraindicated in this patient population, many studies have examined monotherapy treatments. According to meta-analyses, conventional interferon alfa treatment yields a sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 37%, whereas studies of pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy have yielded SVR rates between 13% and 75%. Several small studies have also used the monitoring of ribavirin plasma concentrations or hemoglobin levels to facilitate the use of combination therapy. In light of the results from these clinical trials, we herein review treatment guidelines and recommend strategies to help optimize the treatment of patients with ESRD. CONCLUSION: There remains a lack of clarity surrounding the most effective treatment options for patients with chronic hepatitis C and ESRD. Treatment can be effective with many patients attaining SVR; however, unfavorable tolerability with interferon alfa-based therapy remains a concern and thus close supportive care should be aggressively pursued to help maintain adherence.",0

Human CE is a serious life-threatening neglected zoonotic disease that occurs in both developing and developed countries, and is recognized as a major public health problem. The life cycle of E. granulosus involves a definitive host (dogs and other canids) for the adult E. granulosus that resides in the intestine, and an intermediate host (sheep and other herbivores) for the tissue-invading metacestode (larval) stage. Humans are only incidentally infected; since the completion of the life cycle of E. granulosus depends on carnivores feeding on herbivores bearing hydatid cysts with viable protoscoleces, humans represent usually the dead end for the parasite. On ingestion of E. granulosus eggs, hydatid cysts are formed mostly in liver and lungs, and occasionally in other organs of human body, which are considered as uncommon sites of localization of hydatid cysts. The diagnosis of extrahepatic echinococcal disease is more accurate today because of the availability of new imaging techniques, and the current treatments include surgery and percutaneous drainage, and chemotherapy (albendazole and mebendazole). But, the wild animals that involve in sylvatic cycle may overlap and interact with the domestic sheep-dog cycle, and thus complicating the control efforts. The updated facts and phenomena regarding human and animal CE presented herein are due to the web search of SCI and non-SCI journals.""",1

We here present an update of our single-center experience with fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen. Fifty-eight patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent RIC and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor (MRD; n=25) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD; n=33). Forty-eight (83%) had undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation. Disease status at transplant was refractory relapse (n=28) or sensitive relapse (n=30). Cumulative day 100 and 2-year transplant-related mortality rates were 7% and 15%, respectively (day 100 transplant-related mortality MRD vs. MUD 8% vs. 6%, p=ns; 2-year MRD vs. MUD 13% vs. 16%, p=ns). The cumulative incidence of acute (grade II-IV) graft-versus-host disease in the first 100 days was 28% (MRD vs. MUD 12% vs. 39%, p=0.04). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease at any time was 73% (MRD vs. MUD 57% vs. 85%, p=0.006). Projected 2-year overall and progression-free survival rates are 64% (49-76%) and 32% (20-45%), with 2-year disease progression/relapse at 55% (43-70%). There was no statistically significant differences in overall survival progression-free survival, and disease progression/relapse between MRD and MUD transplants. There was a trend for the response status pretransplant to have a favorable impact on progression-free survival (p=0.07) and disease progression/relapse (p=0.049), but not on overall survival (p=0.4) Fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen for reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation in progression-free survival Hodgkin's lymphoma is associated with a significant reduction in transplant-related mortality, with comparable results in MRD and MUD allografts. Optimizing pretransplant response status may improve patients' outcome. ",0
333,333,1357554,A comparison of salmeterol with albuterol in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma,"BACKGROUND: An effective, long-acting bronchodilator could benefit patients with asthma who have symptoms not controlled by antiinflammatory drugs. We compared a new long-acting, inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol, with a short-acting beta 2-agonist, albuterol, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 234 patients (150 male and 84 female patients 12 to 73 years old) to one of three treatment groups: one group received 42 micrograms of salmeterol twice daily, one received 180 micrograms of albuterol four times daily, and one received placebo. Treatment was assigned in a double-blind fashion, and all patients could use supplemental inhaled albuterol as needed during the 12-week treatment period. RESULTS: Measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second, performed hourly for 12 consecutive hours, showed that a single dose of salmeterol produced a greater mean area under the curve than two doses of albuterol taken 6 hours apart (6.3 vs. 4.9 liter.hr, P < 0.05). The difference was significant on day 1 and at week 4 of the study, but not at week 8 or 12. Salmeterol was also more effective than albuterol or placebo (with albuterol taken as needed) in increasing the morning peak expiratory flow rate: salmeterol induced a mean increase of 24 liters per minute over the pretreatment values, as compared with a decrease of 6 liters per minute with albuterol (P < 0.001) and an increase of 1 liter per minute with placebo (P = 0.002). The mean overall symptom score was improved most by salmeterol treatment (P < 0.05), with the number of days with symptoms and of nights with awakenings decreasing by 22 percent and 52 percent, respectively; there were no differences in results between albuterol treatment and placebo administration. We found no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilating effects of salmeterol, and adverse reactions to all the treatments were infrequent and mild. CONCLUSIONS: For the management of mild-to-moderate asthma, salmeterol given twice daily is superior to albuterol given either four times daily or as needed.",0

3513,3513,18226316,Safety of a modification of the triage level for febrile children 6 to 36 months old using the Paediatric Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale,"""The Paediatric Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (PaedCTAS) stipulates that febrile patients who are 3 to 36 months old should be triaged to the PaedCTAS 3 """"urgent"""" category. To optimize resource use, we implemented a protocol enabling these children to be down-triaged to the PaedCTAS 4 """"less urgent"""" category if there was no sign of toxicity. Our objective was to evaluate the safety of this triage protocol modification. This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients triaged in an urban tertiary pediatric hospital during a 6-month period between November 22, 2005, and May 22, 2006. Data were retrieved from the emergency department (ED) database and rates of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were compared for 4 groups: all patients triaged as urgent (level 3), all febrile patients from 3 to 36 months old triaged as urgent (level 3), all patients triaged as less urgent (level 4) and all febrile patients aged 3 to 36 months old who were down-triaged to less urgent (level 4). There were 36,285 total ED visits during the study period, including 3477 febrile children who were 3 to 36 months old. Nurses down-triaged 1869 febrile children (54%) to the level-4 (less urgent) category and left 1322 (38%) in the level-3 (urgent) category. Hospitalization rate for down-triaged febrile patients was similar to that seen for all PaedCTAS 4 patients (2.4% v. 2.8%, 95% confidence interval for difference -0.3% to 1.1%). Down-triaged patients had significantly lower admission rates than those remaining in the level-3 (urgent) category (absolute risk reduction 10.7% standard deviation 1.9%, p<0.001). No down-triaged patient died or required ICU admission. Febrile children aged 6 to 36 months who have no signs of toxicity can safely be down-triaged, based on triage nurse clinical judgement, to the less urgent PaedCTAS 4 category. This modification would affect the triage level of approximately 5% of all pediatric ED visits. """,0
2477,2477,11519219,Combined intralesional interferon alpha 2B and oral vitamin E in the treatment of Peyronie's disease,"It has been recently reported that intralesional therapy with alpha interferon 2B resulted in significant improvement of both objective and subjective complaints (penile curvature, pain, plaque size, sexual function) associated with Peyronie's disease. Vitamin E, with its antioxidant properties, may play a role in reducing the inflammatory response. This study was designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of a high dose of alpha INF-2B injected weekly into the Peyronie's plaque combined with oral Vitamin E therapy. Twenty-nine patients with Peyronie's disease were evaluated with penile duplex Doppler for degree of penile curvature, deformity, and plaque size both prior to and after treatment. Each patient then received 4.0 x 10(6) units of alpha INF-2B in 10 cc of normal saline after appropriate local anesthesia. Injections were given once per week directly into the Peyronie's plaque for a period of 10 weeks. Patients also received 400 units of Vitamin E by mouth twice a day. Subjective data was obtained via a questionnaire prior to and at the conclusion of the study. Preliminary results demonstrated improvement of penile curvature in 39% of patients, with one patient experiencing complete resolution. Significant decreases in plaque sizes were noted in 11 of these patients, with softening of the plaques noted in all patients completing the study. Seven patients dropped out of the study prior to completing the 10 weeks: three with severe disease proceeded to surgery, two were lost to follow-up, one had exascerbation of his arthritis symptoms, and one quit secondary to flu-like symptoms. Subjective data from questionnaires revealed improvement in sexual function in those men with decreased curvature and plaque size. Weekly intralesional injections with 4.0 x 10(6) units improved plaque consistency and decreased curvature and plaque size (P < 0.5). Overall subjective sexual performance was reportedly improved. Increased dosage of alpha INF-2B resulted in increased severity of flu-like symptoms when compared to the lower (1 x 10(6) units) biweekly dosage. No significant difference was noted with the addition of oral Vitamin E therapy. ",0

Ten men with gonadotrophin deficiency requiring induction of spermatogenesis and fertility were treated with HCG for 3-6 months followed by the s.c. self-administration of injections of r-hFSH in combination with HCG for 18 months. Among the eight men who commenced r-hFSH treatment, seven demonstrated sperm output at a median of 6 months and five achieved the target sperm output of 1. 5x10(6) per ml at a median of 9 months of FSH treatment. Mean testicular volume increased by 4.2 ml during FSH treatment. Three men produced pregnancies in their partners, two of which resulted in the birth of healthy babies and a third patient's partner had a miscarriage. We conclude that r-hFSH is well tolerated and effective in inducing testis growth, spermatogenesis and fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men. The efficacy of r-hFSH seems comparable with urinary FSH at restoring normal fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men.",1

Treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-MN) plus propranolol achieves a greater reduction in portal pressure than propranolol alone. The present multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated whether combined drug therapy could be more effective than propranolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding. A total of 349 consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices were randomized to receive propranolol + placebo (n = 174) or propranolol + IS-MN (n = 175). There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups (propranolol + placebo, 8.3% and 10.6%; propranolol + IS-MN, 5% and 12.5%). The only independent predictor of variceal bleeding was a variceal size greater than 5 mm. However, among patients with varices greater than 5 mm (n = 196), there were no significant differences in the incidence of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups. Survival was also similar. Adverse effects were significantly more frequent in the propranolol + IS-MN group due to a greater incidence of headache. There were no significant differences in the incidence of new-onset or worsening ascites or in impairment of renal function. In conclusion, propranolol effectively prevents variceal bleeding. Adding IS-MN does not further decrease the low residual risk of bleeding in patients receiving propranolol. However, the long-term use of this combination drug therapy is safe and may be an alternative in clinical conditions associated with a greater risk of bleeding.",0

10721,10721,15500418,Risks of testosterone replacement therapy in ageing men,"Testosterone has been available to practitioners for several decades. However, testosterone prescriptions have increased in recent years partly because of the introduction of newer delivery systems that are topical and have good bioavailability. In the US alone, approximately 2 million prescriptions for testosterone were written in 2002. This represents a 30% increase from 2001 and a 170% increase from 1999. There has also been a 500% increase in prescription sales in the past 10 years. The rise in prescriptions may be in part due to the increasing recognition of hypogonadism in ageing males or andropause. Treatment relating to hypogonadism has relieved symptoms and improved the quality of life of many individuals. Epidemiological studies point toward an association with increased morbidity and mortality, with low testosterone states in ageing males. For example, there is a higher prevalence of depression, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, fracture rates, frailty and even dementia with low testosterone states. Recently, there have been some concerns raised regarding the long-term safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) from the Institute of Medicine. Current evidence suggests no causal relationship between prostate cancer and physiological dosing of testosterone, especially with careful selection and monitoring of patients. Cardiovascular risks have, overall, been neutral, although suggestions have been made that there are positive vasodilatory properties with testosterone. Mild eythrocytosis can be a common side effect of TRT, but thromboembolic events have rarely been reported in the literature. This paper addresses the evidence to date regarding the safety aspects of TRT. The medical-legal implications of TRT for men at this point in time is also discussed.",1

Forty-six patients, divided into two treatment groups, received postoperative continuous epidural infusion of morphine, or that of a combination of bupivacaine and morphine. Assessments were made with the following indices: pain relief score, somnolence score, patient ventilator coordination score, and the number of supplemental administrations of analgesics and sedatives. No significant differences occurred in somnolence scores or patient ventilator coordination scores between the two groups, which revealed satisfactory sedation for mechanical ventilation. Patients receiving the combination of bupivacaine and morphine had significantly less pain postoperatively, requiring a smaller number of supplemental administrations of analgesics and sedatives ( P < 0.05). It is concluded that: 1) continuous epidural infusion of analgesics gives potent analgesia and sedation of ventilated patients following esophagectomy; 2) the combination of bupivacaine and morphine gives pain relief superior to morphine alone.

METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label trial conducted in Japan, we randomly assigned 2236 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban (a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant) or combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause; this end point was analyzed for noninferiority with a noninferiority margin of 1.46. The primary safety end point was major bleeding, according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; this end point was analyzed for superiority. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination-therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for the primary efficacy end point, with event rates of 4.14% and 5.75% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety end point, with event rates of 1.62% and 2.76% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.89; P?=?0.01 for superiority).

We conducted a nested case-control analysis within this cohort in which each patient with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation was matched with up to 25 control subjects from the cohort, according to age, sex, and year of entry into the cohort. Incidence-rate ratios for cardiac-valve regurgitation with the use of different dopamine agonists were estimated by conditional logistic-regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 31 case patients with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation, 6 were currently exposed to pergolide, 6 were currently exposed to cabergoline, and 19 had not been exposed to any dopamine agonist within the previous year. The rate of cardiac-valve regurgitation was increased with current use of pergolide (incidence-rate ratio, 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 22.3) and cabergoline (incidence-rate ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 15.6), but not with current use of other dopamine agonists. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, use of the dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline was associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation.",0
8910,8910,7734010,Effect of lovastatin on early carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS) Research Group,"""BACKGROUND: HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins), a new class of lipid-lowering compounds, have raised expectations for more widespread use than that of the older lipid-lowering drugs. Not only are they more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, but they are better tolerated as well. No data exist concerning the effect of statins on early carotid atherosclerosis and clinical events in men and women who have moderately elevated LDL cholesterol levels but are free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lovastatin (20 to 40 mg/d) or its placebo was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with factorial design along with warfarin (1 mg/d) or its placebo. This report is limited to the lovastatin component of the trial. Daily aspirin (81 mg/d) was recommended for everyone. Enrollment included 919 asymptomatic men and women, 40 to 79 years old, with early carotid atherosclerosis as defined by B-mode ultrasonography and LDL cholesterol between the 60th and 90th percentiles. The 3-year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in 12 walls of the carotid arteries was the primary outcome; change in single maximum IMT and incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary outcomes. LDL cholesterol fell 28%, from 156.6 mg/dL at baseline to 113.1 mg/dL at 6 months (P < .0001), in the lovastatin groups and was largely unchanged in the lovastatin-placebo groups. Among participants not on warfarin, regression of the mean maximum IMT was seen after 12 months in the lovastatin group compared with the placebo group; the 3-year difference was statistically significant (P = .001). A larger favorable effect of lovastatin was observed for the change in single maximum IMT but was not statistically significant (P = .12). Five lovastatin-treated participants suffered major cardiovascular events--coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--versus 14 in the lovastatin-placebo groups (P = .04). One lovastatin-treated participant died, compared with eight on lovastatin-placebo (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In men and women with moderately elevated LDL cholesterol, lovastatin reverses progression of IMT in the carotid arteries and appears to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and mortality. Results from ongoing large-scale clinical trials may further establish the clinical benefit of statins.""",1
1199,1199,6276746,Effect of the fluoride/calcium regimen on vertebral fracture occurrence in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Comparison with conventional therapy,"We assessed the rates of vertebral fracture in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Forty-five patients were not treated (91 person-years of observation); 59 were treated conventionally, with calcium (alone or combined with estrogen) or vitamin D or both (218 years); and 61 were treated with sodium fluoride combined with conventional therapy (251 years). The fracture rate (per thousand person-years) was 834 in untreated patients, 419 in those given calcium with or without vitamin D, 304 in those given fluoride and calcium with or without vitamin D, 181 in those given estrogen and calcium with or without vitamin D, and 53 in those given fluoride, estrogen, and calcium with or without vitamin D. It was reduced in all treatment groups (P less than 0.001 for calcium and P less than 1 x 10(-6) for other combinations); fluoride (one years of treatment) and estrogen (but not vitamin D) independently reduced the rate from that observed with calcium alone (P less than 0.001). The combination of calcium fluoride, and estrogen was more effective than any other combination (P less than 0.001). These results provide grounds for optimism about the efficacy of combinations of available agents with sodium fluoride for fracture in postmenopausal osteoporosis.",0

2961,2961,15791608,Impact of hepatitis C on health related quality of life: a systematic review and quantitative assessment,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diminishes health related quality of life (HRQOL), and it is now common to measure HRQOL in clinical trials. We sought to summarize the HRQOL data in HCV, and to establish the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in HRQOL scores in HCV. We performed a systematic review to identify relevant studies, and converted HRQOL data from each study into clinically interpretable statistics. An expert panel used a modified Delphi technique to estimate the MCID in HCV. We found that patients with HCV scored lower than controls across all scales of the SF-36. Patients achieving sustained virological response (SVR) scored higher across all scales versus patients without SVR, especially in the physical health domains. HRQOL differences did not correspond with differences in liver histology or ALT levels. Based upon the published data, the expert panel concluded that the SF-36 vitality scale was most relevant in patients with HCV, and generated a mean MCID of 4.2 points on this scale. In conclusion, patients with HCV have a clinically significant decrement in HRQOL versus controls, and physical HRQOL improves in patients achieving SVR but not in those without SVR. The data further suggest that traditional outcomes fail to capture the full spectrum of illness related to chronic HCV. A difference of 4.2 points on the SF-36 vitality scale can be used as an estimate of the MCID in HCV, and this value may be used as the basis for power calculations in clinical trials evaluating HRQOL.

3534,3534,18318762,Outcome of BEAM-autologous and BEAM-alemtuzumab allogeneic transplantation in relapsed advanced stage follicular lymphoma,"The role of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in relapsed follicular lymphoma remains controversial. This study analysed 126 patients with relapsed, advanced stage follicular lymphoma who received BEAM (BCNU [carmustine], cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan)-alemtuzumab allogeneic HSCT (BEAM-allo) (n = 44) or BEAM-autologous HSCT (BEAM-auto) (n = 82). The BEAM-allo group had a younger median age (48 years vs. 56 years, P < 0.001) but received a higher median number of therapies pretransplant (P = 0.015) compared with the BEAM-auto group. There was a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in the BEAM-allo group compared with the BEAM-auto group at 1 year (20% vs. 2%, P = 0.001). Older age and heavily pretreated patients were associated with a higher NRM and poorer survival in the BEAM-allo group. There was, however, a significantly lower relapse rate (20% vs. 43%, P = 0.01) at 3 years with BEAM-alemtuzumab, with no relapses after 2 years, compared with a continued pattern of relapse in the autologous group. No difference in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.99) or disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.90) was identified at 3 years, whereas a plateau in OS and DFS with crossing of the survival curves in favour of BEAM-allo group was observed. Furthermore, the ability to re-induce remissions with donor leucocytes provides additional benefit in favour of allogeneic HSCT. ",0
3974,3974,19575366,Individualized treatment strategy according to early viral kinetics in hepatitis C virus type 1-infected patients,"Individualized treatment on the basis of early viral kinetics has been discussed to optimize antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Individually tailored reduction in treatment duration in HCV type 1-infected patients represents one possible strategy. Four hundred thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5 microg/kg peginterferon alfa-2b weekly plus 800-1,400 mg ribavirin daily for 48 weeks (n = 225, group A) or an individually tailored treatment duration (18-48 weeks; n = 208, group B). In the latter group, treatment duration was calculated using the time required to induce HCV RNA negativity (branched DNA [bDNA] assay; sensitivity limit, 615 IU/mL) multiplied by the factor 6. All bDNA negative samples were retested with the more sensitive transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay (sensitivity limit, 5.3 IU/mL). Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were significantly lower in group B (34.6% versus 48.0% [P = 0.005]) due to higher relapse rates (32.7% versus 14.2% [P< 0.0005]). Important predictors of response were the levels of baseline viremia as well as the time to TMA negativity on treatment. Taking the simultaneous presence of low baseline viral load (<800,000 IU/mL) and a negative TMA test within the first 4 weeks as predictors for treatment response, SVR rates were comparable between both treatment schedules with an SVR probability of >80% obtained in patients treated for only 18 or 24 weeks. CONCLUSION: The individualized treatment strategy according to time to bDNA negativity failed to provide comparable efficacy compared with the standard of care. The inferiority of the individualized protocol may be explained by the use of a less sensitive HCV RNA assay, and also by underestimation of the importance of baseline viremia.",0
8131,8131,4061998,Gastrotomy--a surgical approach to iron overdose,"""Emesis and lavage often are ineffective in providing complete emptying of the stomach after an ingestion. With a locally corrosive and systemically toxic agent such as iron, surgical intervention with emergency gastrotomy may be required. We recently treated a 19-year-old man in the ED and in the departments of surgery and medicine who required a gastrotomy to remove a large amount of elemental iron inaccessible to removal by emesis, lavage, or gastroscopy. At gastrotomy the stomach showed full-thickness inflammation; the entire mucosal surface was hemorrhagic in nature. Gastrotomy was successful in allowing the removal of a large amount of the retained corrosive material. The severity of the findings at gastrotomy and the dramatic clinical improvement and recovery in our patient strongly support this approach if traditional methods fail.""",1

Although the former was associated with significantly less bleeding within the first 24 hr of injection (p less than 0.05) but more postinjection pain (p less than 0.05) and esophageal stricture, there was a trend toward earlier obliteration of varices. This was most marked over the first three courses of injection, and although frequency of rebleeding was not significantly less, none of the 11 episodes in the sheath group were fatal, compared to 5 of 15 bleeds in those injected by the free-hand technique (p less than 0.05).",0
10270,10270,12691611,Liver failure caused by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase plus ganciclovir therapy is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA depletion,"Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) converts ganciclovir (GCV) into an active compound, which can be incorporated into DNA molecules and terminate DNA synthesis. Gene transfer of HSV-tk followed by GCV administration has been used with success to treat experimental cancer and this strategy has entered into clinical trials. Although it is thought that the cytotoxic effect occurs mainly in tumoral dividing cells, where mitotic activity favors integration of the genotoxic compound into nuclear DNA, there are concerns of potential damage to normal nondividing cells. In the present work we have explored the mechanisms of HSV-tk/GCV toxicity and in particular whether this therapy may cause lesions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the administration of GCV to rats injected with adenovirus encoding HSV-tk induced hepatocellular damage characterized by the presence of apoptotic bodies, ballooning of hepatocytes, and severe hepatic steatosis with mitochondria enlargement and cristae dissolution at the ultrastructural level. Remarkably, Southern blot analysis showed substantial reduction in the amount of mtDNA in the liver. Using radiolabeled GCV we could demonstrate incorporation of this compound into both nuclear and mtDNA in HSV-tk-transduced rat hepatocytic cell line MCA-RH7777 and subsequent alteration of mitochondrial function. Our observations confirm that GCV can damage both nuclear and mtDNA in cells transduced with HSV-tk and that this effect could be responsible for severe mitochondrial dysfunction and toxicity in normal nondividing cells. These data are relevant for the design of clinical trials using adenoviral vectors encoding HSV-tk.",1
4779,4779,24047455,Effects of bracing in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis,"BACKGROUND: The role of bracing in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who are at risk for curve progression and eventual surgery is controversial. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter study that included patients with typical indications for bracing due to their age, skeletal immaturity, and degree of scoliosis. Both a randomized cohort and a preference cohort were enrolled. Of 242 patients included in the analysis, 116 were randomly assigned to bracing or observation, and 126 chose between bracing and observation. Patients in the bracing group were instructed to wear the brace at least 18 hours per day. The primary outcomes were curve progression to 50 degrees or more (treatment failure) and skeletal maturity without this degree of curve progression (treatment success). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early owing to the efficacy of bracing. In an analysis that included both the randomized and preference cohorts, the rate of treatment success was 72% after bracing, as compared with 48% after observation (propensity-score-adjusted odds ratio for treatment success, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 3.46). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of treatment success was 75% among patients randomly assigned to bracing, as compared with 42% among those randomly assigned to observation (odds ratio, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.85 to 9.16). There was a significant positive association between hours of brace wear and rate of treatment success (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bracing significantly decreased the progression of high-risk curves to the threshold for surgery in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The benefit increased with longer hours of brace wear.

A total of 29 weight loss compounds, including sennoside, sibutramine, ephedrine and their analogues, found to be adulterated in foods and dietary supplements were simultaneously examined by LC-MS/MS. The 188 samples were collected between 2009 and 2012 in South Korea, and method validation was performed to determine the adulterants to the weight loss compounds. LODs, LOQs and linearity ranged from 0.03 to 7.5 ng ml??, from 0.08 to 30.00 ng ml??, and from 0.990 to 0.999, respectively. The results showed that nine weight loss compounds, namely bisacodyl, desmethylsibutramine, didesmethylsibutramine, ephedrine, fluoxetine, pseudoephedrine, sennoside A, sennoside B and sibutramine, were detected in 62 of all collected samples and were found in order of frequency as follows: sibutramine, 25.7%; sennoside A, 22.9%; sennoside B, 20.0%; fluoxetine, 8.6%; desmethylsibutramine, 7.1%; bisacodyl, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine, 4.3%; and didesmethylsibutramine, 2.9%.

12561,12561,22030947,"Effects of 1,3-dimethylamylamine and caffeine alone or in combination on heart rate and blood pressure in healthy men and women","BACKGROUND: The use of 1,3-dimethylamylamine (geranamine), alone and in combination with caffeine, is becoming widespread within the dietary supplement industry. To our knowledge, no data are available concerning the effects of oral geranamine intake on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure in individuals. METHODS: Ten young healthy men and women ingested 1 of 5 conditions on different days using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. The following were ingested after a 10-hour overnight fast: 250 mg caffeine (C), 50 mg geranamine (G 50 mg), 75 mg geranamine (G 75 mg), 250 mg caffeine + 50 mg geranamine (C + G 50 mg), and 250 mg caffeine + 75 mg geranamine (C + G 75 mg). Heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were measured pre-ingestion and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) were measured pre-ingestion and at 60 and 120 minutes post-ingestion. RESULTS: Heart rate was unaffected by treatment, but blood pressure and RPP were higher with geranamine, generally in a dose-dependent manner. The peak percent change from pre-ingestion in SBP (~20%), DBP (~17%), and RPP (~9%) was noted with C + G 75 mg at 60 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma NE and EPI were relatively unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that acute ingestion of 1,3-dimethylamylamine alone and in combination with caffeine results in an increase in SBP, DBP, and RPP without an increase in HR. The largest increase is observed at 60 minutes post-ingestion of C + G 75 mg. These changes cannot be explained by circulating NE and EPI.",1
2723,2723,15058525,Infliximab: lack of efficacy on perforating complications in Crohn's disease,"Infliximab (Remicade), a chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), has emerged as promising therapeutic option in perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD). However, little knowledge exists about its use for the treatment of internal fistulas in CD. We present our experience with infliximab in this situation. Four patients with CD who had internal fistulas (Case 1: entero-enteral and entero-abdominal; Case 2: entero-enteral; Case 3: entero-enteral and parastomal; Case 4: entero-vesical) were treated with 3 infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight) with intervals of 2 and 4 weeks. In addition, 3 patients had strictures and 2 patients had perianal fistulas. After the three infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight), internal fistulas remained unchanged in all patients. The perianal fistulas present in 2 cases were healed. Administration of infliximab was safe and well tolerated in all cases. Treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight) led to healing of only the perianal fistulas, whereas the internal fistulas were not influenced. We conclude that in these 4 cases, infliximab was well tolerated but not effective for the management of internal fistulas and was no alternative for surgery. ",0

Thus, the majority of FPHL patients remain untreated. Previously, we demonstrated that nonresponders to 5% minoxidil have low metabolism of minoxidil in hair follicles. As such, we hypothesized that increasing the dosage of topical minoxidil to low metabolizers would increase the number of responders without increasing the incidence of adverse events. In this study, we recruited FPHL subjects that were identified as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil utilizing the previously validated assay for minoxidil response. Subjects were treated for 12 weeks with a novel 15% topical minoxidil solution. At 12 weeks, 60% of subjects achieved a clinically significant response based on target area hair counts (>13.7% from baseline), as well as significant improvement in global photographic assessment. None of the subjects experienced significant hemodynamic changes or any other adverse events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potentially beneficial effect of a higher dosage of minoxidil in FPHL subjects who fail to respond to 5% minoxidil. ",0
2571,2571,12407597,Alcohol use and hepatitis C,"Excess alcohol consumption can worsen the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis C. It is important to distinguish between alcohol abuse, which must be treated on its own merits, and the effect of alcohol use on progression, severity, and treatment of hepatitis C. Most studies on the effects of alcohol on hepatitis C have focused on patients with high levels of daily alcohol intake. Indeed, the adverse effects of light and moderate amounts of alcohol intake on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have not been clearly shown, and only limited studies have been performed. Sex differences exist in the effect of alcohol on fibrosis as well as on the severity of hepatitis C. Alcohol use has been reported to be associated with lower responses to therapy and, in some studies, higher HCV RNA levels and increased HCV quasi-species. Few studies address the treatment of hepatitis C in the alcoholic individual or determine the effect of continued light or moderate alcohol use on the outcome of treatment response. In summary, many critical questions remain regarding the interactions between alcohol and hepatitis C. Currently, the evidence from the literature shows that heavy alcohol intake worsens the outcome of HCV infection. The literature is inadequate to provide definitive recommendations regarding the effect of light to moderate alcohol use in patients with hepatitis C.",0

We used logistic-regression models to estimate the relative risks of disease-specific types of chronic renal failure associated with the use of various analgesics RESULTS: Aspirin and acetaminophen were used regularly by 37 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the patients with renal failure and by 19 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of the controls. Regular use of either drug in the absence of the other was associated with an increase by a factor of 2.5 in the risk of chronic renal failure from any cause. The relative risks rose with increasing cumulative lifetime doses, rose more consistently with acetaminophen use than with aspirin use, and were increased for most disease-specific types of chronic renal failure. When we disregarded the recent use of analgesics, which could have occurred in response to antecedents of renal disease, the associations were only slightly attenuated CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the existence of exacerbating effects of acetaminophen and aspirin on chronic renal failure. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of bias due to the triggering of analgesic consumption by predisposing conditions.",0

Relative to baseline, there was a greater relative reduction in time spent crying and colicky crying by the second intervention week (p=0.050) and follow-up period (p=0.031), respectively, in infants receiving either type of acupuncture. More infants receiving acupuncture cried <3 hours/day, and thereby no longer fulfilled criteria for colic, in the first (p=0.040) and second (p=0.006) intervention weeks. No serious adverse events were reported. Acupuncture appears to reduce crying in infants with colic safely. NCT01761331; Results. ",0
10574,10574,14982164,Health and aesthetic impacts of copper corrosion on drinking water,"Traditional research has focused on the visible effects of corrosion--failures, leaks, and financial debits--and often overlooked the more hidden health and aesthetic aspects. Clearly, corrosion of copper pipe can lead to levels of copper in the drinking water that exceed health guidelines and cause bitter or metallic tasting water. Because water will continue to be conveyed to consumers worldwide through metal pipes, the water industry has to consider both the effects of water quality on corrosion and the effects of corrosion on water quality. Integrating four key factors--chemical/biological causes, economics, health and aesthetics--is critical for managing the distribution system to produce safe water that consumers will use with confidence. As technological developments improve copper pipes to minimize scaling and corrosion, it is essential to consider the health and aesthetic effects on an equal plane with chemical/biological causes and economics to produce water that is acceptable for public consumption.",1
3097,3097,16503714,Daptomycin for the treatment of gram-positive bacteremia and infective endocarditis: a retrospective case series of 31 patients,"To evaluate the outcomes in patients with bacteremia and/or infective endocarditis who were treated with daptomycin. Retrospective chart review. A university-affiliated medical center in Chicago, Illinois, and a regional hospital in Fountain Valley, California. Thirty-one inpatients treated with daptomycin for bacteremia and/or infective endocarditis. Patients were given daptomycin 4-6 mg/kg intravenously every 24-48 hours based on the practitioner's discretion and depending on the patient's clinical condition and presence of comorbidities. Primary end points were resolution of signs and symptoms of infection and discharge from the hospital. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ([MRSA] 11 patients) and vancomycin-resistant entercocci ([VRE] 11 patients) were the most common pathogens, whereas 7 patients had methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection and 1 patient had coagulasenegative Staphylococcus infection. One patient with endocarditis had a negative culture result. Overall, 24 (77%) of the 31 patients achieved clinical resolution and were discharged, including all patients infected with MRSA; 7 patients died, 6 of whom had VRE infection. Duration of treatment for infective endocarditis lasted longer (typically 22-43 days) than that for bacteremia only (< or = 14 days), and no patients discontinued daptomycin because of adverse events. In these patients, daptomycin was safe and well tolerated even for extended durations of treatment. Daptomycin may provide an effective option for treating drug-resistant gram-positive bloodstream infections and endocarditis. ",0
861,861,2824623,Leukocyte interferon for treating first episodes of genital herpes in women,"Women experiencing their first episodes of genital herpes were treated, beginning within three days of the onset of lesions, with 5 X 10(4) units of human leukocyte interferon/kg of body weight for 12 doses over 14 days (total, approximately 3.6 X 10(7) units) or with placebo in equivalent volumes. Life-table analysis revealed quicker healing and significant reductions in the duration of shedding of virus in interferon-treated patients. Maximum daily geometric mean titers of virus and total area of unhealed lesions also decreased more quickly. No statistically significant difference in resolution of pain was seen between the two groups. Interferon had no effect on onset or frequency of subsequent recurrences recorded over one year of follow-up. Moderate, transient neutropenia occurred in 13 of 34 interferon-treated patients. A therapeutic effect of human leukocyte interferon on initial genital herpes was documented, but the clinical usefulness of interferon treatment of genital herpes is limited at this time. ",0
974,974,3029592,Chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy in limited small-cell carcinoma of the lung,"""We conducted a prospective, randomized study to clarify the role of radiotherapy of the primary tumor in limited small-cell cancer of the lung. After stratification for sex and for performance score based on the ability to ambulate, patients were randomly assigned to receive initial radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, delayed radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide (VP-16-213), and vincristine, with doxorubicin subsequently replacing etoposide in alternate cycles 7 through 18. Chemotherapy was given every three weeks for 18 months. The radiotherapy comprised 4000 rad in four weeks, followed by a 1000-rad """"boost"""" directed against residual disease. All patients received prophylactic whole-brain radiation. The patients enrolled totaled 426, and 399 were evaluable. There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of complete responses in favor of the two radiotherapy regimens (P = 0.0013). Failure-free survival was also longer with these two regimens (P less than 0.001), as was the interval before treatment failure in the chest (P less than 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.0099). As expected, toxic effects--chiefly neutropenia--were also increased. The addition of radiotherapy of the primary tumor to combination chemotherapy improved both complete-response rates and survival, with increased but acceptable toxicity.""",0
8761,8761,7199426,Epidemiology of hepatic angiosarcoma in the United States: 1964-1974,"""A nationwide survey of hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) in the United States during the years 1964 through 1974 identified 168 cases. Of these, 42 cases (25%) were associated with known etiologic factors, such as vinyl chloride monomer exposure during preparation of poly(vinyl chloride), use of Thorotrast in angiography, exposure to inorganic arsenic, and treatment with androgenic-anabolic steroids; 126 cases (75%) are of uncertain etiology. HAS most often affects males (ratio of approximately 3:1), peaks in the sixth and seventh decades of life (somewhat earlier than other sarcomas of the liver) and appears to occur more often in the industrialized Northeast and Midwest (although reporting artifact may be a factor). There is an extraordinary relative risk for poly(vinyl chloride) polymerization workers; there may also be other chemical-industrial associations that require further investigation. Prospective epidemiologic studies of HAS should be considered as a means of identifying other causative factors (e.g., chemicals or drugs) related to HAS.""",1
6251,6251,28953427,Comparison of Strategies of Treatment with Ranibizumab in Newly-Diagnosed Cases of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"In several case-studies improved outcomes have been reported after switching from a pro-re-nata (PRN)- to a treat-and-extend (T&E)-based therapeutic approach in cases of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). We therefore wished to compare the effects of instigating 2 different protocols in newly-diagnosed nAMD undergoing treatment with Ranibizumab. The outcomes of a PRN- and a T&E-based regime were retrospectively compared in treatment-naïve eyes under therapy with Ranibizumab for minimally 12 months in a routine clinical setting. The primary outcome measures included the proportion of the eyes with intraretinal fluid in OCT and visual stability after the initial drug-loading phase. The comparative case-series included 107 eyes (PRN: 68; T&E: 39). During the 2-year follow-up period, a similar number of clinical examinations were performed in the 2 groups (PRN: 14.0 ± 6.2; T&E 13.4 ± 4.4; P = 0.97), whereas the number of injections that were administered differed for the first (PRN: 5.5 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 6.8 ± 2.4; P = 0.008) and the second year (PRN: 1.9 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 3.8 ± 2.3; P = 0.002). The proportion of eyes with intraretinal fluid after the initial drug-loading phase remained stable (PRN: from 33.8% to 36.4%; T&E: from 25.6% to 29.0%); so, too, did the central retinal thickness and the visual acuity. Despite a limited sample size, this retrospective analysis revealed the anatomical and the functional improvements during the 2-year follow-up period to be not roughly different for the 2 strategies. However, when the PRN-approach is instigated, the risk of under-treatment due to lapses in visits or to over-extensions in the intervals between treatments may be underestimated. ",0

Adjunctive treatment with potent antiplatelet and antithrombin agents increases arterial patency but is associated with excessive bleeding. Cangrelor (formerly AR-C69931MX) is a rapidly acting, specific antagonist of platelet aggregation via binding to the adenosine diphosphate P2Y12 receptor subtype. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and coronary artery patency of cangrelor as an adjunct to alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]). METHODS: Patients with AMI received aspirin, heparin, and an intravenous infusion of either cangrelor alone, full-dose t-PA alone, or 1 of 3 doses of cangrelor along with half-dose t-PA. The primary end point was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 60 minutes. Secondary end points included TIMI frame count, TIMI myocardial perfusion grade, extent of ST-segment resolution, composite clinical events, and bleeding. RESULTS: Ninety-two of planned 180 patients were enrolled. The combination of cangrelor and half-dose t-PA resulted in similar 60-minute patency as full-dose t-PA alone (55% vs 50%, P = not significant) and greater patency than with cangrelor alone (55% vs 18%, P < .05). The percentage of patients achieving >70% ST-segment resolution at 60 minutes tended to be greater with combination therapy than with either cangrelor or t-PA alone (28% vs 13%, P = .13 and 28% vs 14%, P = .30, respectively). Bleeding and adverse clinical events were comparable among the groups. CONCLUSION: This first experience with the intravenous P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, cangrelor, suggests the potential of this compound as an adjunct to fibrinolysis during treatment of AMI.",1

BRAF mutations that constitutively activate MAPK signalling and bypass the need for upstream stimuli occur with high prevalence in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this report we characterize the novel, potent, and selective BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436). Cellular inhibition of BRAF(V600E) kinase activity by dabrafenib resulted in decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation through an initial G1 cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. In a BRAF(V600E)-containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild-type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor-induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor.",1
11275,11275,17488146,Comparative review of the carbapenems,"""The carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad spectrum of activity. Older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) located in renal tubules and required co-administration with a DHP-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. Later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to DHP-1 and are administered without a DHP-1 inhibitor. Like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including AmpC beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Resistance to carbapenems develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their PBPs, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. Imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. As with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC). Imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. The current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. The unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. Doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa than meropenem. Clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including nosocomial infections.""",1
6239,6239,28950807,Durable complete remission following anti-EGFR antibodies in recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer,"In this case report, we describe a patient who remains in complete remission two years after the discontinuation of anti-EGFR monotherapy as a third-line treatment, accompanied by persistent severe hypomagnesemia. A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with mCRC started chemotherapy with weekly cetuximab. After ten months of treatment, the therapy was stopped because the patient had persistent grade III hypomagnesemia despite amiloride, oral, and intravenous magnesium. A month later, the patient was switched to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every two weeks for four additional months to avoid weekly visits to the clinic. Following discontinuation of panitumumab, PET scans remain negative to this day, two years after anti-EGFR therapy discontinuation. No factor has been identified to explain the complete and sustained response experienced by this patient. Hypomagnesemia is a common adverse effect of anti-EGFR therapy that can lead to treatment interruption and discontinuation if severe. This case highlights the importance of pursuing anti-EGFR therapy when a response is observed in spite of severe hypomagnesemia. It also provides preliminary information that anti-EGFR therapy could be stopped after a complete response is obtained. ",0

1564,1564,7760871,New neuromuscular blocking drugs,"The new nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs have specific advantages over succinylcholine. Rocuronium has an onset of action that is almost as rapid as that of succinylcholine and may be useful in patients with residual gastric contents. This drug may replace vecuronium, since the two agents are otherwise similar. The onset of action of mivacurium is similar to that of atracurium, but recovery from the blockade is more rapid (if the plasma cholinesterase level is normal), making mivacurium useful for short procedures. Although pipecuronium and doxacurium have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system, their long and variable onset and duration of action limit their usefulness. The need for either drug is questionable. There is still a need, however, for a nondepolarizing drug that has an onset of action as rapid as that of succinylcholine but a duration of action similar to that of mivacurium, with no adverse cardiovascular effects and clearance from the body that is independent of organ function.",0

Sixty-nine nucleoside-na?ve CHB patients with baseline HBV DNA of 10(8) copies/mL or more were randomized 1:1 to open-label treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day or adefovir 10 mg/day for a minimum of 52 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis compared mean reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 adjusted for baseline levels using linear regression. Entecavir was superior to adefovir for mean change from baseline in HBV DNA at week 12 (-6.23 log(10) copies/mL versus -4.42 log(10) copies/mL, respectively; mean difference -1.58 log(10) copies/mL; P < 0.0001). Both drugs demonstrated biphasic viral kinetics, with a first phase of rapid decline lasting 10 days. A significant difference favoring ETV was reached at day 10 (day 10 ETV-ADV difference estimate: -0.66 log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI [-0.30, -0.01]). Early virological response was found to be predictive of subsequent virological response, with those having lower HBV DNA levels at day 10 being more likely to achieve HBV DNA of less than 300 copies/mL at week 48. In addition, there was considerably less variability in the extent of HBV DNA reductions in patients treated with entecavir versus adefovir. Both the mean decrease in serum HBV DNA and the proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA less than 300 copies/mL were greater in entecavir-treated than adefovir-treated patients at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48. At week 48, one (3%) ETV-treated versus 15 (47%) ADV-treated patients had HBV DNA of 10(5) copies/mL or more. Both antivirals were well tolerated.

3324,3324,17881750,Outcomes at 2 years of age after repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported the results of a randomized, controlled trial showing that repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids reduced the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and serious neonatal morbidity. However, data have not been available regarding longer-term effects of this treatment. METHODS: Women who had received an initial course of corticosteroid treatment 7 or more days previously were randomly assigned to receive an intramuscular injection of corticosteroid (11.4 mg of betamethasone) or saline placebo; the dose was repeated weekly if the mother was still considered to be at risk for preterm delivery and the duration of gestation was less than 32 weeks. We assessed survival free of major neurosensory disability and body size of the children at 2 years of corrected age. RESULTS: Of the 1085 children who were alive at 2 years of age, 1047 (96.5%) were seen for assessment (521 exposed to repeat-corticosteroid treatment and 526 exposed to placebo). The rate of survival free of major disability was similar in the repeat-corticosteroid and placebo groups (84.4% and 81.0%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.10; adjusted P=0.20). There were no significant differences between the groups in body size, blood pressure, use of health services, respiratory morbidity, or child behavior scores, although children exposed to repeat doses of corticosteroids were more likely than those exposed to placebo to warrant assessment for attention problems (P=0.04).

3075,3075,16447260,Therapy of hepatitis B -- viral suppression or eradication?,"The practicing clinician is currently faced with a number of treatment options for chronic hepatitis B. Beginning in 1998 with the licensing of lamivudine and subsequently adefovir, the treatment paradigm shifted from 4 to 6 months of conventional alfa interferon to a year of nucleoside analog therapy. However, prolonged treatment with nucleoside analogs is often needed to optimize virological response. Recently, a 48-week regimen of pegylated interferon for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B has been shown to be effective, and long-term nucleoside analog therapy has been demonstrated to maintain viral suppression. These findings have added to the complexity of decision-making and have raised questions about whether a finite course of pegylated interferon or nucleoside analog therapy, with possible long-term maintenance, is better as first-line therapy. Each of these fundamentally different approaches has advantages and limitations, and both have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium against chronic hepatitis B. Long-term therapy with nucleoside analogs, however, raises a number of practical concerns that have not been fully addressed as of yet. I will present evidence in support of the recommendation that antiviral therapy should ideally be directed toward achieving the highest rate of viral clearance with the shortest interval of treatment.",0

However, randomized-trial evidence that calcium with vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 36,282 postmenopausal women from 40 Women's Health Initiative centers: 18,176 women received 500 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 200 IU of vitamin D3 [corrected] twice daily (1000 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D3) and 18,106 received a matching placebo for an average of 7.0 years. The incidence of pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer was the designated secondary outcome. Baseline levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were assessed in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: The incidence of invasive colorectal cancer did not differ significantly between women assigned to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and those assigned to placebo (168 and 154 cases; hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.34; P=0.51), and the tumor characteristics were similar in the two groups. The frequency of colorectal-cancer screening and abdominal symptoms was similar in the two groups. There were no significant treatment interactions with baseline characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years had no effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women. The long latency associated with the development of colorectal cancer, along with the seven-year duration of the trial, may have contributed to this null finding. Ongoing follow-up will assess the longer-term effect of this intervention. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000611.).",0

Its pathophysiological process is mainly via the competitive inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. Oral carglumic acid (N-carbamylglutamate) administration can correct hyperammonemia in neonates with propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, thus avoiding dialysis therapy. Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive disease of leucine metabolism due to deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. For the first time, we report a neonate with isovaleric acidemia, whose plasma ammonia concentration dropped dramatically after one oral load of carglumic acid.

With the discovery of new genetic defects leading to hypercoagulabiulity an increasing number of patients with serious thrombotic manifestations, such as BCS, will exhibit concurrence of hereditary and acquired risk factors for thrombosis.",1
9174,9174,8667468,"Increased matrix proteins, collagen and transforming growth factor are early markers of hepatotoxicity in patients on long-term methotrexate therapy","BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity, which may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, often limits the use of long-term low dose methotrexate for psoriasis and autoimmune diseases. Standard light microscopy lacks sensitivity for early fibrosis. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of immunohistochemical markers of early fibrosis including laminin and fibronectin, collagen deposition and lipocyte activation in hepatic biopsies of 36 psoriatic patients treated with methotrexate for one to five years, at an average dose of 20 mg/week. Biopsies before initiation of methotrexate (n = 36) showed minimal immunohistochemical expression of desmin, transforming growth factor alpha, matrix proteins, and collagen. Expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens III and IV increased significantly and progressively over baseline values after cumulative doses of 1.5 +/- 0.25 g (n = 20) and 3 +/- 0.5 g methotrexate, respectively. Increases in desmin, smooth muscle actin and collagen type I also occurred but the changes were less consistent. Light microscopic abnormalities of hepatotoxicity were not detectable in any of these biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical quantification of matrix proteins and collagens type III and IV may be early, sensitive and dose responsive markers of methotrexate hepatotoxicity which progress with increasing cumulative doses of methotrexate.",1

4575,4575,23651792,Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy might not increase the risk of haemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis,"The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants increased haemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis. Cases (n = 242) with a history of haemoptysis were compared with controls (n = 242) without a history of haemoptysis. Of the 242 case patients, 16.5% took antiplatelets compared with 19.8% of controls (P = 0.346). The proportion of warfarin users did not differ between cases and controls (3.3% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.588).

3193,3193,16525092,Efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in East Timor,"The efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in East Timor is unknown. We treated 38 individuals with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria with SP and monitored the outcome for 28 days. Recrudescent parasitemia, confirmed by genotyping, were detected in three individuals resulting in a late treatment failure rate of 7.9% (95% confidence interval = 1.7-21.4%). The results suggest that SP is still efficacious in treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in East Timor. However, the useful life of SP in East Timor may be limited because 80% of the parasites in our samples were found to already carry double mutations in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (S108N/C59R). The data from this study also highlights that the presence of gametocytes may significantly influence the estimate of SP efficacy determined by genotyping. ",0
4200,4200,21631324,gp100 peptide vaccine and interleukin-2 in patients with advanced melanoma,"BACKGROUND: Stimulating an immune response against cancer with the use of vaccines remains a challenge. We hypothesized that combining a melanoma vaccine with interleukin-2, an immune activating agent, could improve outcomes. In a previous phase 2 study, patients with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose interleukin-2 plus the gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine had a higher rate of response than the rate that is expected among patients who are treated with interleukin-2 alone. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, phase 3 trial involving 185 patients at 21 centers. Eligibility criteria included stage IV or locally advanced stage III cutaneous melanoma, expression of HLA*A0201, an absence of brain metastases, and suitability for high-dose interleukin-2 therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 alone (720,000 IU per kilogram of body weight per dose) or gp100:209-217(210M) plus incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51) once per cycle, followed by interleukin-2. The primary end point was clinical response. Secondary end points included toxic effects and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics and received a similar amount of interleukin-2 per cycle. The toxic effects were consistent with those expected with interleukin-2 therapy. The vaccine-interleukin-2 group, as compared with the interleukin-2-only group, had a significant improvement in centrally verified overall clinical response (16% vs. 6%, P=0.03), as well as longer progression-free survival (2.2 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 3.9 vs. 1.6 months; 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.8; P=0.008). The median overall survival was also longer in the vaccine-interleukin-2 group than in the interleukin-2-only group (17.8 months; 95% CI, 11.9 to 25.8 vs. 11.1 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 16.3; P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced melanoma, the response rate was higher and progression-free survival longer with vaccine and interleukin-2 than with interleukin-2 alone.

3413,3413,17985001,Metastatic tumors of the uvea in 38 eyes,"The reported incidence of metastatic uveal tumors has been increasing. The aim of this study is to report the clinical features, management, and prognosis of uveal metastatic tumors seen in a general oncology hospital. The records of 28 patients with uveal metastasis diagnosed between 1999 and 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Uveal metastatic tumours were detected in a total of 38 eyes, uveal involvement included the iris in 4 eyes and the choroid in 37 eyes. Ten patients (35.7%) had bilateral uveal involvement. The primary cancer site was the breast in 24 patients, the lung in 2 patients, the ovary in 1 patient, and the gastrointestinal tract in 1 patient. While the most common symptom was blurred vision, 14.2% of patients were asymptomatic. Choroidal metastases typically were creamy yellow in color, plateau or dome-shaped, and associated with secondary retinal detachment in 56.8% of eyes. The mean time interval between ocular and systemic diagnosis was 41.07 months. At the time of ocular diagnosis, 75% of patients had systemic metastasis. Eight eyes were treated with chemotherapy and hormone therapy, and external beam radiotherapy was applied to 30 eyes. Lesions commonly responded well to therapy, but 22 patients died as a result of disseminated systemic disease. Patients with uveal metastasis generally present to ophthalmologists with visual symptoms but may be asymptomatic in some cases. Local tumor control can be managed with current therapy, but systemic prognosis is generally poor because of the disseminated stage of the malignant disease. ",0
6997,6997,32459923,FDA Initiative for Drug Facts Label for Over-the-Counter Naloxone,"""BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis highlights the need to increase access to naloxone, possibly through regulatory approval for over-the-counter sales. To address industry-perceived barriers to such access, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed a model drug facts label for such sales to assess whether consumers understood the key statements for safe and effective use. METHODS: In this label-comprehension study, we conducted individual structured interviews with 710 adults and adolescents, including 430 adults who use opioids and their family and friends. Eight primary end points were developed to assess user comprehension of each of the key steps in the label. Each of these end points included a prespecified target threshold ranging from 80 to 90% that was evaluated through a comparison of the lower boundary of the 95% exact confidence interval. RESULTS: The results for performance on six primary end points met or exceeded thresholds, including the steps """"Check for a suspected overdose"""" (threshold, 85%; point estimate [PE], 95.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0 to 97.1) and """"Give the first dose"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 98.2%; 95% CI, 96.9 to 99.0). The lower boundaries for four other primary end points ranged from 88.8 to 94.0%. One exception was comprehension of """"Call 911 immediately,"""" but this instruction closely approximated the target of 90% (PE, 90.3%; 95% CI, 87.9 to 92.4). Another exception was comprehension of the composite step of """"Check, give, and call 911 immediately"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 81.1%; 95% CI, 78.0 to 83.9). CONCLUSIONS: Consumers met thresholds for sufficient understanding of six of eight components of the instructions in the drug facts label for naloxone use and came close on two others. Overall, the FDA found that the model label was adequate for use in the development of a naloxone product intended for over-the-counter sales.""",0
13403,13403,24528208,Milestones in understanding platelet production: a historical overview,"The discovery of thrombopoietin (TPO, also termed THPO) in 1994 was a major achievement in understanding the regulation of platelet production. In prior decades, physiological studies had demonstrated that platelets were produced from bone marrow megakaryocytes and that the megakaryocytes responded to thrombocytopenia by increasing their number, size and DNA ploidy. In 1958, it was proposed that a 'thrombopoietin' must exist that regulated this interaction between the circulating platelet mass and the bone marrow megakaryocytes. After over three decades of effort, TPO was finally purified by five independent laboratories. TPO stimulated megakaryocyte colony-forming cell growth and increased the number, size and ploidy of megakaryocytes. When the genes for TPO or TPO receptor were eliminated in mice, megakaryocytes grew and platelets were made, but at 15% of their normal number. A first generation of recombinant human (rh) TPO molecules [rhTPO and pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rhMGDF)] rapidly entered clinical trials in 1995 and increased platelet counts in humans undergoing non-myeloablative chemotherapy but not in those undergoing stem cell transplantation. Antibodies developed against PEG-rhMGDF and development of these recombinant thrombopoietins ended. A second generation of TPO receptor agonists (romiplostim and eltrombopag) was then developed. Neither of these TPO receptor agonists demonstrated any significant untoward effects and both are now licensed in many countries for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. This review describes the significant experiments that have surrounded the discovery of TPO and its clinical development.",1
12609,12609,22171861,The health impacts of khat: a qualitative study among Somali-Australians,"OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of khat use among Somali-Australians in Australia and to explore their views about the links between khat use and personal health. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative study using semistructured focus groups among adult members of Somali communities in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth who volunteered to attend focus groups in January and December 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergent themes related to Somali-Australians' understanding of the links between khat use and personal health. RESULTS: Nineteen focus groups included 114�participants. Khat use was reported to be common among the Somali community, and more common among men than women. Khat was usually chewed in prolonged sessions, producing mild psychostimulant effects such as increased energy, enhanced mood, reduced appetite and reduced sleep. Khat was widely perceived to be a food, not a drug, and as harmless, or even beneficial, to the user's health. Many users reported discontinuation effects such as lethargy, sleep disturbances and mood problems after sessions of heavy khat use, and some reported self-medicating with alcohol to cope with such problems. Problems of addiction to khat were identified by some participants, but not all believed it is addictive. Many khat users reported visiting their health professionals for treatment of adverse effects and failing to disclose their khat use. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals require greater awareness of khat use and related health problems. Health promotion activities targeting communities with high levels of khat use are required to increase understanding of the potential risks of regular khat use, to promote harm-reduction strategies, and to increase awareness of services available for those experiencing harm. Health professionals should consider targeted screening for khat use among individuals from Horn of Africa communities who present to health services.",1
7272,7272,896955,Back stabilization during knee strengthening exercise,"Twenty normal women were tested for maximal isometric contraction of the right knee extensor muscles. The knee was positioned in 60 degrees of extension and the hip at 120 degrees of extension, with and without a backrest. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the use of a backrest resulted in greater force than when not using a backrest when the angle of back inclination was held constant and the support was varied. The results indicated that the addition of a backrest, when the body assumes an optimal position, enables the knee extensors to generate greater force then when no backrest is used. A backrest adds to the comfort and support of the subject performing resistive knee exercise and should be incorporated into the design of knee exercise units.",1
7199,7199,615837,Hyperplasia and prolapse of hepatocytes into hepatic veins during longterm methyltestosterone therapy: possible relationships of these changes to the developement of peliosis hepatis and liver tumours,"We report the pathological changes in liver biopsies from 10 patients (four female transexuals and six impotent males) after treatment with 150 mg methyltestosterone daily for periods of up to 3 years, and in a hemihepatectomy specimen from a female transexual who developed a liver adenoma after 37 months of this treatment. Hepatocyte hyperplasia and mild focal sinusoidal dilatation was found in most cases. In some cases there were microcysts and dissociation of hepatocytes. In nine patients there was accumulation of hepatocytes between the endothelium and the supporting collagen of hepatic veins which often resulted in either partial occlusion of their lumina or disruption of their walls. These vascular changes do not appear to have been reported before. It is postulated that a single pathological process-hyperplasia, perhaps related to the anabolic effect of methyltestosterone--could be partly responsible both for the formation of cysts through mechanical obstruction of hepatic veins and for the formation of nodules and tumours.",1

3066,3066,16291984,Sildenafil citrate therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension,"BACKGROUND: Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5, an enzyme that metabolizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate, thereby enhancing the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated relaxation and growth inhibition of vascular smooth-muscle cells, including those in the lung. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (either idiopathic or associated with connective-tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts) to placebo or sildenafil (20, 40, or 80 mg) orally three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes. The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed, but the study was not powered to assess mortality. Patients completing the 12-week randomized study could enter a long-term extension study. RESULTS: The distance walked in six minutes increased from baseline in all sildenafil groups; the mean placebo-corrected treatment effects were 45 m (+13.0 percent), 46 m (+13.3 percent), and 50 m (+14.7 percent) for 20, 40, and 80 mg of sildenafil, respectively (P<0.001 for all comparisons). All sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary-artery pressure (P=0.04, P=0.01, and P<0.001, respectively), improved the WHO functional class (P=0.003, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively), and were associated with side effects such as flushing, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo. Among the 222 patients completing one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy, the improvement from baseline at one year in the distance walked in six minutes was 51 m. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil improves exercise capacity, WHO functional class, and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension.",0
3289,3289,17507703,Rescue use of beclomethasone and albuterol in a single inhaler for mild asthma,"BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines recommend the regular use of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with mild persistent asthma. We investigated whether the symptom-driven use of a combination of beclomethasone dipropionate and albuterol (also known as salbutamol) in a single inhaler would be as effective as the regular use of inhaled beclomethasone and superior to the as-needed use of inhaled albuterol. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group trial. After a 4-week run-in, patients with mild asthma were randomly assigned to receive one of four inhaled treatments: placebo twice daily plus 250 microg of beclomethasone and 100 microg of albuterol in a single inhaler as needed (as-needed combination therapy); placebo twice daily plus 100 microg of albuterol as needed (as-needed albuterol therapy); 250 microg of beclomethasone twice daily and 100 microg of albuterol as needed (regular beclomethasone therapy); or 250 microg of beclomethasone and 100 microg of albuterol in a single inhaler twice daily plus 100 microg of albuterol as needed (regular combination therapy). The primary outcome was the morning peak expiratory flow rate. RESULTS: In 455 patients with mild asthma who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2.96 liters (88.36% of the predicted value), the morning peak expiratory flow rate during the last 2 weeks of the 6-month treatment was higher (P=0.04) and the number of exacerbations during the 6-month treatment was lower (P=0.002) in the as-needed combination therapy group than in the as-needed albuterol therapy group, but the values in the as-needed combination therapy group were not significantly different from those in the groups receiving regular beclomethasone therapy or regular combination therapy. The cumulative dose of inhaled beclomethasone was lower in the as-needed combination therapy group than in the groups receiving regular beclomethasone therapy or regular combination therapy (P<0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild asthma, the symptom-driven use of inhaled beclomethasone (250 microg) and albuterol (100 microg) in a single inhaler is as effective as regular use of inhaled beclomethasone (250 microg twice daily) and is associated with a lower 6-month cumulative dose of the inhaled corticosteroid.

9184,9184,8707404,Cancer incidence and mortality in women receiving estrogen and estrogen-progestin replacement therapy--long-term follow-up of a Swedish cohort,"We analyzed cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 22,597 Swedish women who were prescribed replacement hormones. After 13 years of follow-up in national registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed. Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16 cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen-progestin combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer with follow-up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) after 10 years of follow-up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased, with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone, whereas those given an estrogen-progestin combination showed no elevation in risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol-progestin compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvar/vaginal, rectal, pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors, malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of follow-up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but tended to increase with follow-up time. We conclude that hormone replacement increases the endometrial-cancer risk after unopposed estrogens and the breast-cancer risk-notably after estrogen-progestin combined therapy-and tentatively suggest that it exerts a protective effect against colon and liver cancer risks.",1

Several somatic augmentation strategies are proposed in the scientific literature, with different levels of evidence for safety and efficacy. The purpose of the present study is to review the available literature on the efficacy and safety of clozapine augmentation with somatic agents other than antipsychotics. The following classes of agents are considered: (1) mood stabilizers, (2) antidepressants, (3) electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, (4) glutamatergic agents, (5)fatty acids supplements, and (6) benzodiazepines. Case controls and small-size clinical trials largely dominate the literature, limiting the power to draw conclusions concerning safety issues and the meaning of negative studies. Moreover, variable definitions of clozapine resistance, heterogeneous outcome measures, and short duration of treatment trials are additional limitations. Generally, adjunctive strategies for clozapine-resistant patients remain based on scarce evidence of efficacy and significant safety concerns. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, fatty acids supplements, and mirtazapine showed good tolerability and some efficacy, but the results need replication. ",0

4675,4675,23835026,The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Despite recent advances in acute stroke treatment, basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is associated with a death or disability rate of close to 70%. Randomised trials have shown the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) given within 4.5 h and have shown promising results of intra-arterial thrombolysis given within 6 h of symptom onset of acute ischaemic stroke, but these results do not directly apply to patients with an acute BAO because only few, if any, of these patients were included in randomised acute stroke trials.Recently the results of the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS), a prospective registry of patients with acute symptomatic BAO challenged the often-held assumption that intra-arterial treatment (IAT) is superior to IVT. Our observations in the BASICS registry underscore that we continue to lack a proven treatment modality for patients with an acute BAO and that current clinical practice varies widely. BASICS is a randomised controlled, multicentre, open label, phase III intervention trial with blinded outcome assessment, investigating the efficacy and safety of additional IAT after IVT in patients with BAO. The trial targets to include 750 patients, aged 18 to 85 years, with CT angiography or MR angiography confirmed BAO treated with IVT. Patients will be randomised between additional IAT followed by optimal medical care versus optimal medical care alone. IVT has to be initiated within 4.5 h from estimated time of BAO and IAT within 6 h. The primary outcome parameter will be favourable outcome at day 90 defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3. The BASICS registry was observational and has all the limitations of a non-randomised study. As the IAT approach becomes increasingly available and frequently utilised an adequately powered randomised controlled phase III trial investigating the added value of this therapy in patients with an acute symptomatic BAO is needed (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01717755).

Neem oil is a vegetable oil derived from seeds or fruits of the neem tree through pressing or solvent extraction, and largely used in popular medicine to have antifungal, antibacterial, antimalarial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, as well as immunemodulatory properties in different animal species. In the present study, acute and 28-day subacute toxicity tests were carried out. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 values of neem oil were found to be 31.95g/kg. The subacute treatment with neem oil failed to change body weight gain, food and water consumption. Serum biochemistry analysis showed no significant differences in any of the parameters examined under the dose of 1600mg/kg/day. Histopathological exams showed that the target organs of neem oil were testicle, liver and kidneys up to the dose of 1600mg/kg/day.",1

3116,3116,16507146,Cytokine polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes in SLE patients treated with antimalarial drugs,"Antimalarial agents have been widely used as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatological diseases, although their mechanism of action has not yet been fully defined. It is known, however, that effective response to treatment is variable among patients. Thus, the identification of genetic predictors of treatment response would provide valuable information for therapeutic intervention. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of antimalarial treatment on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha serum levels and evaluate the possible influence of TNFalpha and IL-10 functional genetic polymorphisms on the response to antimalarial drugs. To this end, TNFalpha serum levels were quantified in 171 SLE patients and 215 healthy controls by ELISA techniques and polymorphisms at positions -1,082 and -308 of the IL-10 and TNFalpha gene promoters were determined by PCR amplification followed by hybridization with fluorescent-labeled allele-specific probes in 192 SLE patients and 343 matched controls. Data were related to clinical features and treatment at the time of sampling and during the course of the disease. Results showed a significantly higher amount of serum TNFalpha in the entire SLE population compared with controls. However, TNFalpha serum levels correlated negatively with the use of antimalarial treatment during at least three months before sampling. Patients under single or combined treatment with these drugs had TNFalpha serum levels similar to healthy controls, whereas untreated patients and those under corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies had increased amounts of this cytokine. This suggests, however, that antimalarial-mediated inhibition of TNFalpha was only significant in patients who were genetically high TNFalpha or low IL-10 producers. In addition, evaluation of SLE patients administered antimalarial drugs for three or more years who did not require any other specific SLE treatment indicates that patients with the combined genotype low IL-10/high TNFalpha are the best responders to antimalarial therapy, developing mild disease with a good course under this treatment. In conclusion, we proposed that an antimalarial-mediated downregulation of TNFalpha levels in SLE patients is influenced by polymorphisms at IL-10 and TNFalpha promoters. Our results may thus find important clinical application through the identification of patients who are the most likely to benefit from antimalarial therapy. ",0

This study was conducted to identify variables that affect phenobarbital fate during routine clinical care and then to evaluate the dosage schedule that could be applied in term asphyxiated neonates with respect to achieving the target therapeutic range. Phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was calculated based on serum concentrations measurements using one-compartmental model. Body weight, body surface area, gestational age, creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, international normalized ratio, Apgar scores, umbilical cord arterial pH and base excess were explored as covariates in linear regression models. Based on this analysis, phenobarbital loading and maintenance dose regimen were projected. In the whole study population (N = 36), phenobarbital volume of distribution, clearance and half-life median (interquartile range) values were 0.49 (0.38-0.59) L/kg, 0.0045 (0.0034-0.0055) L/h/kg and 75.1 (60.2-103.3) hours, respectively. The drug volume of distribution was associated with body weight, length and body surface area, whereas clearance was not in relationship with any explored features. Weight-normalized loading dose of 15 mg/kg and weight-normalized daily maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg proved to be optimal in our study population to reach phenobarbital therapeutic range. This study presents basis for phenobarbital initial dosing in term asphyxiated neonates during first week of life. Phenobarbital weight-normalized loading dose of 15 mg/kg lead to simulated target peak concentrations in 72% of neonates, weight-normalized maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg lead to steady state within therapeutic window in the same proportion of patients.

3170,3170,16518291,Difficulty in diagnosing acute appendicitis in the presence of acute portal vein thrombosis: the role of CT scan. Report of 2 cases],Acute appendicitis can cause of portal vein thrombosis. Diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult because its symptoms may be masked by those of acute portal vein thrombosis. We report 2 cases of appendicitis associated with acute portal vein thrombosis whose diagnosis was delayed by several months. The delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the presence of acute portal vein thrombosis can be avoided by using spiral-computed tomography and careful investigation of signs of appendicitis. ,0
6438,6438,29526139,Two-Year Outcomes with a Magnetically Levitated Cardiac Pump in Heart Failure,"BACKGROUND: In an early analysis of this trial, use of a magnetically levitated centrifugal continuous-flow circulatory pump was found to improve clinical outcomes, as compared with a mechanical-bearing axial continuous-flow pump, at 6 months in patients with advanced heart failure. METHODS: In a randomized noninferiority and superiority trial, we compared the centrifugal-flow pump with the axial-flow pump in patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of the intended goal of support (bridge to transplantation or destination therapy). The composite primary end point was survival at 2 years free of disabling stroke (with disabling stroke indicated by a modified Rankin score of >3; scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) or survival free of reoperation to replace or remove a malfunctioning device. The noninferiority margin for the risk difference (centrifugal-flow pump group minus axial-flow pump group) was -10 percentage points. RESULTS: Of 366 patients, 190 were assigned to the centrifugal-flow pump group and 176 to the axial-flow pump group. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary end point occurred in 151 patients (79.5%) in the centrifugal-flow pump group, as compared with 106 (60.2%) in the axial-flow pump group (absolute difference, 19.2 percentage points; 95% lower confidence boundary, 9.8 percentage points [P<0.001 for noninferiority]; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.69 [P<0.001 for superiority]). Reoperation for pump malfunction was less frequent in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in the axial-flow pump group (3 patients [1.6%] vs. 30 patients [17.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.27; P<0.001). The rates of death and disabling stroke were similar in the two groups, but the overall rate of stroke was lower in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in the axial-flow pump group (10.1% vs. 19.2%; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.84, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced heart failure, a fully magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pump was superior to a mechanical-bearing axial-flow pump with regard to survival free of disabling stroke or reoperation to replace or remove a malfunctioning device.

4834,4834,24224625,"Publication of trials funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute","BACKGROUND: Rapid publication of clinical trials is essential in order for the findings to yield maximal benefits for public health and scientific progress. Factors affecting the speed of publication of the main results of government-funded trials have not been well characterized. METHODS: We analyzed 244 extramural randomized clinical trials of cardiovascular interventions that were supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). We selected trials for which data collection had been completed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011. Our primary outcome measure was the time between completion of the trial and publication of the main results in a peer-reviewed journal. RESULTS: As of March 31, 2012, the main results of 156 trials (64%) had been published (Kaplan-Meier median time to publication, 25 months, with 57% published within 30 months). Trials that focused on clinical events were published more rapidly than those that focused on surrogate measures (median, 9 months vs. 31 months; P<0.001). The only independent predictors of more rapid publication were a focus on clinical events rather than surrogate end points (adjusted publication rate ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 3.53; P=0.004) and higher costs of conducting the trial, up to a threshold of approximately $5 million (P<0.001). The 37 trials that focused on clinical events and cost at least $5 million accounted for 67% of the funds spent on clinical trials but received 82% of the citations. After adjustment of the analysis for a focus on clinical events and for cost, trial results that were classified as positive were published more quickly than those classified as negative. CONCLUSIONS: Results of less than two thirds of NHLBI-funded randomized clinical trials of cardiovascular interventions were published within 30 months after completion of the trial. Trials that focused on clinical events were published more quickly than those that focused on surrogate end points. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.).",0
6328,6328,29183075,Chemical Composition and Labeling of Substances Marketed as Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators and Sold via the Internet,"Recent reports have described the increasing use of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators, which have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to enhance appearance and performance. The composition and purity of such products is not known. To determine the chemical identity and the amounts of ingredients in dietary supplements and products marketed and sold through the internet as selective androgen receptor modulators and compare the analyzed contents with product labels. Web-based searches were performed from February 18, 2016, to March 25, 2016, using the Google search engine on the Chrome and Internet Explorer web browsers to identify suppliers selling selective androgen receptor modulators. The products were purchased and the identities of the compounds and their amounts were determined from April to August 2016 using chain-of-custody and World Anti-Doping Association-approved analytical procedures. Analytical findings were compared against the label information. Products marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators. Chemical identities and the amount of ingredients in each product marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators. Among 44 products marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators, only 23 (52%) contained 1 or more selective androgen receptor modulators (Ostarine, LGD-4033, or Andarine). An additional 17 products (39%) contained another unapproved drug, including the growth hormone secretagogue ibutamoren, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ agonist GW501516, and the Rev-ErbA agonist SR9009. Of the 44 tested products, no active compound was detected in 4 (9%) and substances not listed on the label were contained in 11 (25%). In only 18 of the 44 products (41%), the amount of active compound in the product matched that listed on the label. The amount of the compounds listed on the label differed substantially from that found by analysis in 26 of 44 products (59%). In this limited investigation involving chemical analyses of 44 products marketed as selective androgen receptor modulators and sold via the internet, most products contained unapproved drugs and substances. Only 52% contained selective androgen receptor modulators and many were inaccurately labeled. ",0
10284,10284,12740787,Sirolimus as primary immunosuppression in liver transplantation is not associated with hepatic artery or wound complications,"Sirolimus is a new immunosuppressive agent increasingly being used in liver transplant recipients. There is concern that sirolimus may be associated with wound complications and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). We have used sirolimus as primary immunosuppression in 170 liver transplant recipients and therefore reviewed our experience with wound complications and HAT in our cohort of patients. Records of all 170 patients administered sirolimus as primary immunosuppression and 180 historic controls were reviewed. Numbers of wound and hepatic artery complications were recorded, as well as the prevalence of obesity, reoperation, diabetes, and OKT3 use, all of which are risk factors for wound complications. The prevalence of wound complications was 12.4% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 13.9% in historic controls (P = not significant [NS]). The prevalence of hepatic artery complications was 5.3% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 8.3% in historic controls (P = NS). The prevalence of obesity and OKT3 administration was significantly lower in sirolimus-treated patients. Multivariate analysis failed to show an association between sirolimus therapy and hepatic artery or wound complications. The prevalence of wound and hepatic artery complications is not different in liver transplant recipients administered sirolimus as part of a primary immunosuppressive regimen compared with historic controls.",1
574,574,1773964,Wilson's disease in Scotland,"The prevalence and clinical features of Wilson's disease in Scotland were investigated. Thirty three cases were identified but adequate information was available on only 28. In 1989, the prevalence rate was 4 per million. Ten patients with a mean (SEM) age of 18 (1.9) years presented with neurological symptoms, 12 patients aged 14 (1.7) years presented with hepatic symptoms, and six patients aged 12 (0.9) years were asymptomatic siblings of patients with Wilson's disease. Nine (56%) of the 16 patients who underwent liver biopsy on presentation were found to have cirrhosis. Penicillamine treatment was stopped in nine patients because of: abnormal peripheral blood count (6), rash (2), and patient's own choice (1). Nineteen patients were alive in 1989 -12 were well, one had chronic liver failure, four chronic neurological disabilities, and two had both chronic liver failure and neurological disabilities. Twelve patients died from: complications of chronic liver failure (2), acute liver failure (4), pneumonia associated with immobility (4), and other causes (2).

6762,6762,30765508,"A randomised, placebo-controlled study of omipalisib (PI3K/mTOR) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Omipalisib (GSK2126458) is a potent inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR.A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeat dose escalation, experimental medicine study of omipalisib in subjects with IPF was conducted (NCT01725139) to test safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Omipalisib was dosed at 0.25 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg twice daily for 8 days in four cohorts of four subjects randomised 3:1 to receive omipalisib or placebo (two cohorts received 2 mg twice daily).17 subjects with IPF were enrolled. The most common adverse event was diarrhoea, which was reported by four participants. Dose-related increases in insulin and glucose were observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that exposure in the blood predicts lung exposure. Exposure-dependent inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate and pAKT confirmed target engagement in blood and lungs.  ",0
7716,7716,2593049,Animal model of margosa oil ingestion with Reye-like syndrome. Pathogenesis of microvesicular fatty liver,"The aetiology and pathogenesis of Reye's syndrome (RS) are incompletely understood. A number of environmental toxins and biological agents, including viruses, have been postulated to cause RS, either acting alone or synergistically. Most investigations have suggested that the primary insult is in the liver mitochondria, leading to a complex biochemical catastrophe, with death from encephalopathy. Margosa oil (MO), a long-chain fatty acid compound, has been shown to cause a Reye-like syndrome with death from hepatoencephalopathy, in children in Malaysia and India. The present time-course study performed in MO-administered mice showed the development of hepatic lesions with many features of RS. MO acts rapidly, within 30 min, on the nuclei of hepatocytes inducing mitoses and binucleated cells. This is followed by mitochondrial injury, with swelling, rarefaction of matrix, loss of dense bodies, pleomorphism, and loss of ribosomes starting at 60 min. There is loss of liver glycogen, and proliferation and hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by the presence of lipid droplets in the hyaloplasm, and globules within dilated cisterns of the ER. Additional fatty acids from lipolysis of body adipocytes, and fat globules from intestinal MO ingestion further aggravate the liver fatty change. There is evidence of fat globule ingestion by endocytosis into hepatocytes at the level of the sinusoids. The development of microvesicular liver steatosis and glycogen depletion due to involvement of liver cell organelles occur rapidly as in RS.",1
6197,6197,28942404,Successful treatment using rituximab in a patient with refractory polymyositis complicated by scleroderma renal crisis,"Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory myopathies. Myositis can be a clinical feature of scleroderma (polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome), and treatment of this syndrome is a challenge for clinicians because moderate to high doses of corticosteroids are considered a risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in affected patients. We report here the case of a 56-year-old woman with scleroderma who developed polymyositis and was successfully treated with rituximab. Initial treatment of the polymyositis with prednisolone 40 mg/day was rapidly tapered to 2.5 mg/day due to development of scleroderma renal crisis, for which four weekly infusions of rituximab (500 mg; off-label) were given. She responded well to rituximab in addition to prednisolone 2.5 mg/day. Rituximab may improve inflammatory myopathies, even in cases where high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided due to complications. Rituximab should be considered as a treatment option in cases of refractory polymyositis. ",0
360,360,1524655,Interindividual variabilities in haloperidol interconversion and the reduced haloperidol/haloperidol ratio,"Metabolism of haloperidol in humans includes N-dealkylation to inactive metabolites and reduction to reduced haloperidol; reduced haloperidol is also oxidized back to haloperidol. A single 0.5 mg/kg (0.00133 mmol/kg) oral dose of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol was administered to seven Chinese schizophrenics in a randomized crossover manner separated by a 2-week interval. The clearance values for the different metabolic pathways of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol were determined. There were differences up to 10-fold in both oxidation and reduction capacities. There were also interindividual variabilities in the elimination of reduced haloperidol (0.37 +/- 0.20 L/hr/kg) and the N-dealkylation pathway (0.74 +/- 0.36 L/hr/kg). Four weeks after the single-dose study, the same patients also received haloperidol (10 mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. The reduced haloperidol to haloperidol concentration ratio (0.40 +/- 0.16) after the 4-week therapy is related to individual variabilities in the interconversion process and the N-dealkylation pathway of haloperidol.

6393,6393,29194682,Impact of hepatitis C virus polymorphisms on direct-acting antiviral treatment efficacy: Regulatory analyses and perspectives,"Several highly effective, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens are available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite impressive efficacy overall, a small proportion of patients in registrational trials experienced treatment failure, which in some cases was associated with the detection of HCV resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at baseline. In this article, we describe methods and key findings from independent regulatory analyses investigating the impact of baseline nonstructural (NS) 3 Q80K and NS5A RASs on the efficacy of current United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for patients with HCV genotype (GT) 1 or GT3 infection. These analyses focused on clinical trials that included patients who were previously na?ve to the DAA class(es) in their investigational regimen and characterized the impact of baseline RASs that were enriched in the viral population as natural or transmitted polymorphisms (i.e., not drug-selected RASs). We used a consistent approach to optimize comparability of results across different DAA regimens and patient populations, including the use of a 15% sensitivity cutoff for next-generation sequencing results and standardized lists of NS5A RASs. These analyses confirmed that detection of NS3 Q80K or NS5A baseline RASs was associated with reduced treatment efficacy for multiple DAA regimens, but their impact was often minimized with the use of an intensified treatment regimen, such as a longer treatment duration and/or addition of ribavirin. We discuss the drug resistance-related considerations that contributed to pretreatment resistance testing and treatment recommendations in drug labeling for FDA-approved DAA regimens. CONCLUSION: Independent regulatory analyses confirmed that baseline HCV RASs can reduce the efficacy of certain DAA-based regimens in selected patient groups. However, highly effective treatment options are available for patients with or without baseline RASs. (Hepatology 2018;67:2430-2448).",0
3301,3301,17582070,Natural history of multiple sclerosis with childhood onset,"BACKGROUND: The course and prognosis of childhood-onset multiple sclerosis have not been well described. METHODS: We used data from 13 adult neurology departments affiliated with the European Database for Multiple Sclerosis (EDMUS) network to identify a cohort of 394 patients who had multiple sclerosis with an onset at 16 years of age or younger and a comparison group of 1775 patients who had multiple sclerosis with an onset after 16 years of age. We determined the initial clinical features, the dates of disease onset, and the occurrence of outcomes, including relapse, conversion to secondary progression, and irreversible disability as measured by scores of 4 (limited walking ability but ability to walk more than 500 m without aid or rest), 6 (ability to walk with unilateral support no more than 100 m without rest), and 7 (ability to walk no more than 10 m without rest while using a wall or furniture for support) on the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (range, 0 to 10; higher scores indicate more severe disability). RESULTS: For patients with childhood-onset multiple sclerosis, the estimated median time from onset to secondary progression was 28 years, and the median age at conversion to secondary progression was 41 years. The median times from onset to disability scores of 4, 6, and 7 were 20.0, 28.9, and 37.0 years, respectively, and the corresponding median ages were 34.6, 42.2, and 50.5 years. In comparison with patients with adult-onset disease, those with childhood-onset disease were more likely to be female than male (female:male ratio, 2.8 vs. 1.8), were more likely to have an exacerbating-remitting initial course (98% vs. 84%), took approximately 10 years longer to reach secondary progression and irreversible disability, and reached these landmarks at an age approximately 10 years younger (P<0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with childhood-onset multiple sclerosis take longer to reach states of irreversible disability but do so at a younger age than patients with adult-onset multiple sclerosis.",0

Findings in bile ducts from 11 methotrexate treated psoriatics and 2 controls,To determinate what damage occurred in the bile ducts of psoriatics receiving Methotrexate (MTX) therapy liver biopsies from 11 patients were studied with the light and electron microscope and compared with normal material. Thick sections (1 micrometer) showed light and dark cells in biliary epithelium and lipofuscin granules. At the ultrastructural level these were confirmed. The lumen of the bile ducts contained debris. The microvilli were decreased in number and damaged forms appeared. Damage to the biliary epithelial mitochondria was widespread and there were foci of intracellular oedema. The Golgi apparatus was hypertrophied and dilated. Atrophic cells were seen. The lateral intercellular spaces were dilated and contained debris and the basement membrane showed zones of duplication. Similar changes were found in the ducts of Hering.,1
7595,7595,2125388,Vascular hepatotoxicity related to heroin addiction,"""The hepatotoxic effect of heroin has been demonstrated in liver biopsies by morphometric analysis of four groups of patients: twenty-one drug abusers (DA) at the time of the biopsy, eighteen patients who had stopped drug consumption for at least six months (ex-DA), twelve patients with post-transfusional chronic active hepatitis (PTCAH), and eleven controls (CONTROL). Semiquantitative assessment showed the extent of sinusoidal dilatation and the inflammatory and fibrotic reaction in the terminal hepatic vein (THV). Thickening and cellularity of the venular wall and the volume density of sinusoidal lumen (Vsl) in the Zone I and III of the hepatic acinus, were also evaluated. The morphometric analysis used computerized measurements. In DA, the sinusoidal dilatation (100% of cases), the sinusoidal and THV inflammation (81% and 67.7%, respectively), localized mainly in the centrilobular zone, were more pronounced than in ex-DA, in patients with PTCAH and in CONTROL (significantly different P less than 0.0001). Conversely, the fibrotic reaction (perisinusoidal fibrosis--44.4% and perivenular fibrosis--61.1%) was more frequent in ex-DA. The THV inflammation in DA was replaced by a fibrotic matrix deposit in the THV wall (wall surface/internal surface = 2.72 +/- 0.37 in ex-DA; 1.38 +/- 0.32 in DA; 0.87 +/- 0.14 in PTCAH and 0.45 +/- 0.03 in CONTROL--significantly different P less than 0.001), associated with a perisinusoidal fibrosis, after drug withdrawal. Moreover, there was significantly decreased venular wall cellularity in ex-DA (wall surface/mesenchymal cells = 949 +/- 158 in ex-DA; 622 +/- 40 in DA; 619 +/- 61 in PTCAH; 547 +/- 23 in CONTROL--P less than 0.001). Semiquantitative and morphometric data suggest that these vascular lesions and their reversibility may be due to the direct hepatotoxic effects of heroin.""",1
7894,7894,3154674,The pharmacology of nisoldipine,"Nisoldipine is a calcium antagonist that specifically blocks the slow or voltage-dependent calcium channel up to the highest concentrations. This mode of action has been confirmed in pharmacological studies on isolated organs, electrophysiological and binding studies, and by the measurement of transmembrane calcium transport. As with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, an interaction with intracellular calcium reservoirs and calmodulin seems to be of minor importance. The drug exhibits higher potency, longer duration of action, and a higher binding affinity in vitro and in vivo than nifedipine. In contrast to its vasodilating and spasmolytic activity, its negative inotropic effect occurs in vitro only after higher concentrations than after nifedipine. In whole animals a secondary positive inotropic effect occurs regularly owing to sympathetic counter-regulation. The influence of nisoldipine on cardiac stimulus formation and conduction is also very slight in anesthetized animals, and is completely eliminated in awake animals and humans by counter-regulation up to very high doses. The cardiac anti-ischemic action of nisoldipine has been demonstrated in various ischemia models and is probably based predominantly on its afterload-reducing properties in addition to its spasmolytic effect on the coronary arteries. Various other suspected effects, for which there are isolated indications, e.g., inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, preload reduction, interaction with the transport of adenosine, and normalization of the sarcolemmal Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, are probably of subordinate importance. Its antihypertensive effect is explained primarily by lowering of the peripheral resistance. There are, however, some indications that nisoldipine exerts certain effects over and above pure vasodilation. The prevention of postischemic calcium overloading in the renal tubule epithelium and the natriuretic effect are probably of importance in the therapeutic action. Clinically, nisoldipine was found more potent and prolonged in its action in comparison with nifedipine. In comparative studies, nisoldipine, 10 mg once a day, was found equieffective with nifedipine 10 mg three times or 20 mg twice a day in angina or hypertension, respectively.",1
4888,4888,24316283,Benefits and risks of splenectomy,"Splenectomy is a powerful therapeutic procedure in a wide variety of medical disorders provided that it is not undertaken lightly and the risks are weighed against the potential benefits in each individual case. Most of this risk seems to be due to the underlying splenectomy indication and not to splenectomy alone. There has been an increased tendency in recent years towards splenic preservation to prevent not only the risk of subsequent overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) but the long term risk of cardiovascular complications. As there is no condition that can be cured by splenectomy, this paper reviewed the rationale behind the indications for, and the associated risks. Electronic searches of the medline (PubMed) database, Cochrane library, and science citation index were performed to identify original published studies on splenectomy.

A comprehensive literature search in the Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases was conducted, and all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Jadad score were used to assess the risk of bias of included studies, and only RCTs scoring ≥3 were included in a meta-analysis. 18 RCTs involving a total of 813 participants (mean age 61.6 years) in the EA groups and 723 participants (mean age 61.9 years) in the control groups were included. The included studies had an average 3 point Jadad score. PSD was diagnosed according to the Chinese Classification of Cerebrovascular Disease (CCCD) and the Chinese Classification of Mental Disease (CCMD) criteria. There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants (fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day) in terms of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores at week 4 after treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.11, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.10), at week 6 after treatment (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.51) or at week 8 after treatment (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.22). However, the combined incidence of adverse events in the EA groups was significantly lower than in the antidepressant groups (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.33). There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants in the severity of depression, however EA caused fewer adverse events than antidepressants. Additional larger scale RCTs with rigorous study design are required. ",0
