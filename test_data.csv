0,63711,Genetic factors in the development of chronic active hepatitis,"In 14 of 16 patients with chronic active hepatitis (C.A.H.) who did not have HLA antigens B8 and/or B12 an external triggering factor (drug or virus) could be demonstrated at onset of symptoms. In contrast external factors were involved in only 11 of 25 cases of C.A.H. in patients with HLA-B8 and/or B12. In the latter group antinuclear antibodies were less common in cases possible triggered by external agents compared with cases in which no such factor was demonstrated. The results suggest that there are at least two pathogenetically different types of C.A.H.---one genetically determined type in which no external factor is involved and in which autoimmune phenomena are common, and another type triggered by environmental agents and not involving predisposing genetic factors.",1

Today, multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of comfrey preparations for the topical treatment of pain, inflammation and swelling of muscles and joints in degenerative arthritis, acute myalgia in the back, sprains, contusions and strains after sports injuries and accidents, also in children aged 3 or 4 and over. This paper provides information on clinical trials and non-interventional studies published on comfrey to date and further literature, substantiating the fact that topical comfrey preparations are a valuable therapy option for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints.",1
3,9392695,Alcohol consumption and mortality among middle-aged and elderly U.S. adults,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has both adverse and beneficial effects on survival. We examined the balance of these in a large prospective study of mortality among U.S. adults. METHODS: Of 490,000 men and women (mean age, 56 years; range, 30 to 104) who reported their alcohol and tobacco use in 1982, 46,000 died during nine years of follow-up. We compared cause-specific and rates of death from all causes across categories of base-line alcohol consumption, adjusting for other risk factors, and related drinking and smoking habits to the cumulative probability of dying between the ages of 35 and 69 years. RESULTS: Causes of death associated with drinking were cirrhosis and alcoholism; cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver combined; breast cancer in women; and injuries and other external causes in men. The mortality from breast cancer was 30 percent higher among women reporting at least one drink daily than among nondrinkers (relative risk, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.6). The rates of death from all cardiovascular diseases were 30 to 40 percent lower among men (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 0.8) and women (relative risk, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.7) reporting at least one drink daily than among nondrinkers, with little relation to the level of consumption. The overall death rates were lowest among men and women reporting about one drink daily. Mortality from all causes increased with heavier drinking, particularly among adults under age 60 with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Alcohol consumption was associated with a small reduction in the overall risk of death in middle age (ages 35 to 69), whereas smoking approximately doubled this risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this middle-aged and elderly population, moderate alcohol consumption slightly reduced overall mortality. The benefit depended in part on age and background cardiovascular risk and was far smaller than the large increase in risk produced by tobacco.",0
4,23656439,Effect of clarithromycin in experimental empyema by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Evidence from a recent randomized study of our group suggests that intravenous clarithromycin resulted in earlier resolution of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The need to understand the mechanism of action of clarithromycin guided to the study of a model of experimental empyema by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 40 rabbits. Animals were randomized into controls (group A); treatment with clarithromycin (group B); treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (group C); and treatment with both agents (group D). Pleural fluid was collected at regular time intervals for quantitative culture, estimation of cell apoptosis and of concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). After 7 days, animals were euthanized for estimation of tissue growth. Bacterial growth in the pleural fluid of group D was significantly decreased compared with the other groups on day 5. Lung growth of group D was lower than group A. That was also the case of cytokine stimulation by pleural fluid samples on U937 monocytes. It is concluded that administration of clarithromycin enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam and decreased bacterial growth in the pleural fluid and in tissues. It also attenuated the pro-inflammatory phenomena induced by the β-lactam. ",0

6,7144866,Magnetic-susceptibility measurement of human iron stores,"We made direct noninvasive magnetic measurements of hepatic iron stores with a specially designed superconducting quantum-interference-device (SQUID) susceptometer in 20 normal subjects and in 110 patients with liver disease, iron deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis, or transfusional iron overload. Magnetic in vivo measurements of liver non-heme iron were closely correlated with chemical in vitro measurements in liver-biopsy specimens (r = 0.98, P less than 10(-5) up to 115 mumol per gram of liver tissue (wet weight) or more. Magnetically determined storage-iron concentrations were below 6.0 mumol per gram in iron-deficient patients and normal men and premenopausal women, but they were raised (9.7 to 31.4 mumol) in 12 of 67 patients with liver disease and were greatly increased (22.9 to 117.7 mumol) in patients with untreated hereditary hemochromatosis or transfusional iron overload. Magnetic measurements of iron stores provide a new quantitative technique for early detection of hereditary hemochromatosis and for rapid evaluation of treatment regimens for transfusional iron overload.",0

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of long-term therapy with oral budesonide (Entocort CIR capsules) for maintenance of clinical remission of collagenous colitis. Patients were aged >18 years with histologically proven collagenous colitis and >3 watery/loose stools per day on >or=4 of the prior 7 days. Open-label oral budesonide 9 mg/d was administered to all patients for 6 weeks. Patients in clinical remission (<or=3 stools per day) at week 6 were subsequently randomized to double-blind oral treatment with budesonide 6 mg/d or matching placebo for 6 months. Relapse was defined as >3 stools per day on >or=4 consecutive days (and included patients withdrawn because of adverse events). RESULTS: Of 48 enrolled patients, 46 (96%) achieved clinical remission at week 6 and were randomized to maintenance budesonide or placebo. There were 21 relapses during maintenance therapy, and almost all occurred during the first 2 months. Budesonide therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative rate of relapse compared with placebo (6/23 [26%] and 15/23 [65%], respectively; P = .022), and high correlation between clinical remission and histologic improvement was observed. Budesonide was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Oral budesonide 6 mg/d is efficacious and well tolerated for long-term maintenance of clinical remission in patients with collagenous colitis.""",1
8,21136019,Rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after hip or knee arthroplasty. Pooled analysis of four studies,"""Four phase III studies compared oral rivaroxaban with subcutaneous enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA). A pooled analysis of these studies compared the effect of rivaroxaban with enoxaparin on symptomatic VTE plus all-cause mortality and bleeding events, and determined whether these effects were consistent in patient subgroups. Patients (N=12,729) aged >/=18 years and scheduled for elective THA or TKA received rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily or 30 mg every 12 hours. The composite of symptomatic VTE and all-cause mortality, the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint and adjudicated bleeding events were analysed in the day 12+/- 2 active treatment pool. Subgroup analyses of these outcomes were performed over the total treatment period. In the day 12+/- 2 pool, the primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 29/6,183 patients receiving rivaroxaban (0.5%) versus 60/6,200 patients receiving enoxaparin (1.0%; p=0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 21 (0.3%) versus 13(0.2%) patients, p=0.23; major plus non-major clinically relevant bleeding in 176(2.8%) versus 152 (2.5%) patients, p=0.19; and any bleeding in 409 (6.6%) versus 384 (6.2%) patients, p=0.38, respectively. The reduction of symptomatic VTE plus all-cause mortality was consistent across prespecified subgroups (age, gender, body weight, creatinine clearance) in the total treatment period. Compared with enoxaparin regimens, rivaroxaban reduces the composite of symptomatic VTE and all-cause mortality after elective THA or TKA, with a small increase in bleeding, no signs of compromised liver safety and fewer serious adverse events.""",1
9,25004292,Simplified technique for reconstruction of the digestive tract after total and subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer,"Laparoscopic surgery has been increasingly applied to gastric cancer surgery. Gastrointestinal tract reconstruction totally done by laparoscopy also has been a challenge for those who developed this procedure. To describe simplified reconstruction after total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer by laparoscopy and the results of its application in a series of cases. In the last four years, 75 patients were operated with gastric cancer and two with GIST. Thirty-four were women and 43 men. The age ranged from 38 to 77 years with an average of 55 years. In two patients with GIST a total and a subtotal gastrectomy were performed. In the other 75 patients were done 21 total gastrectomies and 54 subtotal. In all cancers, gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was completed with at least 37 lymph nodes removed. Was used in these operations a modified laparoscopic technique proposed by the authors consisting in a latero lateral esophagojejunal anastomosis with linear stapler in TG as well in STG, and reconstruction of the digestive continuity also in the upper abdomen. The intraoperative and immediate postoperative course were uneventful, except for one case of bleeding due to an opening clip, necessitating re-intervention. The operative time was 300 minutes, with no difference between total or subtotal gastrectomy. The number of lymph nodes removed varied from 28 to 69, averaging 37. Postoperative staging showed one case in T4 N2 M0; 13 in T2 N0 MO; 27 in T2 N1 M0; 24 in T3 N1 M0 and 10 in T3 N2 M0. Complication in only one case was observed on the 10th postoperative day with a small anastomotic leakage in esophagojejunal anastomose with spontaneous closure. The patient's evolution with no complications, no mortality and just one small anastomotic leakage with no systemic repercussions is a strong indication of the liability and feasibility of this innovative technical method.

10,19299495,Costs and cost-effectiveness of four treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection,"RATIONALE: Isoniazid given daily for 9 months is the standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but its effectiveness is limited by poor completion rates. Shorter course regimens and regimens using directly observed therapy result in improved adherence but have higher upfront costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of regimens for the treatment of LTBI. METHODS: We used a computerized Markov model to estimate total societal costs and benefits associated with four regimens for the treatment of LTBI: self-administered isoniazid daily for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid twice-weekly for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid plus rifapentine once weekly for 3 months, and self-administered rifampin daily for 4 months. In the base-case analysis, subjects were assumed to have newly positive tuberculin skin tests after recent exposure to infectious tuberculosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We determined the costs of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cases of active tuberculosis prevented. In the base-case analysis, rifampin dominated (less costly with increased benefits) all other regimens except isoniazid plus rifapentine, which was more effective at a cost $48,997 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Isoniazid plus rifapentine dominated all regimens at a relative risk of disease 5.2 times the baseline estimate, or with completion rates less than 34% for isoniazid or 37% for rifampin. Rifampin could be 17% less efficacious than self-administered isoniazid and still be cost-saving compared with this regimen. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, rifampin is cost-saving compared with the standard therapy of self-administered isoniazid. Isoniazid plus rifapentine is cost-saving for extremely high-risk patients and is cost-effective for lower-risk patients.",1
11,23629822,Venous thrombosis associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,"""Among the various hypolipidemic drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (also known as """"statins"""") belong to a heterogeneous class of compounds, sharing an identical hypocholesterolemic effect that develops through direct inhibition of a rate-limiting step in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Their mechanism of action entails competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Several lines of evidence suggest that the pleiotropic effects of statins may also play a role in prevention of venous thrombosis, wherein hypercholesterolemic patients are characterized by enhanced thrombin generation, increased susceptibility to endothelial dysfunction and platelet hyperreactivity, so that limiting or counteracting the burden of one or more of these mechanisms would provide an effective means of prophylaxis. Plausible biological links can also be found between statin therapy and reduction of thrombotic risk, mainly targeting immune system, blood coagulation, endothelium, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. The earlier JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention) trial provided appealing evidence that the risk of venous thrombosis may be lowered by statins. The results of the following studies and those of recent meta-analyses have, however, questioned this assumption. Currently, it seems thereby cautious to conclude that the use of statins as part of the approach used for preventing venous thromboembolism appears unwarranted. This is due to the existence of controversial clinical evidence, to the large number of patients who would need to be treated to prevent one case of venous thrombosis, as well as to the tangible risk of side effects. More randomized and the larger studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. """,0
12,18636784,A benefit-risk assessment of benzbromarone in the treatment of gout. Was its withdrawal from the market in the best interest of patients?,"""Benzbromarone, a potent uricosuric drug, was introduced in the 1970s and was viewed as having few associated serious adverse reactions. It was registered in about 20 countries throughout Asia, South America and Europe. In 2003, the drug was withdrawn by Sanofi-Synthelabo, after reports of serious hepatotoxicity, although it is still marketed in several countries by other drug companies. The withdrawal has greatly limited its availability around the world, and increased difficulty in accessing it in other countries where it has never been available.The overall aim of this paper is to determine if the withdrawal of benzbromarone was in the best interests of gouty patients and to present a benefit-risk assessment of benzbromarone. To determine this, we examined (i) the clinical benefits associated with benzbromarone treatment and compared them with the success of alternative therapies such as allopurinol and probenecid, particularly in patients with renal impairment; (ii) the attribution of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity to treatment with benzbromarone; (iii) the incidence of hepatotoxicity possibly due to benzbromarone; (iv) adverse reactions to allopurinol and probenecid. From these analyses, we present recommendations on the use of benzbromarone.Large reductions in plasma urate concentrations in patients with hyperuricaemia are achieved with benzbromarone and most patients normalize their plasma urate. The half-life of benzbromarone is generally short (about 3 hours); however, a uricosuric metabolite, 6-hydroxybenzbromarone, has a much longer half-life (up to 30 hours) and is the major species responsible for the uricosuric activity of benzbromarone, although its metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver may vary between patients as a result of polymorphisms in this enzyme. It is effective in patients with moderate renal impairment. Standard dosages of benzbromarone (100 mg/day) tend to produce greater hypouricaemic effects than standard doses of allopourinol (300 mg/day) or probenecid (1000 mg/day).Adverse effects associated with benzbromarone are relatively infrequent, but potentially severe. Four cases of benzbromarone-induced hepatotoxicity were identified from the literature. Eleven cases have been reported by Sanofi-Synthelabo, but details are not available in the public domain. Only one of the four published cases demonstrated a clear relationship between the drug and liver injury as demonstrated by rechallenge. The other three cases lacked incontrovertible evidence to support a diagnosis of benzbromarone-induced hepatotoxicity. If all the reported cases are assumed to be due to benzbromarone, the estimated risk of hepatotoxicity in Europe was approximately 1 in 17 000 patients but may be higher in Japan.Benzbromarone is also an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and so may be involved in drug interactions with drugs dependent on this enzyme for clearance, such as warfarin. Alternative drugs to benzbromarone have significant adverse reactions. Allopurinol is associated with rare life-threatening hypersensitivity syndromes; the risk of these reactions is approximately 1 in 56 000. Rash occurs in approximately 2% of patients taking allopurinol and usually leads to cessation of prescription of the drug. Probenecid has also been associated with life-threatening reactions in a very small number of case reports, but it frequently interacts with many renally excreted drugs. Febuxostat is a new xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, which is still in clinical trials, but abnormal liver function is the most commonly reported adverse reaction.Even assuming a causal relationship between benzbromarone and hepatotoxicity in the identified cases, benefit-risk assessment based on total exposure to the drug does not support the decision by the drug company to withdraw benzbromarone from the market given the paucity of alternative options. It is likely that the risks of hepatotoxicity could be ameliorated by employing a graded dosage increase, together with regular monitoring of liver function. Determination of CYP2C9 status and consideration of potential interactions through inhibition of this enzyme should be considered. The case for wider and easier availability of benzbromarone for treating selected cases of gout is compelling, particularly for patients in whom allopurinol produces insufficient response or toxicity.We conclude that the withdrawal of benzbromarone was not in the best interest of patients with gout.""",1
13,3002687,A B-cell hybridoma product inhibiting antibody secretion via 5'-nucleotidase,"A mouse spleen cell/plasmacytoma fusion designed to generate hybridomas making monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte 5'-nucleotidase yielded three hybridomas secreting material which inhibited about 50% of human and mouse lymphocyte ecto 5'-nucleotidase activity. The inhibition proved not to be due to antibody but to material of molecular weight 44,000 +/- 7,000 which was not part of an immunoglobulin molecule, although it may be related to a B cell Fc gamma receptor. In a haemolytic plaque assay this material inhibited the production of IgG but not IgM antibody by spleen cells of mice immunized with dinitrophenylated keyhole limpit haemocyanin. By contrast, IgG production by pokeweed mitogen-stimulated human tonsillar lymphocytes (assessed by reverse haemolytic plaque assay) was partially inhibited only by ascitic fluid of one of the hybridomas. The factor was called BAN (B cell anti 5'-nucleotidase). The suppressive action of BAN on IgG production was blocked by antibodies against 5'-nucleotidase suggesting that the lymphocyte enzyme may be acting as a BAN receptor. ",0

16,19297410,Common genetic control of haemangioblast and cardiac development in zebrafish,"Over the past few years it has become clear that over half of the mammalian heart derives from outside the heart field as originally defined. Such a second heart field, however, has not been described in zebrafish, which could explain its smaller, two-chambered heart. Instead, zebrafish have a population of haemangioblasts, which is absent in mammalian embryos, raising the possibility that these cells represent the evolutionary ancestor of the second heart field. Here, we show for the first time that the genetic programmes of these anterior haemangioblasts and the adjacent heart field are co-regulated, by transcription factors previously associated with heart but not blood or endothelial development. We demonstrate that gata4, gata5 and gata6 are essential for anterior haemangioblast specification, and for subsequent myelopoiesis, acting as early as cloche and upstream of scl. The requirement for gata4, gata5 and gata6 in myeloid, endothelial and cardiac specification is in the mesoderm, but these factors also control, from within the endoderm and the yolk syncytial layer, the migration of the cardiac precursors as they differentiate. This genetic link between the blood/endothelial and cardiac programmes supports the notion that this haemangioblast population in zebrafish is an evolutionary antecedent of the second heart field, and has implications for the differentiation of haemangioblasts and cardiomyocytes from pluripotent cells, and for the origins of stem cells in the adult heart.

17,8915142,Serum type III procollagen aminopeptide for assessing liver damage in methotrexate-treated psoriatic patients,"This study was designed to establish whether measurement of a serological marker of fibrosis might reduce the need for liver biopsy in psoriatic patients receiving methotrexate (MTX). Levels of type III procollagen aminopeptide (PIIINP-O and PIIINP-B) and laminin P1 (LamP1-B) were measured in 147 serum samples taken at the time of liver biopsy in 87 patients receiving long-term MTX treatment for severe psoriasis. Biopsies were classified as: (1) normal, (2) steatosis, (3) inflammation, (4) fibrosis, or (5) cirrhosis. Groups 3-5 were considered to show clinically relevant abnormality. Compared with controls, PIIINP-O was significantly raised in the group of MTX-treated psoriatics (P < 0.001). Within this group, levels were significantly higher in patients with inflammation, fibrosis or cirrhosis compared with those with normal histology or steatosis alone (P < 0.0001). In contrast, PIIINP-B and LamP1-B did not distinguish between controls and MTX-treated patients or between histological groups. Forty-two patients had two or more biopsies with simultaneous PIIINP-O measurement. PIIINP-O levels at the time of the first biopsy were normal in six of the seven patients whose histology was initially normal and subsequently became abnormal. A single measurement of PIIINP-O thus did not predict which patients might develop abnormal histology following further MTX. In a group of 17 patients, PIIINP-O was measured 3-monthly for up to 6 years during MTX treatment. PIIINP-O was elevated at some time during follow-up in all three patients who developed abnormal histology but was consistently normal in eight of the 11 patients whose histology remained or became normal. Our findings indicate that PIIINP-O is of value in detecting liver damage and, particularly if measured serially, may reduce the need for liver biopsy in MTX-treated patients. Although the test does not detect all patients with fibrosis, it would appear that the risk of missing significant liver damage in patients with persistently normal PIIINP-O is low.",1
18,3173436,Ethical considerations of human investigation in developing countries: the AIDS dilemma,"In the efforts to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), attention has focused on sub-Saharan Africa, where large populations at risk for HIV infection could be studied easily. Cross cultural bioethics must be examined to address the ethical implications and cultural obstacles of such research. Autonomy and informed consent are difficult to achieve in cultures with limited personal choice. In some cultures, individual personhood is secondary to social relationships in the tribe or village. Language barriers, illiteracy, and the lack of knowledge about modern science all make it difficult to adequately inform participants. While the Helsinki Declaration emphasizes that a subject's well-being takes precedence over the interests of science and society, health policy decisions in nonautonomous populations often place state interests over the individual. Political sensitivities have been aroused by attempts to attribute the origin of AIDS to western or central Africa, leading political controversy and discrimination against Africans. Foreign researchers often exclude African participation once they have obtained the body fluid samples for study. Without joint collaboration and education, human research in developing countries can easily become exploitative. Justice dictates that research subjects be chosen for scientific reasons, not due to easy availability or ability to be manipulated. In vaccine development, Africans should not experience a disproportionate amount of risk without an equal share in the benefits. Furthermore, malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, and many other diseases present more urgent health problems to the developing world than AIDS. The health care priorities of the developing nations must be considered.",0
19,8938559,A case of tizanidine-induced hepatic injury,"The case history is presented of a woman who developed serious liver injury while taking 36 mg tizanidine daily. Other causes of hepatic injury were excluded. Symptoms resolved after discontinuation of tizanidine, and the liver enzyme levels were nearly normal 6 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Rechallenge with 4 mg tizanidine caused a relapse. The temporal relationship between the symptoms and liver enzyme elevations, the absence of other potential causes, and the reaction to rechallenge, strongly implicate tizanidine as the cause of hepatic injury. As we are not aware of similar case histories, this seems to be the first reported case of tizanidine-induced hepatic injury.",1
20,1846405,Hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome--a complication of dactinomycin therapy for Wilms' tumor: a report from the United Kingdom Childrens Cancer Study Group,"""We have observed hepatopathy, associated with thrombocytopenia, in children receiving chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. We have studied this hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome (HTS) in patients enrolled in the United Kingdom Childrens' Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms' tumor trials (UKW1 and UKW2). At the time of this study, 501 patients had completed therapy. Treatment flow sheets were examined for evidence of hepatopathy (hepatomegaly with abnormal liver function tests) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 25 x 10(9)/L). No child who developed the syndrome had received irradiation. HTS was seen in five of 355 (1.4%) of patients treated with combination chemotherapy but in none of the 146 patients treated with vincristine alone. In each instance, the onset was less than 10 weeks after diagnosis. In two children, hepatopathy was severe with jaundice, ascites, transaminases greater than 1,000 IU/L, and prolongation of prothrombin time. On average, HTS lasted 12 days, and resolved with supportive treatment. After recovery, the children tolerated chemotherapy, mostly at reduced dosage, without recurrence. There was no evident long-term morbidity. Dactinomycin is the probable cause of this syndrome. We conclude that the HTS is a rare but important complication of dactinomycin-containing combination chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. Children developing """"isolated"""" thrombocytopenia following dactinomycin are """"at risk"""" of developing the full-blown syndrome and should have their treatment modified accordingly.""",1

METHODS: This study compared the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear DNA determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear-encoded proteins by flow cytometry, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 HIV-infected individuals with and without risk factors for mitochondrial toxicity. RESULTS: PCR detected similar mitochondrial/nuclear DNA in HIV-infected individuals without a history of ART, and those receiving ART with lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy, or a history of suspected lactic acidosis. However, the ratio was significantly greater in ART-untreated compared to those receiving either stavudine or didanosine. In contrast, flow cytometry did not detect any differences in mitochondrial/nuclear protein (Lin et al., Cytometry B 2009;76B:181-190). There was no correlation between the assays (rho = -0.05, P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratio by qPCR performed better than the mitochondrial/nuclear-encoded protein ratio by flow cytometry to detect adverse effects of nucleoside analogs on mitochondria.""",1
24,7843705,Whole-body and segmental bioelectrical parameters in chronic liver disease: effect of gender and disease stages,"The aim of this study was to examine and compare whole-body and segmental impedance measurements in control subjects and patients with progression of liver disease and to investigate whole-body and segmental bioelectrical changes occurring during dehydration therapy or paracentesis. Males have lower resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) values than females in measurements both of the whole body and of the arm, leg, and trunk. This is not true in patients. In the three groups of patients, whole-body R and Xc were lower in each increased disease stage, suggesting that stage has a significant main effect on impedance measurements. The lower extremities were the segment most influenced by the progression of liver disease. The sum of the arm and leg R was only slightly lower than the value of whole-body resistance. The trunk has a meager influence on this parameter, as is clearly shown by the absence of variations before and immediately after paracentesis. In edematous cirrhotic patients without ascites treated with diuretics, our data also showed a significant correlation (r = .81; SEE = 1.2) between changes in body weight (BW) and in the bioelectrical evaluation of total body water (TBW). The association of a prevalent increment of Xc (approximately 40%) with a reduction of extracellular water is the most significant bioelectrical event during dehydration therapy. All these findings show that impedance measurements have a low sensitivity in detecting the volume of ascites in cirrhotic patients, whereas Xc has a clinical use in monitoring changes in extracellular water (EW).",0

Prescriptions were screened for antihypertensives at the medicine outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Medical records of the patients were scrutinized after which 286 prescriptions of patients suffering from hypertension were included. The collected data were sorted and analyzed on the basis of demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The calcium channel blockers were the most frequently used antihypertensive class of drugs (72.3%). Amlodipine (55.6%) was the single most frequently prescribed antihypertensive agent. The utilization of thiazide diuretics was 9%. Adherence to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEMs) was 65%. The combination therapy was used more frequently (51.5%) than monotherapy (48.8%). The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) was 41.4% in diabetes. The treatment pattern, in general, conformed to standard treatment guidelines. Few areas, however, need to be addressed such as the underutilization of thiazide diuretics, need for more awareness of drugs from the NLEMs and enhanced use of ACE-I/ARB in diabetic hypertensives.

26,25421567,The process of engaging members from two underserved populations in the development of interventions to promote the uptake of the HPV vaccine,"We describe a community-engaged research process used to develop multilevel interventions (caregivers, providers, system) to improve the uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine among adolescents by partnering with members from two underserved populations in Ohio. We began by conducting focus groups to better understand the knowledge and attitudes of caregivers and providers about the human papillomavirus vaccine and to develop teams of community members to assist with development of the interventions. The process continued with conducting writing sessions to determine the content and format of the interventions, and initial feedback was obtained during review sessions to refine the interventions prior to implementation. Using this approach, we were able to consider contextual factors that made the interventions more acceptable and relevant to members of the priority populations. Challenges included development and maintenance of a team of community members to participate in the entire intervention development process, rejection of ideas presented by academic researchers, the need to balance community members' suggestions with what was known from evidence-based research, and the time, cost, and effort associated with partnering with community members. The benefits, however, outweigh the challenges associated with using a community-engaged research process to develop interventions aimed at reducing cancer disparities among underserved populations.

To date, transverse myelitis as a result of dinutuximab therapy has not been reported in clinical trials or in the published literature. We describe three patients with clinical symptoms of transverse myelitis, confirmed via magnetic resonance imaging, shortly following initiation of dinutuximab. All patients were discontinued from dinutuximab treatment and received urgent treatment, with rapid improvement in symptoms and resultant functional recovery.",1
28,15386721,Risks of herbal medicinal products,"PURPOSE: Herbal medicinal products (HMPs) are again highly popular. Their current popularity renders the assessment of their safety an urgent necessity. METHOD: Narrative review using examples only. RESULTS: Constituents of HMPs can be toxic and numerous examples of liver, kidney or other organ damage are on record. All HMPs contain a range of pharmacologically active constituents, and users of HMPs often combine HMPs with prescribed drugs. Thus herb-drug interactions are a real possibility. In most countries, HMPs are not submitted to stringent regulation and control. Thus unreliable quality can be a problem. In particular, this poses a risk when HMPs are contaminated (e.g. with heavy metals) or adulterated (e.g. with prescription drugs). The medical literature holds numerous examples for all of these scenarios and some are used in this article to illustrate the above points. As this area is grossly under-researched, it is rarely possible to define the size of the problem. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the widespread notion of HMPs being inherently safe is naive at best and dangerous at worst. More research is required to minimise the risk HMPs may pose to consumers' health.",1
29,20974867,Evaluation of hepatotoxicity with off-label oral-treatment doses of voriconazole for invasive fungal infections,"""The approved treatment dose of intravenous voriconazole is a weight-based dose of 4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily; the approved oral dosing is fixed at 200 mg twice daily. In our institution, patients frequently receive oral high-dose voriconazole at 4 mg/kg twice daily. It is unknown if higher doses are associated with increased hepatotoxicity. A retrospective cohort study of patients treated with oral voriconazole for presumed invasive fungal infection for ?7 days was completed. Patients receiving a fixed dose (i.e., labeled dose) were frequency matched and compared to those receiving a weight-based dose (i.e., high dose). The primary endpoint of hepatotoxicity was evaluated by using NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) and components of liver enzymes measuring >3? the upper limit of normal (ULN) and >5? baseline measurements. Secondary endpoints included an incidence of other adverse drug events. Twenty-five labeled-dose and 84 high-dose voriconazole patients were studied. Liver enzyme abnormalities were similar between groups, with the exception of labeled-dose patients experiencing more alkaline phosphatase (ALP) CTC >2? the baseline (P = 0.02) and ALP levels >3? the ULN (P = 0.02). Treatment with high dose was associated with the discontinuation of voriconazole for practitioner attribution of adverse drug events (P = 0.03), although reasons varied and no commonality of biomarker abnormality was identified. Multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of therapy and higher mg/kg total daily doses as interval variables were predictive of some hepatotoxicity outcomes. No difference existed in liver abnormalities for high-dose voriconazole; however, higher mg/kg doses and a longer duration of therapy may be associated with hepatotoxicity.""",1
30,24312465,Low body weight in females is a risk factor for increased tenofovir exposure and drug-related adverse events,"Treatment with tenofovir sometimes leads to non-reversible kidney and/or bone diseases. Factors associated with these drug-related adverse events are poorly characterized. Our objective was to investigate such factors in patients treated long term with daily tenofovir. One-hundred Caucasian HIV-positive patients with basal creatinine clearance >80 mL/min treated with tenofovir for at least 6 months and with at least one assessment of tenofovir plasma trough concentrations were considered. Tenofovir-associated adverse events were defined as the appearance of pathological proteinuria, worsening of renal function or bone demineralization. By multivariate regression analysis, we found that serum creatinine (p = 0.003) and body weight (p = 0.002) were the factors independently associated with plasma tenofovir concentrations. In particular, women with body weight<50 kg had significantly higher plasma tenofovir concentrations than those weighting >50 Kg (160±93 vs.71±52 ng/mL, p<0.001). High tenofovir plasma trough concentrations and the age of the patients were independently associated with the development of drug-related kidney and bone toxicity. In this retrospective study we have shown that HIV-infected women with low body weight are at risk to be exposed to high tenofovir plasma trough concentrations, ultimately resulting in a significant hazard to develop long-term tenofovir complications.

31,19624990,[Stevens-Johnson syndrome plus intrahepatic cholestasis caused by clindamycin or chlorpheniramine],"A 48-year-old woman was hospitalized with the diagnosis of hepatitis. She presented with symptoms of jaundice, headache, elevated bilirubin, and elevated hepatic enzymes. She related a recent episode of a bronchial infection that was treated during the previous eight days with paracetamol (500mg, 2 doses only), chlorpheniramine, betamethasone and clindamycin. After an initial clinical and laboratorial improvement, she began to complain of pruritus of the palms and soles. Thereafter, vesicles evolving to blisters developed and a deterioration of her general health ensued. Serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative. Intrahepatic cholestasis and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) were the final diagnosis. The association of the Stevens Johnson Syndrome and intrahepatic cholestasis simultaneously, related to adverse drug reactions, is very rare. The drugs reportedly involved are mainly antibiotics, such as ampicillin, vancomycin, amoxicillin/clavulinic acid and erythromycin. Other drugs involved are non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drugs, such as mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and sulindac. The reactions can be minor or severe and can even cause death, an outcome that has been reported in patients of all races and ethnic groups, but appears to be more rare in patients of Latin origin.

Suicidality describes a broad spectrum of thoughts and behaviours, some of which are common in the general population. Although suicide results from a complex interaction of multiple social and psychological factors, predisposition to suicidality is at least partly genetic. Ordinal genome-wide association study of suicidality in the UK Biobank cohort comparing: 'no suicidality' controls (N = 83,557); 'thoughts that life was not worth living' (N = 21,063); 'ever contemplated self-harm' (N = 13,038); 'act of deliberate self-harm in the past' (N = 2498); and 'previous suicide attempt' (N = 2666). We identified three novel genome-wide significant loci for suicidality (on chromosomes nine, 11 and 13) and moderate-to-strong genetic correlations between suicidality and a range of psychiatric disorders, most notably depression (r These findings provide new information about genetic variants relating to increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

35,11124843,Hepatitis C virus infection in a community in the Nile Delta: risk factors for seropositivity,"""The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a rural village in the Nile Delta with a high prevalence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV). One half of the village households were systematically selected, tested for anti-HCV, and interviewed: 973 of 3,999 (24.3%) subjects were anti-HCV-positive (reflecting prior HCV infection but not necessarily current liver disease), with nearly equal prevalence among males and females. Anti-HCV prevalence increased sharply with age among both males and females, from 9.3% in those 20 years of age and younger to >50% in those older than 35, suggesting a cohort effect with reduced transmission in recent years. Multivariate regression was used to estimate independent effects of risk factors on seropositivity. Among those over 20 years of age, the following risk factors were significantly associated with seropositivity: age (P <.001); male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-4.7); marriage (OR = 4.1, 2.4-6.9); anti-schistosomiasis injection treatment (OR = 2.0, 1.3-2.9); blood transfusion (OR = 1.8, 1.1-2.9), invasive medical procedure (surgery, catheterization, endoscopy, and/or dialysis) (OR = 1.5, 1.1-1.9); receipt of injections from """"informal"""" health care provider (OR = 1.3, 1.0-1.6); and cesarean section or abortion (OR = 1.4, 1.0-1.9). Exposures not significantly related to anti-HCV positivity in adults included: history of, or active infection with, Schistosoma mansoni, sutures or abscess drainage, goza smoking in a group, and shaving by community barbers. Among those 20 years old or younger, no risk factors were clearly associated with anti-HCV positivity; however, circumcision for boys by informal health care providers was marginally associated with anti-HCV (OR = 1.7, 1.0-3.0).

37,20076813,Amiodarone hepatotoxicity in the context of the metabolic syndrome and right-sided heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Amiodarone is associated with varying degrees of hepatotoxicity. AIMS: to study the association between the presence of the metabolic syndrome or right-sided heart failure and the prevalence of amiodarone induced liver disease. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who received amiodarone for > or =60 days at a university affiliated community hospital. We collected information about clinical progression and liver chemistries on 409 included patients. Subgroup analysis was based on the presence or absence of right-sided heart failure and the metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: The 409 patients (58% male, 55% Caucasian) had a mean age of 62 years, mean follow up of 37.6 months and mean cumulative amiodarone dose of 295+/-404 grams. No subjects developed clinical hepatitis, cirrhosis or death related to amiodarone. Eight patients developed amiodarone hepatotoxicity, 5 required discontinuation and 3 required dose reduction of the medication with resolution of the transaminitis in all. No differences in liver chemistries at follow up between patients with or without the metabolic syndrome and with or without right cardiac dysfunction were noted. CONCLUSION: Administration of amiodarone was associated with a low incidence of hepatotoxicity without relationship to cumulative dose. The presence of the metabolic syndrome or right-sided heart failure does not increase the incidence of amiodarone hepatotoxicity.",1
38,27119237,"Oral Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma","""BACKGROUND: Ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor that is currently being studied for the treatment of multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 722 patients who had relapsed, refractory, or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (ixazomib group) or placebo plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (placebo group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ixazomib group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 14.7 months (median progression-free survival, 20.6 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the ixazomib group, 0.74; P=0.01); a benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed with the ixazomib regimen, as compared with the placebo regimen, in all prespecified patient subgroups, including in patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The overall rates of response were 78% in the ixazomib group and 72% in the placebo group, and the corresponding rates of complete response plus very good partial response were 48% and 39%. The median time to response was 1.1 months in the ixazomib group and 1.9 months in the placebo group, and the corresponding median duration of response was 20.5 months and 15.0 months. At a median follow-up of approximately 23 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either study group, and follow-up is ongoing. The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups (47% in the ixazomib group and 49% in the placebo group), as were the rates of death during the study period (4% and 6%, respectively); adverse events of at least grade 3 severity occurred in 74% and 69% of the patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia of grade 3 and grade 4 severity occurred more frequently in the ixazomib group (12% and 7% of the patients, respectively) than in the placebo group (5% and 4% of the patients, respectively). Rash occurred more frequently in the ixazomib group than in the placebo group (36% vs. 23% of the patients), as did gastrointestinal adverse events, which were predominantly low grade. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 27% in the ixazomib group and 22% in the placebo group (grade 3 events occurred in 2% of the patients in each study group). Patient-reported quality of life was similar in the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ixazomib to a regimen of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival; the additional toxic effects with this all-oral regimen were limited.

39,23735025,Treatment with adalimumab in a patient with regenerative nodular hyperplasia secondary to azathioprine,"INTRODUCTION: regenerative nodular hyperplasia (RNH) is a rare liver disease with an etiology that is not well understood. Among the etiological factors are purine-analogue drugs such asazathioprine. CASE REPORT: we present a case of a 47-year-old patient diagnosed with Crohn?s disease in treatment with azathioprine due to corticosteroid dependency who developed RNH with clinical and laboratory signs of portal hypertension one year after starting treatment. After discontinuation of azathioprine, the patient started treatment and, given the poor disease progression, started treatment with adalimumab. This was continued with an excellent response and without deleterious effects on the liver. DISCUSSION: the relevance of this case is twofold: First, this is a rare and early side effect of azathioprine treatment and this is an irreversible disease with potentially serious complications. Second, because treatment was carried out with biological drugs (adalimumab) despite the patient having advance liver disease with portal hypertension without any evidence of it worsening, nor signs of deleterious effects or complications, given that there is scarce or no experience with adalimumab treatment in this type of situation.",1

41,25092403,Molecular pathophysiology of portal hypertension,"Over the past two decades the advances in molecular cell biology have led to significant discoveries about the pathophysiology of portal hypertension (PHT). In particular, great progress has been made in the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the increased intrahepatic vascular resistance (IHVR) in cirrhosis. We now know that the increased IHVR is not irreversible, but that both the structural component caused by fibrosis and the active component caused by hepatic sinusoidal constriction can be, at least partially, reversed. Indeed, it is now apparent that the activation of perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells, which is a key event mediating the augmented IHVR, is regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways that could be potential therapeutic targets for PHT treatment. Furthermore, the complexity of the molecular physiology of PHT can also be appreciated when one considers the complex signals capable of inducing vasodilatation and hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors in the splanchnic vascular bed, with several vasoactive molecules, controlled at multiple levels, working together to mediate these circulatory abnormalities. Added to the complexity is the occurrence of pathological angiogenesis during the course of disease progression, with recent emphasis given to understanding its molecular machinery and regulation. Although much remains to be learned, with the current availability of reagents and new technologies and the exchange of concepts and data among investigators, our knowledge of the molecular basis of PHT will doubtless continue to grow, accelerating the transfer of knowledge generated by basic research to clinical practice. This will hopefully permit a better future for patients with PHT.",0
42,2294437,The long-term effects of exposure to low doses of lead in childhood. An 11-year follow-up report,"To determine whether the effects of low-level lead exposure persist, we reexamined 132 of 270 young adults who had initially been studied as primary school-children in 1975 through 1978. In the earlier study, neurobehavioral functioning was found to be inversely related to dentin lead levels. As compared with those we restudied, the other 138 subjects had had somewhat higher lead levels on earlier analysis, as well as significantly lower IQ scores and poorer teachers' ratings of classroom behavior. When the 132 subjects were reexamined in 1988, impairment in neurobehavioral function was still found to be related to the lead content of teeth shed at the ages of six and seven. The young people with dentin lead levels greater than 20 ppm had a markedly higher risk of dropping out of high school (adjusted odds ratio, 7.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 40.7) and of having a reading disability (odds ratio, 5.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 19.7) as compared with those with dentin lead levels less than 10 ppm. Higher lead levels in childhood were also significantly associated with lower class standing in high school, increased absenteeism, lower vocabulary and grammatical-reasoning scores, poorer hand-eye coordination, longer reaction times, and slower finger tapping. No significant associations were found with the results of 10 other tests of neurobehavioral functioning. Lead levels were inversely related to self-reports of minor delinquent activity. We conclude that exposure to lead in childhood is associated with deficits in central nervous system functioning that persist into young adulthood.",0

45,15073583,Expression of wild type and mutant ELOVL4 in cell culture: subcellular localization and cell viability,"ELOVL4 is a member of the fatty acid elongase (ELO) family of genes. Mutations of this gene are responsible for autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular degeneration. However, the specific role of ELOVL4 in photoreceptor cells and the mechanism by which mutations in ELOVL4 causes macular degeneration are not known. In this study we examined the subcellular localization of wild type (wt) and mutant (mt) ELOVL4 EGFP fusion protein and the potential functional consequence of mtELOVL4 expression on cell viability. Wt and mt ELOVL4 were expressed as EGFP fusion proteins in NIH 3T3 and HEK293 cells. Subcellular localizations of the fusion proteins were determined with a series of organelle-specific markers for endoplasmic reticulum (pDsRed2-ER), mitochondria (pDsRed2-Mito), peroxisomes (pDsRed2-Peroxi), and Golgi (BODIPY TR). Transfected cells were viewed using confocal and episcopic-fluorescence microscopy. Western blot analysis was performed to assess protein expression using an anti-GFP antibody. TUNEL staining was used to quantify apoptotic cell death. In cell transfection studies, wtELOVL4/EGFP fusion protein localized preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was not found to be discernibly present in mitochondria, peroxisomes, or Golgi. In contrast, the truncated mutant fusion protein (which has no ER retention signal) appeared to be mislocalized to other compartments within transfected cells. Transfected cells expressing mtELOVL4/EGFP fusion protein exhibited induction of apoptotic cell death. Unlike wtELOVL4/EGFP fusion protein, the mtELOVL4/EGFP fusion protein did not localize to the ER but rather appeared to be sequestered elsewhere in an aggregated pattern in the cytoplasm. The apoptosis induced by the mutant ELOVL4 fusion protein may be the mechanism whereby photoreceptor cells degenerate in Stargardt-like macular degeneration. Our study has provided an important in vitro model system for further assessment of ELOVL4 biochemical functions. ",0
46,193008,Cellular immunity and herpesvirus infections in cardiac-transplant patients,"We observed severe infection with herpes simplex virus in cardiac-transplant patients despite their high serum antibody levels to this virus. Therefore, we sought to correlate clinical susceptibility to two herpesvirus (simplex and zoster) infections with specific cellular immunity, assessed by the transformation and interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to heat-inactivated antigens. Transformation and interferon response to herps simplex virus was maximally depressed immediately after transplantation, the time when severe and prolonged infection with herps simplex virus occurred. Six months to six years after transplantation, both clinical susceptibility and cellular immunity to herpes simplex virus were normal. Herpes zoster infections were more frequent than normal at all times after cardiac transplantation; depressed or absent cellular responses to the varicella zoster virus paralleled that susceptibility. In these patients the risk of severe herpesvirus infections correlated with depressed cellular immune responses to the specific viral agent involved.",0
47,28597951,Regulatory T-cell conditioning endows activated effector T cells with suppressor function in autoimmune hepatitis/autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis,"Imbalance between T regulatory (Treg) and T effector (Teff) cells is likely to contribute to the induction and perpetuation of liver damage in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (AISC) either through inability of Tregs to restrain proliferation and effector cytokine production by responders or through conversion of Tregs into T helper type 1 (Th1) or type 17 (Th17) effector lymphocytes. We investigated the effect of Treg skewing on the phenotypic and functional properties of CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells, an activated subset of Teff, in 32 patients with AIH and 20 with AISC and in 36 healthy subjects. In AIH/AISC we noted a substantial increase in peripheral blood-derived CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells that display a Th1/Th17 phenotypic profile, as reflected by heightened interferon gamma and interleukin 17 (IL-17) production as well as by high levels of T-bet and related orphan receptor 3 expression, which is strongly correlated with disease activity. CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells are unresponsive to low-dose IL-2 and in patients have marked proliferative ability, further enhanced by stimulation with IL-7. CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells obtained from CD4(+) cells exposed to Treg polarizing conditions display enhanced IL-10 production; up-regulate CD49b and LAG-3, markers of T regulatory 1 cells; and effectively suppress responder cell proliferation in both healthy subjects and AIH/AISC patients through a mechanism which is dependent on interferon gamma and IL-17. The suppressive function of CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells is maintained upon proinflammatory challenge in healthy subjects but not in AIH/AISC. CONCLUSION: Treg skewing confers activated Teff phenotypic and functional properties of T regulatory 1 cells in health and in AIH/AISC, though suppressive function is lost in patients upon proinflammatory challenge; protracted modulation of the inflammatory environment is required to attenuate the effector potential while boosting immunoregulatory properties in Teff.

49,24444504,Evaluation and management of the acutely injured worker,"Approximately 3 million work-related injuries were reported by private industries in 2011, and primary care physicians provided care for approximately one out of four injured workers. To appropriately individualize the treatment of an injured worker and expedite the return to work process, primary care physicians need to be familiar with the workers' compensation system and treatment guidelines. Caring for an injured worker begins with a medical history documenting preexisting medical conditions, use of potentially impairing medications and substances, baseline functional status, and psychosocial factors. An understanding of past and current work tasks is critical and can be obtained through patient-completed forms, job analyses, and the patient's employer. Return to work in some capacity is an important part of the recovery process. It should not be unnecessarily delayed and should be an expected outcome communicated to the patient during the initial visit. Certain medications, such as opioids, may delay the return to work process, and their use should be carefully considered. Accurate and legible documentation is critical and should always include the location, date, time, and mechanism of injury.  ",0

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of flibanserin, a postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) agonist/5-HT(2A) antagonist, in premenopausal women with HSDD. METHODS: North American premenopausal women with HSDD were randomized to 24 weeks' treatment with placebo (N?=?295), flibanserin 50?mg (N?=?295), or flibanserin 100?mg (N?=?290), once daily at bedtime. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to study end in number of satisfying sexual events (SSE) and sexual desire score measured daily using an electronic diary (eDiary). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline to study end in female sexual function index (FSFI) desire domain and total scores, female sexual distress scale-revised (FSDS-R) Item 13 and total scores, and patient's global impression of improvement. RESULTS: Flibanserin 50?mg and 100?mg led to increases in SSE (P?<?0.05 and P?<?0.01 vs. placebo, respectively). There was a numerical trend toward improvement in eDiary desire score on flibanserin 100?mg, but statistical significance was not reached (P?=?0.07 vs. placebo). FSFI desire domain and total scores increased with both flibanserin regimens (P?<?0.05). FSDS-R total and Item 13 scores decreased with flibanserin 100 mg (P?<?0.001), indicating reduced sexual distress. More women receiving flibanserin 50?mg and 100?mg considered their HSDD to have improved than women receiving placebo (39.6% and 50.0% vs. 30.3%, respectively) (P?<?0.05). CONCLUSION: In premenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin 50?mg and 100?mg once daily at bedtime were well tolerated and associated with statistically significant improvements in SSE, sexual desire (FSFI desire domain score but not eDiary desire score) and overall sexual function, and reduction of sexual distress, vs. placebo.",1
51,25248593,"Alternative causes of hypopituitarism: traumatic brain injury, cranial irradiation, and infections","Hypopituitarism often remains unrecognized due to subtle clinical manifestations. Anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies may present as isolated or multiple and may be transient or permanent. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as a risk factor for hypopituitarism, most frequently presenting with isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Data analysis shows that about 15% of patients with TBI have some degree of hypopituitarism which if not recognized may be mistakenly ascribed to persistent neurologic injury and cognitive impairment. Identification of predictors for hypopituitarism after TBI is important, one of them being the severity of TBI. The mechanisms involve lesions in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and inflammatory changes in the central nervous system (CNS). With time, hypopituitarism after TBI may progress or reverse. Cranial irradiation is another important risk factor for hypopituitarism. Deficiencies in anterior pituitary hormone secretion (partial or complete) occur following radiation damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary region, the severity and frequency of which correlate with the total radiation dose delivered to the region and the length of follow-up. These radiation-induced hormone deficiencies are irreversible and progressive. Despite numerous case reports, the incidence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following infectious diseases of the CNS has been underestimated. Hypopituitarism usually relates to the severity of the disease, type of causative agent (bacterial, TBC, fungal, or viral) and primary localization of the infection. Unrecognized hypopituitarism may be misdiagnosed as postencephalitic syndrome, while the presence of a sellar mass with suprasellar extension may be misdiagnosed as pituitary macroadenoma in a patient with pituitary abscess which is potentially a life-threatening disease.

52,18330991,The effect of chitosan on the in vitro biological performance of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) blends,"Chitosan blends with synthetic biodegradable polymers have been proposed for various biomedical applications due to their versatile mechanical properties and easier processing. However, details regarding the main surface characteristics that may benefit from the blending of these two types of materials are still missing. Hence, this work aims at investigating the surface properties of chitosan-based blends, illustrating the way these properties determine the material-proteins interactions and ultimately the behavior of osteoblast-like cells. The surface characteristics of modified and nonmodified blends were assessed using complimentary techniques such as optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements and surface energy calculations. The adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) and human plasma fibronectin (HFN) onto the different surfaces was quantified by association of an indirect method with a colorimetric assay. It was found that the presence of chitosan on the surface promoted the adsorption of proteins. Moreover, a preferential adsorption of albumin over fibronectin was registered. The in vitro biological performance of the studied materials was further investigated by a direct contact assay with an osteoblastic-like cell line (SaOs-2). A synergistic effect of the two components of the blend was observed. While the synthetic polyester promoted the adhesion of SaOs-2, the presence of chitosan significantly enhanced the osteoblastic activity of these cells. This work further confirmed the interest in designing polymeric blends with natural polymers as a successful strategy to enhance the biological performance of a biomaterial. ",0

54,20360293,Statins in the treatment of dyslipidemia in the presence of elevated liver aminotransferase levels: a therapeutic dilemma,"The beneficial role of statins in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease has resulted in their frequent use in clinical practice. However, safety concerns, especially regarding hepatotoxicity, have driven multiple trials, which have demonstrated the low incidence of statin-related hepatic adverse effects. The most commonly reported hepatic adverse effect is the phenomenon known as transaminitis, in which liver enzyme levels are elevated in the absence of proven hepatotoxicity. This class effect is usually asymptomatic, reversible, and dose-related. However, the increasing incidence of chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C, has created a new challenge when initiating statin treatment in patients with high cardiovascular risk. These diseases result in abnormally high liver biochemistry values, discouraging statin use by clinicians, fostering treatment discontinuation, and leaving a large number of at-risk patients untreated. A PubMed/MEDLINE search of the literature regarding statin safety (January 1, 1994-December 31, 2008) was performed, using the following search terms: statin safety, statin-related hepatotoxicity, and chronic liver disease and statin use, as well as the specific names of different statins and different liver diseases. Relevant clinical trials, review articles, panel discussions, and guideline recommendations were selected. This review supports the use of statin treatment in patients with high cardiovascular risk whose elevated aminotransferase levels have no clinical relevance or are attributable to known stable chronic liver conditions. For each patient, the decision should be based on an individual assessment of risks and benefits.",1
55,22271545,Transcriptional regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in rat hepatic stellate cells,"Methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) are critical enzymes that catalyze the formation of the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The MAT2A gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit ?2, is induced in dedifferentiated liver. We previously demonstrated that MAT2A expression is enhanced in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and that silencing this gene reduces HSC activation. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the MAT2A gene in HSCs. We identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) response elements (PPREs) in the rat MAT2A promoter. The PPAR? agonist rosiglitazone (RSG) promoted quiescence in the activated rat HSC cell line (BSC) or culture-activated primary rat HSCs, decreased MAT2A expression and promoter activity, and enhanced PPAR? binding to MAT2A PPREs. In vivo HSC activation in bile duct-ligated rats lowered PPAR? interaction with MAT2A PPREs. Silencing PPAR? increased MAT2A transcription, whereas overexpressing it had the opposite effect, demonstrating that PPAR? negatively controls this gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of PPREs abolished PPAR? recruitment to the MAT2A promoter and its inhibitory effect on MAT2A transcription in quiescent HSCs. PPRE mutations decreased the basal promoter activity of MAT2A in activated HSCs independent of PPAR?, indicating that other factors might be involved in PPRE interaction. We identified PPAR? binding to wild-type but not to mutated PPREs in activated cells. Furthermore, silencing PPAR? inhibited MAT2A expression and promoter activity. Forced expression of MAT2A in RSG-treated HSCs lowered PPAR? and enhanced PPAR? expression, thereby promoting an activated phenotype. CONCLUSION: We identified PPAR? as a negative regulator of MAT2A in quiescent HSCs. A switch from quiescence to activation abolishes this control and allows PPAR? to up-regulate MAT2A transcription.",0
56,24400777,"Discovery of ABT-267, a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV NS5A","We describe here N-phenylpyrrolidine-based inhibitors of HCV NS5A with excellent potency, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics. Compounds with 2S,5S stereochemistry at the pyrrolidine ring provided improved genotype 1 (GT1) potency compared to the 2R,5R analogues. Furthermore, the attachment of substituents at the 4-position of the central N-phenyl group resulted in compounds with improved potency. Substitution with tert-butyl, as in compound 38 (ABT-267), provided compounds with low-picomolar EC50 values and superior pharmacokinetics. It was discovered that compound 38 was a pan-genotypic HCV inhibitor, with an EC50 range of 1.7-19.3 pM against GT1a, -1b, -2a, -2b, -3a, -4a, and -5a and 366 pM against GT6a. Compound 38 decreased HCV RNA up to 3.10 log10 IU/mL during 3-day monotherapy in treatment-naive HCV GT1-infected subjects and is currently in phase 3 clinical trials in combination with an NS3 protease inhibitor with ritonavir (r) (ABT-450/r) and an NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (ABT-333), with and without ribavirin.",1
57,7118071,Hypothesis: metabolic activity of the colonic bacteria influences organ injury from ethanol,"Incubation of human fecal homogenates with ethanol (0.078 gm per dl) resulted in accumulation of increased quantities of higher alcohols and other unidentified metabolites when compared with homogenates incubated without ethanol. Studies in rats demonstrated nearly perfect equilibration between blood and colonic luminal ethanol suggesting that the colonic flora in alcoholics is chronically exposed to ethanol concentrations in the range used in the homogenate experiments. The higher alcohols produced by the homogenates were rapidly absorbed from the colon. We hypothesize that, when exposed to ethanol, the colonic flora produced toxic compounds which are absorbed and influence the body's response to ingested ethanol. Individual differences in this bacterial metabolism may account for the wide individual differences in susceptibility to ethanol-related organ injury.",0
58,11055239,Frequency of hepatitis B virus reactivation in cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy: a prospective study of 626 patients with identification of risk factors,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a well-described complication in cancer patients who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and may result in varying degrees of liver damage. As chemotherapy is used increasingly in cancer patients, HBV reactivation during cytotoxic treatment may become a more common problem. In lymphoma patients, the incidence of chronic HBV infection has been reported to be 26%, of whom 47% developed HBV reactivation during chemotherapy. However, corresponding data for patients with other malignancies undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy are not known. In this prospective study, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was determined in 626 consecutive cancer patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy over a 12-month period. Seventy-eight patients (12%) were found to be HBsAg positive. Thirty-four (44%) developed raised alanine transaminase during their course of chemotherapy. In these 34 patients, hepatitis was attributed to HBV reactivation in 15 patients (44%), chronic active HBV infection in 1 patient (3%), hepatitis C infection in 1 patient (3%), malignant hepatic infiltration in 2 patients (6%), and the use of hepatotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in 11 patients (32%). The causes of hepatitis were unknown in 4 patients (12%). HBV reactivation was more likely to develop in patients who were male, younger age, HBeAg seropositive, and those with lymphoma. Presence of malignant hepatic infiltration, baseline pre-treatment alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, and HBV DNA levels did not correlate with the development of HBV reactivation. Of the 15 patients who developed HBV reactivation, antiviral therapy with lamivudine was available and used in 9. There was no HBV-related mortality during chemotherapy. It is concluded that in patients with chronic HBV infection under chemotherapy, HBV reactivation occurs in nearly 20% of them and accounts for 44% of hepatitis cases. The risk factors identified include male sex, younger age, HBeAg seropositive, and the diagnosis of lymphoma. In HBV endemic areas, patients with risk factors for HBV reactivation should be identified prior to receiving cytotoxic treatment and monitored closely. The potential benefit of lamivudine requires further confirmation.",1
59,23633659,Transcription factor Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense system in the development of diabetic retinopathy,"Increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the major retinal metabolic abnormalities associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a redox sensitive factor, provides cellular defenses against the cytotoxic ROS. In stress conditions, Nrf2 dissociates from its cytosolic inhibitor, Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and moves to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of antioxidant genes including the catalytic subunit of glutamylcysteine ligase (GCLC), a rate-limiting reduced glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis enzyme. Our aim is to understand the role of Nrf2-Keap1-GCLC in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Effect of diabetes on Nrf2-Keap1-GCLC pathway, and subcellular localization of Nrf2 and its binding with Keap1 was investigated in the retina of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The binding of Nrf2 at GCLC was quantified by chromatin immunoprecipitation technique. The results were confirmed in isolated retinal endothelial cells, and also in the retina from human donors with diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes increased retinal Nrf2 and its binding with Keap1, but decreased DNA-binding activity of Nrf2 and also its binding at the promoter region of GCLC. Similar impairments in Nrf2-Keap1-GCLC were observed in the endothelial cells exposed to high glucose and in the retina from donors with diabetic retinopathy. In retinal endothelial cells, glucose-induced impairments in Nrf2-GCLC were prevented by Nrf2 inducer tBHQ and also by Keap1-siRNA. Due to increased binding of Nrf2 with Keap1, its translocation to the nucleus is compromised contributing to the decreased GSH levels. Thus, regulation of Nrf2-Keap1 by pharmacological or molecular means could serve as a potential adjunct therapy to combat oxidative stress and inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy. ",0
60,24986342,DSM-5 and neurocognitive disorders,"The newest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) introduces several changes in the diagnostic criteria for dementia and other cognitive disorders. Some of these changes may prove helpful for clinical and forensic practitioners, particularly when evaluating less severe cognitive impairments. The most substantial change is that the cognitive disorder-not otherwise specified category found in prior editions has been eliminated. Those disorders that do not cause sufficient impairment to qualify for a diagnosis of dementia are now defined as neurocognitive disorders and placed on a spectrum with the more severe conditions. The concept of social cognition is also introduced as one of the core functional domains that can be affected by a neurocognitive disorder. This concept may be particularly significant in the evaluation of patients with non-Alzheimer's dementias, such as frontotemporal dementia. With the aging of the population and the increasing recognition of the possibility of long-lasting cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury, the need for assessment of cognitive disorders in medicolegal contexts is certain to increase. Forensic psychiatrists who perform these evaluations should understand the conceptualization of Neurocognitive Disorders as presented in DSM-5 and how it differs from prior diagnostic systems.  ",0
61,20578145,Activation of Rac1 promotes hedgehog-mediated acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype in rat and human hepatic stellate cells,"Hepatic accumulation of myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells (MF-HSCs) is pivotal in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis. Two events are necessary for MF-HSCs to accumulate in damaged livers: transition of resident, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSCs) to MF-HSCs and expansion of MF-HSC numbers through increased proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. In this study, we identified two novel mediators of MF-HSC accumulation: Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and Hedgehog (Hh). It is unclear whether Rac1 and Hh interact to regulate the accumulation of MF-HSCs. We evaluated the hypothesis that Rac1 promotes activation of the Hh pathway, thereby stimulating signals that promote transition of Q-HSCs into MF-HSCs and enhance the viability of MF-HSCs. Using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, Rac1 activity was manipulated through adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of constitutively active or dominant-negative rac1. Rac1-transgenic mice with targeted myofibroblast expression of a mutated human rac1 transgene that produces constitutively active Rac1 were also examined. Results in all models demonstrated that activating Rac1 in HSC enhanced Hh signaling, promoted acquisition/maintenance of the MF-HSC phenotype, increased MF-HSC viability, and exacerbated fibrogenesis. Conversely, inhibiting Rac1 with dominant-negative rac1 reversed these effects in all systems examined. Pharmacologic manipulation of Hh signaling demonstrated that profibrogenic actions of Rac1 were mediated by its ability to activate Hh pathway-dependent mechanisms that stimulated myofibroblastic transition of HSCs and enhanced MF-HSC viability. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that interactions between Rac1 and the Hh pathway control the size of MF-HSC populations and have important implications for the pathogenesis of cirrhosis.",0

63,16007524,The hepatotoxicity of antifungal medications in bone marrow transplant recipients,"""BACKGROUND: Systemic antifungal medications can be lifesaving but can also have important toxicities. With a number of new antifungal drugs being introduced, there is a compelling need to define the toxicities associated with existing therapies. METHODS: We identified cases of hepatotoxicity among patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation and selected matched control subjects from the same population. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to control for patient characteristics in evaluating the relationship between hepatotoxicity and exposure to antifungal medications. Follow-up analyses were performed for patients who continued receiving antifungal medications after developing hepatotoxicity. RESULTS: The unadjusted incidence of hepatotoxicity was 0.78 cases per 100 patient-days of exposure to amphotericin deoxycholate, 0.98 for fluconazole, and 1.50 for liposomal amphotericin B. Case-control analyses found that liposomal amphotericin B was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity in these patients (odds ratio [OR], 3.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-6.88); a smaller increase in risk was found for fluconazole (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.21-3.26). There was no statistically significant association between amphotericin B deoxycholate and the development of hepatotoxicity. Patients had greater elevations of serum transaminase values associated with exposure to larger cumulative doses of liposomal amphotericin B. In the follow-up analysis of patients who developed hepatotoxicity and who continued receiving antifungal medication, one-third of those receiving liposomal amphotericin B had marked increases in bilirubin levels, as opposed to 8% of patients treated with fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In these bone marrow transplant recipients, liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole were both associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity, independent of other treatments received or patient characteristics; the magnitude of the risk was larger for liposomal amphotericin B. Patients who develop hepatotoxicity appear to tolerate continued therapy with fluconazole, but a large fraction of those who received liposomal amphotericin B have worsening conditions with continued treatment.""",1

65,1775085,How do androgens affect episodic gonadotrophin secretion in postmenopausal women?,"In the absence of any significant ovarian oestrogen secretion, as in post-menopausal women, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may still be influenced by the androgens which continue to be produced. The episodic secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by postmenopausal women was accordingly assessed following short-term androgen antagonism induced by flutamide, a specific androgen receptor blocker. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 10 h in nine women before and during flutamide administration (750 mg/day for 6 days) for the determination of gonadotrophin and sex hormone concentrations by radioimmunoassay. On both occasions, 25 micrograms of gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) was injected intravenously 8 h after initiation of the blood collections. Flutamide administration decreased (P less than 0.01 or less) androgen concentrations (testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) in relation to baseline values, but did not alter oestrogen (oestrone and oestradiol) or sex-hormone-binding globulin levels. The LH and FSH pulse characteristics (frequency, amplitude, interpulse interval and transverse mean levels) determined by a cluster algorithm in the gonadotrophin secretory profiles did not differ before and during androgen blockade. By contrast, androgen antagonism increased LH (P less than 0.01) and tended to enhance FSH (P = 0.10) FSH release in response to GnRH stimulation. Hence, short-term androgen receptor blockade with flutamide did not greatly affect episodic gonadotrophin secretion. However, the combined evidence of the enhanced gonadotrophin release observed in response to GnRH stimulation and the unchanged gonadotrophin secretion during androgen antagonism suggests that alterations in the magnitude, but not the frequency, of hypothalamic GnRH release had occurred. Even in the presence of substantial serum androgen concentrations, the gonadotrophin pulse rhythm in hypogonadal women constitutes the maximal-rate GnRH-LH release pattern. ",0

68,17132810,Febuxostat: a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trial data, safety profile, precautions, and place in therapy of febuxostat, a novel nonpurine xanthine oxidase inhibitor in development for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. DATA SOURCES: Available studies and abstracts were identified through MEDLINE (1990-November 2006), Science Citation Index, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Databases, and the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism Web sites. Key search terms were febuxostat, TMX-67, TEI-6720, hyperuricemia, and gout. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available studies describing the pharmacology of febuxostat were included. Human studies formed the basis for discussion of clinical parameters, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of febuxostat. DATA SYNTHESIS: Febuxostat significantly reduces uric acid levels within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and up to 48% by the end of 104 weeks of therapy. Approximately 60% of patients achieved the primary goal of serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL during the last 3 months following once-daily administration of febuxostat 80 mg or 120 mg for at least 52 weeks. The most common adverse reactions to febuxostat were abnormal results from liver function tests, diarrhea, headache, arthralgias, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Due to its potency, patients are at an increased risk of experiencing gout flares for at least the first year of therapy. Up to 70% of patients in clinical trials experienced gout flares despite concomitant prophylactic treatment with colchicine or naproxen. Additional clinical trial evidence supports the efficacy and safety of febuxostat in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. CONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat is a promising alternative to allopurinol for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. The optimal length of prophylactic therapy, clinical significance of abnormal liver function tests results during therapy, and safety in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency warrant further investigation.",1
69,10800057,The effect of busulphan on the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its 4-hydroxy metabolite: time interval influence on therapeutic efficacy and therapy-related toxicity,"""Busulphan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/CP) are widely used in preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation. Many studies have shown a wide variation in busulphan pharmacokinetics. Moreover, higher rates of liver toxicity were reported in Bu/CP protocols than in a total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen. In the present paper we investigated the effect of the time interval between the last dose of busulphan and the first dose of cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of CP and its cytotoxic metabolite 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP). Thirty-six patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were included in the study. We also investigated the occurrence of veno-occlusive disease, mucositis and graft-versus-host disease. Ten patients conditioned with CP followed by TBI served as a control group (TBI). Twenty-six patients were conditioned with Bu/CP. The patients received Bu (1 mg/kg x 4 for 4 days), followed by CP (60 mg/kg for 2 days) administered as a 1-h infusion. Patients received their CP therapy either 7-15 h (group A, n = 12) or 24-50 h (group B, n = 14) after the last dose of Bu. None of the patients were given phenytoin or any other drug known to enhance CP metabolism. The administration of CP less than 24 h after the last dose of Bu resulted in: (1) a significantly (P = 0.003) lower clearance for cyclophosphamide was observed in group A (0.036 l/h/kg) compared to 0.055 and 0.055 l/h/kg, in the B and TBI groups, respectively; (2) significantly (P = 0.002) longer elimination half-life in group A (10.93 h) than in groups B and TBI (6.87 and 7.52 h, respectively); (3) significantly (P < 0.001) lower exposure to the cytotoxic metabolite (4-OHCP), expressed as the ratio AUC4-OHCP/AUCCP, in group A (0.0053) than that obtained in group B (0.013) and group TBI (0.012); (4) the patients in group A had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher incidence of VOD (seven of 12) than the other groups, B and TBI (2/14 and 1/10, respectively); and (5) mucositis was significantly higher in group A patients (8/12), being seen in only one patient in group B and none in the TBI group. The present study has shown that the interval between busulphan and cyclophosphamide administration can negatively affect the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its cytotoxic metabolite. We conclude that the timing of CP administration must be considered in order to improve drug efficacy and reduce conditioning-related toxicity.""",1

We describe a case of acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive elderly patient following administration of indomethacin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old HCV-positive man was hospitalized for severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, 15 days after starting indomethacin for back pain. Clinical signs and imaging evaluations disclosed a picture of PVT. Indomethacin was discontinued, and the patient was started on fondaparinux and antithrombin. He was discharged 15 days later due to improvement of his clinical conditions. Thirty days later, a follow-up ultrasound did not show appreciable signs of PVT. The time elapsing between the start of analgesic therapy and PVT onset suggests a role of indomethacin as the triggering agent. Indomethacin could have precipitated PVT by a combination of at least two detrimental mechanisms: 1) direct action on liver vascular endothelium by inhibition of prostacyclin biosynthesis; 2) damage to the intestinal mucosa, followed by inflammatory and pro-coagulant activation of portal endothelium upon exposure to bacterial endotoxins. CONCLUSIONS: This case can be of interest to physicians, who should exert caution when prescribing NSAIDs for inflammatory pain in patients with background inflammatory dysfunctions of the portal vein endothelium.""",1

Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment assignment, but the independent central imaging review group were. Treatment continued until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by independent central review (intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01121393. FINDINGS: 910 patients were screened and 364 were randomly assigned (242 to afatinib, 122 to gemcitabine and cisplatin). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the afatinib group (11?0 months, 95% CI 9?7-13?7) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (5?6 months, 5?1-6?7; hazard ratio 0?28, 95% CI 0?20-0?39; p<0?0001). The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the afatinib group were rash or acne (35 [14?6%] of 239 patients), diarrhoea (13 [5?4%]), and stomatitis or mucositis (13 [5?4%]), compared with neutropenia (30 [26?5%] of 113 patients), vomiting (22 [19?5%]), and leucopenia (17 [15?0%]) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 15 (6?3%) patients in the afatinib group and nine (8?0%) patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. INTERPRETATION: First-line afatinib significantly improves progression-free survival with a tolerable and manageable safety profile in Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced lung NSCLC. Afatinib should be considered as a first-line treatment option for this patient population. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.""",1
73,2563951,Coated mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) versus sulphasalazine in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a randomised trial,"""OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of a preparation of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) coated with a pH dependent resin (Eudragit L) as compared with sulphasalazine in patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Eight week randomised double blind parallel group study. SETTING: Forty six gastroenterology outpatient clinics in seven countries. PATIENTS: Two hundred and twenty patients aged 18-70 who met the following criteria: clinical activity index greater than or equal to 6 and endoscopic index greater than or equal to 4; no concomitant treatment for ulcerative colitis; no hypersensitivity to salicylates or sulphonamides. Of the 164 patients eligible for efficacy analysis, 87 received the coated preparation of mesalazine and 77 sulphasalazine. Most of the remaining patients (28 in each group) were ineligible for the efficacy analysis because of treatment with steroid enemas. All pretrial characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups. INTERVENTIONS: Coated mesalazine (Mesasal) 1.5 g daily or sulphasalazine 3.0 g daily for eight weeks. Compliance monitored by pill counts. END POINT: Clinical and endoscopic remission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical activity measured by daily diary cards, assessment by investigators, and laboratory findings. Endoscopic evaluation at week 8. After four weeks 50 of 70 patients (71%) taking coated mesalazine and 38 of 58 (66%) taking sulphasalazine had achieved remission of their disease by eight weeks remission rates were 74% (37/50 patients) and 81% (35/43) in the two treatment groups respectively. Endoscopic remission at eight weeks was recorded in 20 of 41 patients (49%) taking coated mesalazine and 18 of 38 (47%) taking sulphasalazine. There was a higher incidence of adverse events among patients taking sulphasalazine (25/105; 24%) than among those taking coated mesalazine (16/115; 14%). CONCLUSION: Mesalazine coated with Eudragit L is a safe, logical alternative to sulphasalazine.""",1
74,28089559,Microglia-derived neuregulin expression in psychiatric disorders,"Several studies have revealed that neuregulins (NRGs) are involved in brain function and psychiatric disorders. While NRGs have been regarded as neuron- or astrocyte-derived molecules, our research has revealed that microglia also express NRGs, levels of which are markedly increased in activated microglia. Previous studies have indicated that microglia are activated in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, we investigated microglial NRG mRNA expression in multiple lines of mice considered models of ASD. Intriguingly, microglial NRG expression significantly increased in BTBR and socially-isolated mice, while maternal immune activation (MIA) mice exhibited identical NRG expression to controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between NRG expression in microglia and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in mice, suggesting that NRG expression in human PBMCs may mirror microglia-derived NRG expression in the human brain. To translate these findings for application in clinical psychiatry, we measured levels of NRG1 splice-variant expression in clinically available PBMCs of patients with ASD. Levels of NRG1 type III expression in PBMCs were positively correlated with impairments in social interaction in children with ASD (as assessed using the Autistic Diagnostic Interview-Revised test: ADI-R). These findings suggest that immune cell-derived NRGs may be implicated in the pathobiology of psychiatric disorders such as ASD. ",0
75,10370994,A new method of three-dimensional computer assisted reconstruction of the developing biliary tract,"A three-dimensional (3-D) computer assisted reconstruction of the biliary tract was performed in human and rat embryos at Carnegie stage 23 to describe and compare the biliary structures and to point out the anatomic relations between the structures of the hepatic pedicle. Light micrograph images from consecutive serial sagittal sections (diameter 7 mm) of one human and 16 rat embryos were directly digitalized with a CCD camera. The serial views were aligned automatically by software. The data were analysed following segmentation and thresholding, allowing automatic reconstruction. The main bile ducts ascended in the mesoderm of the hepatoduodenal ligament. The extrahepatic bile ducts: common bile duct (CD), cystic duct and gallbladder in the human, formed a compound system which could not be shown so clearly in histologic sections. The hepato-pancreatic ampulla was studied as visualised through the duodenum. The course of the CD was like a chicane. The gallbladder diameter and length were similar to those of the CD. Computer-assisted reconstruction permitted easy acquisition of the data by direct examination of the sections through the microscope. This method showed the relationships between the different structures of the hepatic pedicle and allowed estimation of the volume of the bile duct. These findings were not obvious in two-dimensional (2-D) views from histologic sections. Each embryonic stage could be rebuilt in 3-D, which could introduce the time as a fourth dimension, fundamental for the study of organogenesis. ",0
76,7811210,Service-mix provided to patients in Australian private practice,"Service-mix can reflect changes in demographic factors, oral health, patient demand and treatment philosophies. The aim of this study was to compare service-mix by patient age in 1988 with baseline data from 1983. A weighted, stratified random sample of dentists in Australia was surveyed by mailed questionnaire in 1983 and again in 1988. Service-mix was dominated by restorative, diagnostic and preventive areas. Comparing 1988 with 1983, there were significant increases for diagnostic, preventive, advanced restorative, orthodontic and general areas. Patterns across patient age groups and between years indicated younger patients were being provided with increased preventive services (patients aged 5-11, 25-44 years) and decreased restorative services (patients aged 5-11, 12-17 years), while older patients were being provided with reduced prosthodontic services (patients aged 25-44, 45-64 years), but increased restorative services (patients aged 45-64, 65+ years) and advanced restorative services (patients aged 25-44, 45-64 years). These patterns of service-mix have implications for dental education, research and service delivery. ",0

78,3000642,Enhancement by norepinephrine of automaticity in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers exposed to hypoxic glucose-free Tyrode's solution: a role for alpha-adrenoceptors?,"A period of drive in the presence of norepinephrine (NE) may be followed by the induction or acceleration of spontaneous activity. Experiments were carried out in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers to determine whether the effects of NE on automaticity were modified during superfusion with hypoxic glucose-free Tyrode's solution and to assess the possible contribution of alpha-adrenergic influences on automaticity under these conditions. The following results were obtained: Low concentrations of NE (10(-7) and 3 X 10(-7)M) were able to induce automaticity after a period of drive in normal oxygenated (97% O2, 3% CO2) Tyrode's solution. Superfusion with hypoxic (97% N2, 3% CO2) glucose-free Tyrode's solution enhanced NE-induced automaticity. Practolol, in concentrations able to block the effects of NE in normal oxygenated solution, did not counteract the effects of NE in hypoxic glucose-free solution. Yohimbine, but not prazosin, antagonized the effects of NE in hypoxic glucose-free solution. At the same concentration, yohimbine did not affect transmembrane potentials or automaticity induced by isoproterenol. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic responsiveness appears to be enhanced during superfusion in vitro with hypoxic glucose-free solution, and that alpha-adrenoceptors belonging to the alpha 2-subtype in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers might influence abnormal automaticity, possibly through an effect on oscillatory potentials.

79,29178011,"Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsies: an observational study on clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic features in a pediatric cohort","""The aim of our study was to describe the clinical, electroencephalogram, molecular findings and the diagnostic and therapeutic flow-chart of children with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsies (PDEs). We performed a retrospective observational study on children with PDEs, diagnosed and followed-up in Italian Pediatric Departments. In each centre, the authors collected data from a cohort of children admitted for intractable seizures, responsive to pyridoxine administration and resistant to other anticonvulsant therapies. Data were retrospectively analysed from January 2016 to January 2017. Sixteen patients (13 males, and 3 females) were included. We found that 93.75% of patients underwent conventional anticonvulsant therapy before starting pyridoxine administration and 62.5% had ex-juvantibus diagnosis, as specific serum diagnostic tests had been performed in only 37.5% of patients by alpha-AASA and pipecolic acid blood and urine dosage. The most common type of seizure was generalized tonic-clonic in 7 patients and the most common EEG pattern was characterized by a """"burst suppression"""" pattern. Before pyridoxine administration, other anticonvulsant drugs were used in 93.75% of patients, with consequent onset of drug-resistance. Phenobarbital was the most frequently used drug as first-line treatment. The importance of our study relies on the need of a deeper knowledge of PDEs in terms of early diagnosis, avoiding incorrect treatment and related adverse events, clinical and EEG pathognomonic features, and genetic aspects of the disease.

80,7557879,Differential expression of A and B laminin chains during rat liver regeneration,"We have studied the distribution and expression of laminin during rat liver regeneration by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting using affinity-purified laminin antibodies. Laminin was localized on sinusoidal surfaces in normal and regenerating hepatic parenchyma, but enhanced expression was detected during regeneration from 6 hours to 7 days after a partial hepatectomy. A and B laminin chains were specifically detected by Western blotting in highly purified plasma membrane fractions derived from the sinusoidal domain of hepatocytes. Analysis of laminin expression in whole homogenates from hepatectomized rats showed a differential expression of A and B laminin chains during regeneration: The A chain showed a progressive increase, whereas the B chain exhibited an early, prereplicative increase and then gradually declined to control levels at the end of restorative growth. The results suggest differential temporal requirements for A and B laminin chains during hepatic growth and tissue formation.",0
81,15051420,Protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells by scutellarin,"The present study investigated the protective actions of the antioxidant scutellarin against the cytotoxicity produced by exposure to H2O2 in PC12 cells. This was done by assaying for MTT (3,(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) reduction and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ in cells were evaluated by fluorescent microplate reader using DCFH and Fura 2-AM, respectively, as probes. Lipid peroxidation was quantified using thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed by the retention of rhodamine123 (Rh123), a specific fluorescent cationic dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria, depending on their transmembrane potential. The DNA content and percentage of apoptosis were monitored with flow cytometry. Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, was employed as a comparative agent. Preincubation of PC12 cells with scutellarin prevented cytotoxicity induced by H2O2. Intracellular accumulation of ROS, Ca2+ and products of lipid peroxidation, resulting from H2O2 were significantly reduced by scutellarin. Incubation of cells with H2O2 caused a marked decrease in MMP, which was significantly inhibited by scutellarin. PC12 cells treated with H2O2 underwent apoptotic death as determined by flow cytometric assay. The percentage of this H2O2-induced apoptosis in the cells was decreased in the presence of different concentrations of scutellarin. Scutellarin exhibited significantly higher potency compared to the antioxidant vitamin E. The present findings showed that scutellarin attenuated H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, intracellular accumulation of ROS and Ca2+, lipid peroxidation, and loss of MMP and DNA, which may represent the cellular mechanisms for its neuroprotective action.

82,9828215,Primary rat and mouse hepatic stellate cells express the macrophage inhibitor cytokine interleukin-10 during the course of activation In vitro,"Activation of local tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) and of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to a myofibroblast phenotype are two key events in liver inflammation and fibrosis. It is known that products of activated macrophages may activate stellate cells. We have hypothesized that the products of activated HSCs may also modulate the activity of Kupffer cells. The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), produced by lymphocytes and macrophages, has profound inhibitory actions on macrophages. Normal rat and mouse HSCs that differentiate in vivo and in vitro to activated myofibroblasts were isolated by enzyme perfusion and density centrifugation with or without centrifugal elutriation, confirmed by vitamin A autofluorescence and positive immunostaining for the myofibroblast markers desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Conditioned media and lysates from these cells were found to down-regulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) secretion by the mouse macrophage line RAW 267.4. In highly purified preparations of rat HSCs, messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-10 was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), from the time of isolation to up to 120 days of culture on plastic. Long-term cultures of unstimulated mouse HSCs secreted IL-10 protein as detected by immunoblotting and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL-10 protein was undetectable by immunohistochemistry in mouse HSCs for the first 3 days in culture. After this, the percentage of IL-10-positive cells increased to 45% at day 7 and 100% by day 14, and expression of IL-10 continued in long-term cultures of up to 120 days. The expression of IL-10 by the stromal cells that govern the fibrotic process in the liver may have important implications for the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver.",0

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of pramlintide as an antiobesity agent, we assessed the weight effect, safety, and tolerability of pramlintide in non-insulin-treated obese subjects with and without type 2 diabetes at doses greater than previously studied. DESIGN/SETTING: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. PATIENTS: A total of 204 obese subjects [80/20% female/male, age 48 +/- 10 yr, and body mass index 37.8 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2) (mean +/- SD)] participated in the study. INTERVENTION: For 16 wk, without concomitant lifestyle intervention, subjects self-administered pramlintide (nonforced dose escalation < or = 240 microg) or placebo via sc injection three times a day before meals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, waist circumference, tolerability, and safety were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Pramlintide was generally well tolerated, with 88% of subjects able to escalate to the maximum dose of 240 microg. Withdrawal rates were similar between placebo (25%) and pramlintide-treated subjects (29%). Subjects completing 16 wk of pramlintide treatment experienced placebo-corrected reductions in body weight of 3.7 +/- 0.5% (3.6 +/- 0.6 kg; P < 0.001) and waist circumference (3.6 +/- 1.1 cm; P < 0.01). Approximately 31% of pramlintide-treated subjects achieved > or =5% weight loss (vs. 2% placebo; P < 0.001). More pramlintide than placebo-treated subjects reported improvements in appetite control (72% vs. 31%), weight control (63% vs. 24%), and overall well-being (52% vs. 17%). No unexpected safety signals were observed. The most common adverse event reported was mild, transient nausea. Pramlintide-treated subjects not reporting nausea experienced weight loss similar to those who did (3.6 +/- 0.5% and 3.9 +/- 0.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results support continued evaluation of pramlintide as a potential treatment for obesity.""",1

86,7074302,Pupil studies in depressed patients: an investigation of the mechanism of action of desipramine,"Six depressed patients were treated routinely with desipramine, a relatively selective noradrenergic uptake blocking drug. After 0, 1 and 3 weeks' treatment, pupillary responses to tyramine, phenylephrine and pilocarpine were measured using a photographic techniques. Both 1 and 3 weeks' treatment significantly inhibited tyramine and phenylephrine-induced mydriasis, but did not inhibit pilocarpine-induced miosis; in fact the longer treatment enhanced miosis due to pilocarpine. Resting pupil size was significantly increased after 1 and 3 weeks' treatment. The findings can be explained by the known ability of desipramine to block noradrenaline uptake and alpha adrenoceptors: they provide no evidence of muscarinic receptor blockade or of a slowly developing adaptation at alpha adrenoceptors.

87,15053703,Perceived discrimination and substance use in African American parents and their children: a panel study,"The relation between perceived racial discrimination and substance use was examined in a panel of 684 African American families, using the prototype-willingness model of adolescent health risk (F. X. Gibbons, M. Gerrard, & D. Lane, 2003). Discrimination was concurrently and prospectively related to use in the parents and the children (mean age=10.5 years at Wave 1). The discrimination-->use relation in the parents was mediated by distress (anxiety and depression). Among the children, the relation was mediated by distress as well as their risk cognitions (favorability of their risk images and their willingness to use) and the extent to which they reported affiliating with friends who were using substances. Each of these relations with discrimination was positive. In contrast, effective parenting was associated with less willingness and intention to use. Theoretical and applied implications of the results are discussed. ",0

90,8591845,The effect of mannitol and secretin on the biliary transport of urate in humans,"No evidence is available on the transport of biliary urate and the possible role of choleretic agents in the regulation of biliary urate elimination in humans. To test this hypothesis we studied the following: (1) 45 cholecystomized patients to determine urate levels in hepatic bile and gallbladder bile, and (2) 13 cholecystomized patients fitted with T-tubes to determine the effects of secretin injection (either 70 U of porcine secretin or 0.02 mg.kg-1 of synthetic human secretin, as a single dose) and/or mannitol infusion (5 cm3.min-1 for 90 minutes) on biliary urate excretion. In the latter group, samples of bile and serum were analyzed for urate under basal state and after the administration of both agents. In our first approach, results showed that urate concentrations present in hepatic as well as in gallbladder bile were much lower than the corresponding values in serum (P < .001). The mean gallbladder bile urate concentration was not significantly increased over the concentration in hepatic bile. When compared with basal state values, procine and synthetic secretin induced a significant increase in mean urate clearance (P < .001) because of a significant increase in mean bile flow (P < .001), whereas the mean biliary urate concentration significantly decreased (P < .001) with a concomitant decrease in the mean serum urate concentration (P < .02). Mannitol also induced a significant increase in the mean urate clearance (P < .002) because of a significant increase in the mean biliary urate concentration (P < .01) with a concomitant decrease in the mean serum urate concentration (P < .01) and without changes in the mean bile flow (P > .05). Therefore, it appears that a substantial amount of urate is eliminated by biliary route. The load of biliary urate excreted may be modified by mannitol and secretin and possibly other factors, a finding that could have an application in some pathological conditions associated with decreased renal urate excretion.",0
91,23647117,Ozone photolysis of paracetamol in aqueous solution,"The degradation of a paracetamol (N-acetil-para-aminofenol) aqueous solution (C (0) P = 5 mmol L(-1)) is studied in a bench-scale setup by means of simple ozonation (O3) and ozonation catalyzed with UV light (O3/UV) in order to quantify the influence of UV light on the degradation process. The results have shown that under the adopted experimental conditions (25°C, applied ozone dose = 9.8 mg L(-1) and gas flow rate of 20 L h(-1)) both oxidative systems are capable of removing the substrate with mineralization degrees up to 51% for ozonation and 53% for O3/UV. HPICE chromatography allowed the detection of nitrate ions and maleic and oxalic acids as ultimate carboxylic acids. The experimental data have been interpreted through 5 indicators: the conversion of paracetamol (XP ), the conversion degree of TOC (XTOC ), the apparent rate constant (kap ), the Hatta number (Ha) and the enhancement factor (E). The main advantage of photo-ozonation compared to simple ozonation was a more advanced conversion (79% vs. 92% after 90 min). The paracetamol decay follows a pseudo-first-order reaction with a superior rate constant (higher by 54%) for the UV catalyzed system in comparison with direct ozonation. Mineralization is slightly accelerated (+4%) in the O3/UV system, due to the additional production of hydroxyl radicals induced by the UV light and a higher Hatta number (+24%). Nevertheless, the process was still in the slow reaction kinetic regime (Ha < 0.3), and the enhancement factor was not significantly increased. The results are useful for the design and scale-up of the gas-liquid processes. ",0
92,21932398,Conjugated bile acids activate the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 in primary rodent hepatocytes,"Bile acids have been shown to be important regulatory molecules for cells in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. They can activate various cell signaling pathways including extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and protein kinase B (AKT) as well as the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) membrane-type bile acid receptor (TGR5/M-BAR). Activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways by conjugated bile acids has been reported to be sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) and dominant-negative G?(i) in primary rodent hepatocytes. However, the GPCRs responsible for activation of these pathways have not been identified. Screening GPCRs in the lipid-activated phylogenetic family (expressed in HEK293 cells) identified sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P(2) ) as being activated by taurocholate (TCA). TCA, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and S1P-induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT were significantly inhibited by JTE-013, a S1P(2) antagonist, in primary rat hepatocytes. JTE-013 significantly inhibited hepatic ERK1/2 and AKT activation as well as short heterodimeric partner (SHP) mRNA induction by TCA in the chronic bile fistula rat. Knockdown of the expression of S1P(2) by a recombinant lentivirus encoding S1P(2) shRNA markedly inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT by TCA and S1P in rat primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes prepared from S1P(2) knock out (S1P(2) (-/-) ) mice were significantly blunted in the activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways by TCA. Structural modeling of the S1P receptors indicated that only S1P(2) can accommodate TCA binding. In summary, all these data support the hypothesis that conjugated bile acids activate the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways primarily through S1P(2) in primary rodent hepatocytes.",0
93,7694896,Lipoylated and unlipoylated domains of human PDC-E2 as autoantigens in primary biliary cirrhosis: significance of lipoate attachment,"Approximately 95% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have antimitochondrial antibodies against the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E2p). Immunodominant sites on E2p have been localized to the inner lipoyl domain, which serves as a covalent attachment site for the essential cofactor, lipoic acid. However, it is not clear whether the presence of lipoic acid is necessary for autoimmune recognition of human E2p. To facilitate further studies on the inner lipoyl domain and to assess the importance of lipoic acid in antibody binding, we used the previously cloned human E2p cDNA in the construction and high-level expression in Escherichia coli of a subgene encoding the domain. Purification and analysis of the gene product revealed that both lipoylated and unlipoylated forms of the intact domain are generated. Immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition experiments and antibody affinity measurements using isolated lipoylated and unlipoylated domains demonstrated that the presence of the lipoyl residue is crucial for effective recognition by primary biliary cirrhosis patients' autoantibodies, which have a higher relative affinity for the lipoylated form. Contrary to some previous suggestions, these results indicate that antibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis patients' sera bind most effectively to a unique peptide-cofactor conformation in the lipoyl domain of the human E2p polypeptide. Moreover, the availability of large amounts of human lipoyl domain will permit further studies into the role of the antigen (if any) in disease pathogenesis.",0
94,19574839,Molecular alterations associated with aneurysmal remodeling are localized in the high hemodynamic stress region of a created carotid bifurcation,"Although elevated hemodynamics has been speculated to play a key role in intracranial aneurysm (IA) initiation, little is known about the specific hemodynamic microenvironment that triggers aneurysmal vascular degradation. We previously demonstrated maladaptive remodeling characteristic of IA initiation occurring in hemodynamic regions of combined high wall shear stress (WSS) and high WSS gradient near the apex of an experimentally created carotid bifurcation. This study examines whether this remodeling recapitulates the molecular changes found in IAs and whether molecular changes also correspond to specific hemodynamic environments. De novo bifurcations were surgically created using both native common carotid arteries in each of 6 dogs. Bifurcations were imaged 2 weeks or 2 months after surgery by high-resolution 3-dimensional angiography, from which flow fields were obtained by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Subsequently, harvested tissues, demonstrating early aneurysmal changes near the apex, were immunostained for interleukin-1beta, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases, nitrotyrosine, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. Spatial distributions of these molecules were comapped with computational fluid dynamics results. The aneurysmal wall showed decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression compared with surrounding segments, the feeding artery, and native controls, whereas all other markers increased. Anti-CD68 staining indicated the absence of inflammatory cells in the aneurysmal wall. Comapping molecular marker distributions with flow fields revealed confinement of these molecular changes within the hemodynamic region of high WSS and high, positive WSS gradient. Aneurysm-initiating remodeling induced by combined high WSS and high, positive WSS gradient is associated with molecular changes implicated in IAs. ",0

96,10378945,Electromyogram-controlled functional electrical stimulation for treatment of the paralyzed upper extremity,"Spinal cord lesions at level C5 to C6 lead to loss of hand functions and lesions at C4 to additional deficits of arm functionality. The presented dual channel surface stimulator with dual channel electromyogram (EMG) measurement was developed to investigate control strategies for an EMG-controlled implantable stimulation system and serves in addition as a therapy device for patients with partial innervation but weak muscle force. Four different control strategies for stimulation amplitude are available. The amplitude can be preset manually or can follow the preprocessed EMG signals proportionally. The shoulder control program allows proportional control of both stimulation channels with one EMG channel while the second EMG channel serves as the channel selector. Finally, a special feedback training program triggers a stimulation burst when EMG activity is detected. During a 2 year patient study, 18 patients from 2 hospitals and 1 rehabilitation center performed the feedback training. Almost all patients obtained an improvement of functionality. Apart from muscle strengthening, the feedback effect led to an improvement of proprioception and supported relearning of motions. For the documentation of the training status, functional muscle test (British Medical Research Council) and measurements of power, angle, torque, muscle fatigue, and EMG were performed. Obviously, EMG triggered stimulation provides several advantages compared to conventional passive electrical stimulation. ",0
97,1110726,Women in health care,"The occupational, class, and sex structure of the United States Health Labor Force is similar to the competitive sector of the economy (i.e., it is predominantly female, poorly paid and poorly unionized). Upper-middle-class men compose the great majority of medical professionals, whereas lower-middle and working-class women form the greatest proportion of all middle-level, clerical and service workers. This division of labor is due to the role of women both in the family and as a reserve of labor for the economy. There is a virtual absence of the majority of producers--lower-middle-class and working-class women-- in the decision-making bodies of the health institutions. The political strategy for change is to introduce institutional democracy in the health sector, with control on the institutions by those who work in them--and those who are served by them.",0
98,11172152,A molecular marker for chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria,"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major health problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Chloroquine resistance has been associated in vitro with point mutations in two genes, pfcrt and pfmdr 1, which encode the P. falciparum digestive-vacuole transmembrane proteins PfCRT and Pgh1, respectively. METHODS: To assess the value of these mutations as markers for clinical chloroquine resistance, we measured the association between the mutations and the response to chloroquine treatment in patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mali. The frequencies of the mutations in patients before and after treatment were compared for evidence of selection of resistance factors as a result of exposure to chloroquine. RESULTS: The pfcrt mutation resulting in the substitution of threonine (T76) for lysine at position 76 was present in all 60 samples from patients with chloroquine-resistant infections (those that persisted or recurred after treatment), as compared with a base-line prevalence of 41 percent in samples obtained before treatment from 116 randomly selected patients (P<0.001), indicating absolute selection for this mutation. The pfmdr 1 mutation resulting in the substitution of tyrosine for asparagine at position 86 was also selected for, since it was present in 48 of 56 post-treatment samples from patients with chloroquine-resistant infections (86 percent), as compared with a base-line prevalence of 50 percent in 115 samples obtained before treatment (P<0.001). The presence of pfcrt T76 was more strongly associated with the development of chloroquine resistance (odds ratio, 18.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 6.5 to 58.3) than was the presence of pfmdr 1 Y86 (odds ratio, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 6.8) or the presence of both mutations (odds ratio, 9.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 22.1). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an association between the pfcrt T76 mutation in P. falciparum and the development of chloroquine resistance during the treatment of malaria. This mutation can be used as a marker in surveillance for chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria.",0
99,24325418,Quality of reporting clinical trials published in five leading Sri Lankan medical journals,"To assess the quality of reporting of clinical trials published in five leading Sri Lankan medical journals. Six medical journals were hand searched for clinical trials published from 1982 to 2011. Eligible criteria were all randomized and non-randomized clinical trials conducted in humans. A checklist was developed based on CONSORT and TREND recommendations. Each study was independently evaluated by two reviewers. Outcome measures were presence of checklist items in published reports. Fifteen randomized and 24 non-randomized parallel group trials from 724 studies in five journals met the inclusion criteria. Out of 39 trials, 39 (97%) clearly described the objectives, 16 (41%) defined the periods of recruitment, 7 (18%) reported how sample size was determined, 10 (25.6%) reported the methods to enhance the quality of measurements, 20 (51%) reported baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of each group, 4 (10%) showed flow diagrams, 23 (69%) reported statistical methods used to compare groups for primary outcomes, 21 (54%) reported effect size, 4 (10%) reported its precision, and 20 (51%) interpreted the results in the context of current evidence, and 5 (13%) described the generalizability of the findings. Of the 15 randomized trials, only one (7%) reported sequence generation, 5 (33%) allocation concealment, 9 (60%) reported blinding status of participants or investigators, and 2 (13%) reported intention to treat analysis. Reporting of several essential recommendations remained suboptimal. Education and training of trial methods and awareness of the CONSORT and TREND statements and more attention to the quality of reporting may improve matters. ",0
100,17452935,ADDRESS (ADministration of DRotrecogin alfa [activated] in Early stage Severe Sepsis) long-term follow-up: one-year safety and efficacy evaluation,"""OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that drotrecogin alfa (activated) has an acceptable safety profile 1 yr from randomization. DESIGN: One-year follow-up of patients participating in a placebo-controlled clinical study of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in severe sepsis patients at low risk of death (the ADDRESS study). SETTING: The study was conducted at 516 hospitals in 34 countries. PATIENTS: The study included 2,640 patients. INTERVENTIONS: One-year follow-up was performed as an addendum to the placebo-controlled ADDRESS study. Treatment groups were compared using the chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier estimates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survival status at 1 yr was obtained for 90% of patients enrolled in the study (n = 2,376). The difference in mortality rate between drotrecogin alfa (activated) and placebo patients was numerically smaller at 1 yr (34.2% and 34.0%, respectively, p = .94) than at 28 days (18.5% and 17.0%, respectively, p = .34). In the subgroups defined by organ dysfunction class (single or multiple) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (<25 or >or=25), the differences in mortality rate between treatment groups at 1 yr were consistent with those observed at 28 days; no significant differences in mortality rates between treatment groups were observed. No additional serious adverse events were reported during the period between hospital discharge and 1 yr. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of death or evidence of harm at 1 yr was associated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) administration in patients with severe sepsis at lower risk of death.""",1

Thirty-eight consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment were analyzed by CT to identify hepatic steatosis (HS) via calculation of the liver/spleen CT ratio in Couinaud's 8 areas. We defined hepatic fatty infiltration as a liver/spleen ratio of less than 0.9. The extent and distribution of the fatty infiltration was assessed using the liver/spleen ratio of the patients who had the lowest CT ratio below 0.9 in the 8 areas. Thirteen (34.2%) of the 38 patients had hepatic fatty infiltration. The liver/spleen ratios of each area differed significantly in all patients (p<0.0001). The CT ratio of these 13 patients was significantly lower in the right lobe than the left lobe (p<0.0001), although the ratios did not differ significantly among the 4 areas of the right lobe (p=0.52). Needle biopsy for diagnosis of NASH should be performed at the right lobe, which contains significantly more infiltrated fat than the left lobe in the liver.",1

104,22508288,Recruitment mechanisms of primary and malignant B cells to the human liver,"B cells are present within chronically inflamed liver tissue and recent evidence implicates them in the progression of liver disease. In addition, a large proportion of hepatic lymphomas are of B-cell origin. The molecular signals that regulate normal and malignant B-cell recruitment into peripheral tissue from blood are poorly understood, leading us to study human B-cell migration through hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in flow-based adhesion assays. In such assays, human blood-derived B cells were captured from shear flow without a previous rolling phase and underwent firm adhesion mediated by vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Unlike T cells, which displayed vigorous crawling behavior on the endothelium, B cells remained static before a proportion underwent transendothelial migration mediated by a combination of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion protein-1, common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor-1/stabilin-1, and the chemokine receptors, CXCR3 and CXCR4. B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary malignant B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal zone B cell lymphoma also underwent integrin-mediated firm adhesion involving ICAM-1 and/or VCAM-1 and demonstrated ICAM-1-dependent shape-change and crawling behavior. Unlike primary lymphocytes, the malignant cells did not undergo transendothelial migration, which could explain why lymphomas are frequently characterized by the intravascular accumulation of malignant cells in the hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that distinct combinations of signals promote B-cell recruitment to the liver, suggesting the possibility of novel targets to modulate liver inflammation in disease. Certain features of lymphocyte homing are maintained in lymphoma recruitment to the liver, suggesting that therapeutic targets for lymphocyte recruitment may also prevent hepatic lymphoma dissemination.",0
105,20216203,"A long-term, open-label study to confirm the safety of topical diclofenac solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide in the treatment of the osteoarthritic knee","To assess the long-term safety of a topical solution of diclofenac sodium in a vehicle containing dimethyl sulfoxide (TDiclo), subjects with radiologically confirmed, symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee(s) applied the clinical dose of TDiclo (40 drops, four times daily) to each painful knee for up to 52 weeks. Safety assessment included adverse events, skin irritation scores of the treated knee(s), ocular examinations, and routine laboratory tests. There were 793 subjects (mean age, 62.5 years) who applied TDiclo to one or both (72%) knees for an average of 204 days, including 463 subjects for 6 months and 144 for 1 year. The most frequent adverse events were at the application site with no increase in incidence with prolonged exposure: dry skin (25.3%), contact dermatitis without vesicles (13.0%) or with vesicles (9.5%). Skin irritation score was 0 (normal) in 61.0% of subjects, 0.5 (dryness or flaking) in 23.9%, 1 or 2 (erythema without or with induration) in 6.9%, and 3 or 4 (erythema with induration and vesicles/bullae) in 8.2%. Subject dropouts included 114 (14.4%) with an application site skin adverse event. Individual subject laboratory test shift to abnormal occurred for hemoglobin (3.2%), aspartate aminotransferase (6.4%), alanine aminotransferase (7.3%), and creatinine (4.2%), but few shifts (less than 0.3% per variable) were clinically significant. No increased risk of cardiovascular or cataract events was noted. This long-term study of TDiclo revealed a safety profile comparable to that shown in multiple, shorter, well-controlled, double-blind trials with the predominant adverse effect noted being an application site reaction.",1

To be developed into a quantitative evaluation method for soft-tissue arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the concept needs assessment of validity. Computed tomography angiography results of 19 soft-tissue AVMs and 18 control abdominal vessels are utilized. Enhanced vascular lumen regions over 120 HU were extracted by a region growing method and skeletonized into wire frame graph models. The number of vascular loop structures in graphs is calculated as 1 - [Number of nodes] + [Number of edges], and results are compared between AVM/control groups, pre-/postprogression, and pre-/posttreatment. Average vascular lumen capacity of AVMs was 57.5 ml/lesion, and average number of vascular loops was 548 loops/lesion. Loop density of AVMs (weighted average, 9.5 loops/ml) exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.001) greater value than normal abdominal blood vessels (weighted average, 1.3 loops/ml). In all 4 cases without treatment, number of loops and loop density both increased. Particularly, number of loops increased greatly by 2 times or more in 3 cases. In all 7 cases with treatment, number of loops and vascular lumen capacity significantly (P = 0.0156) decreased. Particularly, number of loops showed clearer decrease in cases with entire lesion treatment than partial treatment. Total number of described vascular loop structures and their density or volume well reflected the existence, progression, and remission of soft-tissue AVMs. Topological analysis can be expected to be developed into a quantitative evaluation for AVMs. ",0

110,11943262,Genetic variations in HLA-B region and hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir,"Hypersensitivity to abacavir affects about 4% of patients who receive the drug for HIV-1 infection. We did a retrospective, case-control study to identify multiple markers in the vicinity of HLA-B associated with hypersensitivity reactions. HLA-B57 was present in 39 (46%) of 84 patients versus four (4%) of 113 controls (p<0 small middle dot0001). However, because of low numbers of women and other ethnic groups enrolled, these findings relate largely to white men. The lower sensitivity of HLA-B57 for predicting hypersensitivity to abacavir identified in this study compared with a previous report highlights that predictive values for markers will vary across populations. Clinical monitoring and management of hypersensitivity reactions among patients receiving abacavir must remain unchanged.",1
111,20032323,Genetic variants associated with Lp(a) lipoprotein level and coronary disease,"BACKGROUND: An increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein has been identified as a risk factor for coronary artery disease that is highly heritable. The genetic determinants of the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and their relevance for the risk of coronary disease are incompletely understood. METHODS: We used a novel gene chip containing 48,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 candidate genes to test for associations in 3145 case subjects with coronary disease and 3352 control subjects. Replication was tested in three independent populations involving 4846 additional case subjects with coronary disease and 4594 control subjects. RESULTS: Three chromosomal regions (6q26-27, 9p21, and 1p13) were strongly associated with the risk of coronary disease. The LPA locus on 6q26-27 encoding Lp(a) lipoprotein had the strongest association. We identified a common variant (rs10455872) at the LPA locus with an odds ratio for coronary disease of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49 to 1.95) and another independent variant (rs3798220) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.49). Both variants were strongly associated with an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein, a reduced copy number in LPA (which determines the number of kringle IV-type 2 repeats), and a small Lp(a) lipoprotein size. Replication studies confirmed the effects of both variants on the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and the risk of coronary disease. A meta-analysis showed that with a genotype score involving both LPA SNPs, the odds ratios for coronary disease were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.66) for one variant and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.67) for two or more variants. After adjustment for the Lp(a) lipoprotein level, the association between the LPA genotype score and the risk of coronary disease was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two LPA variants that were strongly associated with both an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein and an increased risk of coronary disease. Our findings provide support for a causal role of Lp(a) lipoprotein in coronary disease.",0
112,25262633,In vitro air removal characteristics of two neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass systems: filtration may lead to fractionation of bubbles,"Introduction of gaseous microemboli (GME) into the arterial line of a pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit may lead to cognitive decline and adverse outcomes of the pediatric patient.Arterial filters are incorporated into CPB circuits as a safeguard for gross air and to reduce GME. Recently, arterial filters were integrated in two neonatal oxygenators to reduce volume and foreign surface area. In this study a clinical CPB scenario was simulated. The oxygenators, the corresponding venous reservoirs and the complete CPB circuits were compared regarding air removal and bubble size distribution after the introduction of an air bolus or GME. During a GME challenge, the Capiox FX05 oxygenator removed a significantly higher volume of GME than the QUADROX-i Neonatal oxygenator (97% vs. 86%). Detailed air removal characteristics showed that more GME in the range of 20-50 µm were leaving the devices than were entering. This phenomenon seems to be more present in the Capiox FX05. The circuits were also challenged with an air bolus. Each individual component tested removed 99.9%, which resulted in an air volume reduction of 99.99% by either complete CBP circuit. Overall, we conclude that both CPB systems were very adequate in removing GME and gross air. The air removal properties of both systems are considered safe and reliable. Detailed GME distribution data show that the Capiox FX05 showed more small GME (<50 µm) due to fractionation of larger GME when compared to the QUADROX-i Neonatal. We may conclude that filtration may lead to fractionation. ",0
113,3463861,The inheritance of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and associated behaviors. Evidence for autosomal dominant transmission,"We examined specific genetic hypotheses about the mode of transmission of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, by performing segregation analyses in 30 nuclear families identified through 27 index cases. Because data from earlier family studies had suggested that chronic tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder may be alternative phenotypic expressions of the diathesis of Tourette's syndrome, we used three diagnostic schemes to specify affected family members (Tourette's syndrome only; Tourette's syndrome or chronic tics; and Tourette's syndrome, chronic tics, or obsessive-compulsive disorder). The estimates of penetrance for the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa (A denotes the abnormal allele) in the analyses of subjects with Tourette's syndrome, chronic tics, or obsessive-compulsive disorder were 1.000, 1.000, and 0.002, respectively, for male subjects and 0.709, 0.709, and 0.000 for female subjects. These results predict that approximately 10 percent of all patients are phenocopies. We conclude that our analyses provide strong support for the hypothesis that obsessive-compulsive disorder is etiologically related to Tourette's syndrome and chronic tics in these families, and that Tourette's syndrome is inherited as a highly penetrant, sex-influenced, autosomal dominant trait.",0

STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, 41-site study in 194 children aged 10 to 17 years (inclusive) with heFH (statin-na?ve or on a stable statin regimen). After a 4-week stabilization period (period I), subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, colesevelam 1.875 g/d, or colesevelam 3.75 g/d for 8 weeks (period II). All then received open-label colesevelam 3.75 g/d for 18 weeks (period III), with follow-up 2 weeks later. The primary endpoint was percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol from baseline to week 8. Secondary endpoints included percent change in other lipoprotein variables, including non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol. Adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: At week 8, a significant difference from baseline in LDL-cholesterol was reported with colesevelam 1.875 g/d (-6.3%; P = .031) and colesevelam 3.75 g/d (-12.5%; P < .001) compared with placebo. Significant treatment effects were also reported for total cholesterol (-7.4%), non-HDL-cholesterol (-10.9%), HDL-cholesterol (+6.1%), apolipoprotein A-I (+6.9%), and apolipoprotein B (-8.3%) and a nonsignificant effect for triglycerides (+5.1%) with colesevelam 3.75 g/d compared with placebo at week 8. These treatment effects were maintained during period III. CONCLUSIONS: Colesevelam significantly lowered LDL-cholesterol levels in children with heFH.""",1
115,21740555,Dose-response relationship between arsenic exposure and the serum enzymes for liver function tests in the individuals exposed to arsenic: a cross sectional study in Bangladesh,"BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure has been shown to cause liver damage. However, serum hepatic enzyme activity as recognized on liver function tests (LFTs) showing a dose-response relationship with arsenic exposure has not yet been clearly documented. The aim of our study was to investigate the dose-response relationship between arsenic exposure and major serum enzyme marker activity associated with LFTs in the population living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh. METHODS: A total of 200 residents living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh were selected as study subjects. Arsenic concentrations in the drinking water, hair and nails were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The study subjects were stratified into quartile groups as follows, based on concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water, as well as in subjects' hair and nails: lowest, low, medium and high. The serum hepatic enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were then assayed. RESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in the subjects' hair and nails were positively correlated with arsenic levels in the drinking water. As regards the exposure-response relationship with arsenic in the drinking water, the respective activities of ALP, AST and ALT were found to be significantly increased in the high-exposure groups compared to the lowest-exposure groups before and after adjustments were made for different covariates. With internal exposure markers (arsenic in hair and nails), the ALP, AST and ALT activity profiles assumed a similar shape of dose-response relationship, with very few differences seen in the higher groups compared to the lowest group, most likely due to the temporalities of exposure metrics. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that arsenic concentrations in the drinking water were strongly correlated with arsenic concentrations in the subjects' hair and nails. Further, this study revealed a novel exposure- and dose- response relationship between arsenic exposure metrics and serum hepatic enzyme activity. Elevated serum hepatic enzyme activities in the higher exposure gradients provided new insights into arsenic-induced liver toxicity that might be helpful for the early prognosis of arsenic-induced liver diseases.",1
116,22077677,Use of anti-tumor necrosis factor-? therapy in hepatitis B virus carriers with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis: a case series in Taiwan,"The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? therapy in patients with psoriasis who are hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers is usually not recommended, and routine antiviral prophylaxis is suggested for those who need the treatment. We report our experience on the safety of anti-TNF-? therapy in patients with psoriasis who are HBV carriers in our clinic using HBV viral load as a guide for HBV treatment. Between 2007 and 2011, seven HBV carriers receiving TNF-? inhibitors for psoriasis in our clinic were collected retrospectively. The HBV viral load and aminotransferase levels were regularly monitored. Two of the seven patients were inactive HBV carriers, and the other five patients had chronic hepatitis B. Only one patient received antiviral agents before the anti-TNF-? treatment. The mean duration of the anti-TNF-? treatment was 26.6 months (range, 14-45 months). These patients were followed up from the start of the anti-TNF-? therapy for a mean duration of 28.9 months (range, 14-45 months). HBV reactivation was observed in three patients, one of whom required antiviral treatment. No HBV reactivation-related hepatitis was observed. In conclusion, prevention of HBV reactivation by monitoring of HBV viral load is cost-effective and may decrease the risk of developing drug resistance from routine anti-HBV prophylaxis treatment. It can be considered as an alternative in psoriasis patients treated by TNF-? inhibitors, especially in areas with a high HBV burden and in hepatitis B e-antigen-negative patients who have a lower risk of viral reactivation.",1
117,1617012,Androgenic activity in 15-day-old male rats: role of the maternal pineal gland,"Female Sprague-Dawley rats, exposed to a long (18L:6D) or a short (6L:18D) photoperiod from 21 days of age, were mated when they reached 55 days of age. On Day 2 of gestation, dams were pinealectomized or sham-operated. Pre- and postnatal photoperiods were identical, and offspring were killed at 15 days of age. Maternal pinealectomy had no effect when rats were kept on 18L:6D. Rats born to sham-operated mothers and kept on 6L:18D had higher testicular testosterone and androstenedione content than offspring raised on the long photoperiod. This stimulatory effect of the short photoperiod was blocked by maternal pinealectomy and was not dependent on the offspring's own pineal since it was observed in both sham-operated and neonatally (on Day 5 after birth) pinealectomized rats. When sham-operated mothers housed on 18L:6D were treated daily during pregnancy and lactation by s.c. melatonin injection, there was an increase in the testicular testosterone content of offspring. It was concluded that when rats are maintained on a 6L:18D cycle the maternal pineal gland enhances the testicular testosterone and androstenedione content in 15-day-old offspring. This effect is probably mediated by maternally derived melatonin. At 15 days of age, the pineal of the offspring had no influence on testicular function. ",0

This study compares the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the novel oral renin inhibitor aliskiren with placebo and an active comparator. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator 8-week trial in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or =95 and <110 mm Hg). After a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 652 patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with once-daily oral doses of aliskiren (150, 300, or 600 mg), irbesartan 150 mg, or placebo. Aliskiren 150, 300, and 600 mg effectively lowered both trough mean sitting DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P<0.001 versus placebo for both variables). The least-squares mean reductions in trough DBP were 9.3+/-0.8, 11.8+/-0.8, and 11.5+/-0.8 mm Hg, respectively, versus 6.3+/-0.8 mm Hg for placebo, and the least-squares mean reductions in trough SBP were 11.4+/-1.3, 15.8+/-1.2, and 15.7+/-1.2 mm Hg, respectively, versus 5.3+/-1.2 mm Hg for placebo. The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren 150 mg was comparable to that of irbesartan 150 mg (8.9+/-0.7 and 12.5+/-1.2 mm Hg, least-squares reduction in mean sitting DBP and SBP, respectively, for irbesartan). Aliskiren 300 and 600 mg lowered mean sitting DBP significantly more than irbesartan 150 mg (P<0.05). Aliskiren showed safety and tolerability comparable to those of placebo and irbesartan; the incidence of adverse events and number of patients discontinuing therapy were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with aliskiren lowers blood pressure effectively, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to that of irbesartan and placebo, in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Aliskiren 150 mg is as effective as irbesartan 150 mg in lowering blood pressure.""",1
120,23635947,Pharmacogenomics of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and drug-induced liver injury,"Rare but severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important issue in drug development and in the proper usage of drugs during the post-approval phase. The ability to predict patient susceptibility to severe ADRs would prevent drug administration to high-risk patients. This would save lives and ensure the quality of life for these patients, but occurrence of idiosyncratic severe ADRs had been very difficult to predict for a long time. However, in this decade, genetic markers have been found for several ADRs, especially for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In this review, we summarize recent progress in identifying genetic markers for SCARS and DILI, and discuss issues that remain unresolved. As for SCARs, associations of HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*58:01 have been revealed for carbamazepine- and allopurinol-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal neclolysis, respectively. HLA-B*57:01 is strongly associated with abacavir-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. Several HLA alleles also demonstrate drug-specific associations with DILI, such as HLA-A*33:03 for ticlopidine, HLA-B*57:01 for flucloxacillin and HLA-DQA1*02:01 for lapatinib. Efforts should be continued to find other genetic markers to achieve high predictability for ADRs, with the goal being development of genetic tests for use in clinical settings.",1

With a complete response (CR) rate of 27% on siltuximab plus VMP (S+VMP) and 22% on VMP, the study did not confirm its hypothesis that the addition of siltuximab would increase the CR rate by at least 10%. Overall response rate was 88% on S+VMP and 80% on VMP, and at least very good partial response rates were 71% and 51% (P = .0382), respectively. Median progression-free survival (17 months) and 1-year overall survival (88%) were identical in the 2 arms. Grade ?3 adverse-event incidence was 92% on S+VMP and 81% on VMP (P = .09), with trends toward more hematologic events and infections on S+VMP. Maintenance therapy with siltuximab was well tolerated. In conclusion, the addition of siltuximab to VMP did not improve the CR rate or long-term outcomes. This study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00911859.",1
122,7477221,A national survey of the arrangements managed-care plans make with physicians,"BACKGROUND: Despite the growth of managed care in the United States, there is little information about the arrangements managed-care plans make with physicians. METHODS: In 1994 we surveyed by telephone 138 managed-care plans that were selected from 20 metropolitan areas nationwide. Of the 108 plans that responded, 29 were group-model or staff-model health maintenance organizations (HMOs), 50 were network or independent-practice-association (IPA) HMOs, and 29 were preferred-provider organizations (PPOs). RESULTS: Respondents from all three types of plan said they emphasized careful selection of physicians, although the group or staff HMOs tended to have more demanding requirements, such as board certification or eligibility. Sixty-one percent of the plans responded that physicians' previous patterns of costs or utilization of resources had little influence on their selection; 26 percent said these factors had a moderate influence; and 13 percent said they had a large influence. Some risk sharing with physicians was typical in the HMOs but rare in the PPOs. Fifty-six percent of the network or IPA HMOs used capitation as the predominant method of paying primary care physicians, as compared with 34 percent of the group or staff HMOs and 7 percent of the PPOs. More than half the HMOs reported adjusting payments according to utilization or cost patterns, patient complaints, and measures of the quality of care. Ninety-two percent of the network or IPA HMOs and 61 percent of the group or staff HMOs required their patients to select a primary care physician, who was responsible for most referrals to specialists. About three quarters of the HMOs and 31 percent of the PPOs reported using studies of the outcomes of medical care as part of their quality-improvement programs. CONCLUSIONS: Managed-care plans, particularly HMOs, have complex systems for selecting, paying, and monitoring their physicians. Hybrid forms are common, and the differences between group or staff HMOs and network or IPA HMOs are less extensive than is commonly assumed.",0
123,24653794,Human immunodeficiency virus and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of liver: A systematic review,"""AIM: To investigate the diagnosis, pathogenesis, natural history, and management of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the medical literature regarding NRH in patients with HIV. Inclusion criteria include reports with biopsy proven NRH. We studied the clinical features of NRH, in particular, related to its presenting manifestation and laboratory values. Combinations of the following keywords were implemented: """"nodular regenerative hyperplasia"""", """"human immunodeficiency virus"""", """"noncirrhotic portal hypertension"""", """"idiopathic portal hypertension"""", """"cryptogenic liver disease"""", """"highly active antiretroviral therapy"""" and """"didanosine"""". The bibliographies of these studies were subsequently searched for any additional relevant publications. RESULTS: The clinical presentation of patients with NRH varies from patients being completely asymptomatic to the development of portal hypertension - namely esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites. Liver associated enzymes are generally normal and synthetic function well preserved. There is a strong association between the occurrence of NRH and the use of antiviral therapies such as didanosine. The management of NRH revolves around treating the manifestations of portal hypertension. The prognosis of NRH is generally good since liver function is preserved. A high index of suspicion is required to make a identify NRH. CONCLUSION: The appropriate management of HIV-infected persons with suspected NRH is yet to be outlined. However, NRH is a clinically subtle condition that is difficult to diagnose, and it is important to be able to manage it according to the best available evidence.""",1
124,1534070,Reactive astrocytes in myelin-deficient rat optic nerve reveal an altered distribution of orthogonal arrays of particles (OAP),"Reactive astrocytes are a common feature of various pathological conditions within the CNS. Morphological changes of reactive astrocytes include an altered nucleus-cytoplasm relationship, nuclear indentations, an increased amount of intermediate filaments, and an immunologically immature phenotype. Additionally, the number of orthogonal arrays of particles (OAP) was found to be increased within parenchymal membranes of reactive astrocytes. This observation prompted us to investigate the distribution of astroglial OAP in the amyelinated CNS of the myelin-deficient (md) rat in which reactive astrocytes prevail. In the present freeze-fracture study, astroglial OAP were determined within endfoot and nonendfoot (parenchymal) membranes in the developing optic nerve of md rats and normal littermates at the age of 12, 23, 40, and 64 days postnatally (dpn). The endfoot OAP density in md astrocytes remained constant during the entire period of investigation. In myelinated littermates, OAP densities continuously increased up to adult values. In contrast, the parenchymal OAP density in md astrocytes increased during the entire period of investigation. In normal littermates, OAP densities remained constant during the first 40 dpn and thereafter increased rapidly. These observations suggest that the absence of myelinogenesis in the md mutant may be a stimulus for parenchymal membranes of reactive astrocytes to insert OAP or to assemble OAP subunits into complete arrays.

125,16513809,Association between reported exposure to road traffic and respiratory symptoms in children: evidence of bias,"Many studies showing effects of traffic-related air pollution on health rely on self-reported exposure, which may be inaccurate. We estimated the association between self-reported exposure to road traffic and respiratory symptoms in preschool children, and investigated whether the effect could have been caused by reporting bias. In a random sample of 8700 preschool children in Leicestershire, UK, exposure to road traffic and respiratory symptoms were assessed by a postal questionnaire (response rate 80%). The association between traffic exposure and respiratory outcomes was assessed using unconditional logistic regression and conditional regression models (matching by postcode). Prevalence odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for self-reported road traffic exposure, comparing the categories 'moderate' and 'dense', respectively, with 'little or no' were for current wheezing: 1.26 (1.13-1.42) and 1.30 (1.09-1.55); chronic rhinitis: 1.18 (1.05-1.31) and 1.31 (1.11-1.56); night cough: 1.17 (1.04-1.32) and 1.36 (1.14-1.62); and bronchodilator use: 1.20 (1.04-1.38) and 1.18 (0.95-1.46). Matched analysis only comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic children living at the same postcode (thus exposed to similar road traffic) showed similar ORs, suggesting that parents of children with respiratory symptoms reported more road traffic than parents of asymptomatic children. Our study suggests that reporting bias could explain some or even all the association between reported exposure to road traffic and disease. Over-reporting of exposure by only 10% of parents of symptomatic children would be sufficient to produce the effect sizes shown in this study. Future research should be based only on objective measurements of traffic exposure. ",0

METHODS: All patients with RA who had started MTX after January 1, 1993, were selected from a regional hospital based registration system. Data on demographic and clinical features were retrieved through chart review. By means of life table analysis and Cox regression analysis, MTX survival and the relation between demographic variables, clinical features, and MTX survival were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1072 MTX treatment episodes in 1022 patients were analyzed. The cumulative MTX survival probability after 5 years was 64%, and after 9 years was 50%. Univariate analysis showed a significant relation between MTX survival probability and folic acid supplementation, attending rheumatologist, concurrent prednisolone use, concurrent sulfasalazine use, and the number of previous disease modifying drugs. In the multivariate analysis folic acid supplementation, attending rheumatologist, and concurrent prednisolone use remained significantly related to MTX survival. Age, disease duration, and creatinine clearance were not. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of 1022 patients with RA the cumulative MTX survival probability was 64% after 5 years and 50% after 9 years. Folic acid supplementation and to a lesser extent prednisolone were associated with a longer MTX survival. In addition, treatment strategies of individual rheumatologists influenced MTX survival.",1

The major advantage of cephaloridine is its relatively greater resistance to metabolic degradation, presumably by the liver. This results in more prolonged blood levels in healthy subjects and a longer half-life in patients with severe renal disease. These features, together with reported enhanced antimicrobial activity and lack of inhibition by serum, suggest that it may replace or substitute for the parent compound, cephalothin, provided further clinical trials indicate that it proves to be an effective agent. Suggestions are given for a modified dosage schedule in uremic patients and during hemodialysis.",0

A case is reported of cholestatic hepatitis occurring during such treatment, in which there was a previous history of an isolated hepatic affection. The administration of INH and rifampicin caused cholestasis alone, which reoccurred after rifampicin administration only. No immuno-allergic phenomenon has been shown to be involved in rifampicin toxicity. This observation suggests that rifampicin may be hepatotoxic itself, especially in patients with previous hepatic affections.",1
132,7896655,"Naltrexone in young autistic children: a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study","""OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of naltrexone, an opiate blocker, in the treatment of autism. METHOD: Thirteen children with autistic disorder, aged 3.4 to 8.3 years (mean 5.4), were studied in home, school, and outpatient laboratory. Naltrexone, 1.0 mg/kg, was given daily in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Dependent measures included parent and teacher Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Conners Rating Scales, and Naltrexone Side-Effects (SE) Rating Scale; laboratory CGI, movement actometer readings, and a 10-second interval recording system analysis of on-task, communication initiations, disruptive behavior, and self-stimulation. RESULTS: Eight of 13 subjects improved in two or more settings. Changes in parent measures (CGI, Conners Impulsivity-Hyperactivity Factor, and SE-Restlessness) and Teacher CGI achieved statistical significance. Teacher SE-Restlessness and initiation of communication in the clinic showed a trend toward improvement. Actometer readings improved in two children who were very active at baseline. Adverse side effects were behavioral, mild, and transient. Administering the bitter tablet was a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone offers promise as an agent for modest improvement of behavior and social communication in young children with autism. Parent and teacher measures can be useful in outpatient trials to evaluate change.""",1
133,876909,Acute renal failure following copper sulphate intoxication,"Eleven out of a series of twenty-nine patients (37-9%) with acute copper sulphate poisoning developed acute renal failure. Intravascular haemolysis appeared to be the chief factor responsible for renal lesions in these patients. Histological lesions observed in the kidney varied from those of mild shock to well established acute tubular necrosis. In one case, granulomatous lesions were seen in response to tubulorrhexis. Renal failure was the chief indication for dialysis in ten patients, whereas one patient was dialysed primarily for removal of copper. Notwithstanding the adequate control of uraemia by dialysis, only six of the eleven patients recovered. Septicaemia was responsible for death in three, hepatic failure in one and methaemoglobinaemia in another. It is postulated that release of copper from haemolysed red cells during acute haemolytic episodes may initiate, or contribute to, the development of renal damage.",1
134,4033706,The effect of dietary protein on the clearance of allopurinol and oxypurinol,"A decrease in dietary protein is known to depress renal plasma flow and creatinine clearance. Using a randomized crossover design, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of allopurinol and its principal metabolite, oxypurinol, after oral administration of 600 mg of allopurinol in six normal subjects receiving a high-protein (268 g per day) or low-protein (19 g per day) diet. For allopurinol, the area under the curve of plasma concentration versus time increased by a factor of 1.45 (P less than 0.02), the renal clearance decreased by 28 per cent (P less than 0.02), and the ratio of the clearance of allopurinol to that of creatinine (fractional excretion) was unchanged between the low-protein and high-protein diets. For oxypurinol, the area under the curve increased nearly three-fold (P less than 0.02), the renal clearance decreased by 64 per cent (P less than 0.02), the fractional excretion decreased by 49 per cent (P less than 0.02), and the plasma oxypurinol half-life increased nearly threefold from 17.3 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 49.9 +/- 2.9 hours (P less than 0.02) during the low-protein diet, as compared with the high-protein diet. We conclude that with the low-protein diet, the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of allopurinol were minimally altered but the total-body clearance of oxypurinol was greatly reduced because of a large increase in the net renal tubular reabsorption of oxypurinol.",0
135,9882396,Design and synthesis of fluorogenic trypsin peptide substrates based on resonance energy transfer,"An assay based on new internally quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates with the general structure 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL)-Gly-Pro-Ala-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Ile-Gly-5-(2-aminoethylamino++ +)naphtha lene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS), where Xaa = Arg, Lys, has been developed to measure proteolytic activity of trypsin and similar proteases. The kinetic parameters for the tryptic hydrolysis of DABCYL-Gly-Pro-Ala-Arg-Leu-Ala-Ile-Gly-EDANS are Km = 34 microM, kcat = 40 s-1, and kcat/Km = 1.17 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. The substrates offer two advantages over common substrates. First they are very sensitive. Applications to chemically modified trypsin and engineered variants show the ability to detect traces of proteolytic activity. In addition, these substrates are adapted to the S'-specificity of the investigated protease. These features and the prospect of miniaturization makes the assay suitable for applications to high-throughput screening. ",0
136,19299721,"B cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and autoantibody production in ectopic lymphoid tissue in murine lupus","""Intraperitoneal exposure of nonautoimmune mice to 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD) causes lupus and the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissue. Although associated with humoral autoimmunity, it is not known whether Ab responses develop within ectopic lymphoid tissue or if B cells only secondarily migrate there. We show that ectopic lymphoid tissue induced by TMPD not only resembles secondary lymphoid tissue morphologically, but it also displays characteristics of germinal center reactions. Proliferating T and B lymphocytes were found within ectopic lymphoid tissue, activation-induced cytidine deaminase was expressed, and class-switched B cells were present. The presence of circular DNA intermediates, a hallmark of active class switch recombination, suggested that class switching occurs within the ectopic lymphoid tissue. Individual collections of ectopic lymphoid tissue (""""lipogranulomas"""") from the same mouse contained different B cell repertoires, consistent with local germinal center-like reactions. Class-switched anti-RNP autoantibody-producing cells were also found in the lipogranulomas. Somatic hypermutation in the lipogranulomas was T cell-dependent, as was the production of isotype-switched anti-Sm/RNP autoantibodies. Thus, ectopic lymphoid tissue induced by TMPD recapitulates many of the functional characteristics of secondary lymphoid tissue and contains autoantibody-secreting cells, which may escape from normal censoring mechanisms in this location.

137,23664723,Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 gene and gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity,"INTRODUCTION: Gefitinib induces severe hepatotoxicity in approximately a quarter of Japanese patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes--including CYP3A4/5, CYP1A1, and CYP2D6--in the liver. We hypothesized that polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene may account for gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene were analyzed in 55 patients with NSCLC who experienced grade >/= 2 transaminase elevation from gefitinib. The distribution of the CYP2D6 genotype was compared with that of the healthy Japanese population. The correlations between the nonfunctional allele *5 or the reduced-function allele *10 and hepatotoxicity-related clinical factors were also examined. RESULTS: The distribution of the CYP2D6 genotype in the study participants was not different from that of the general Japanese population, reported previously. Existence of allele *5 or *10 did not correlate with clinical factors such as onset of hepatotoxicity within 2 months, grade >/= 3 serum transaminase elevation, and tolerability to dose reduction or rechallenge of gefitinib. However, in 7 patients taking CYP3A4-inhibitory drugs, rechallenge of gefitinib again caused hepatotoxicity in 4 patients with allele *5 or *10 but not in 3 patients with normal alleles (P = .029). Moreover, switching to erlotinib did not cause hepatotoxicity in any of 17 patients with allele *5 or *10 but did in 3 of 8 patients without these alleles (P = .024). CONCLUSION: Reduced function of CYP2D6 may partly account for gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity when CYP3A4 is inhibited. Erlotinib could be safely used in patients with decreased CYP2D6 activity even after they experienced gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity.",1
138,10706572,The past incidence of hepatitis C virus infection: implications for the future burden of chronic liver disease in the United States,"Because chronic liver disease may develop many years after acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the past incidence of acute infections is a major determinant of the future burden of HCV-associated complications. We estimated past incidence of acute HCV infection using national seroprevalence data and relative age-specific incidence data from a sentinel counties surveillance system. Projections of the future prevalence of HCV-infected patients were derived from models that included an 85% drop in HCV infection incidence as observed for reported cases in the early 1990s. The models showed a large increase in the incidence of HCV infections from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. The degree of increase was dependent on the assumed rate of antibody loss; a model with 2.5% annual antibody loss showed annual incidence increasing from 45,000 infections (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0-110,000) in the early 1960s to 380,000 infections (95% CI: 250,000 to 500, 000) in the 1980s. Projections showed that although the prevalence of HCV infection may be declining currently because of the decline in incidence in the 1990s, the number of persons infected for >/=20 years could increase substantially before peaking in 2015. If the incidence of new HCV infections does not increase in the future, persons born between 1940 and 1965 will be at highest lifetime risk of acquiring the infection.",0

The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain. Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies. All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG/VP/CPM. Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored.",1

They serve as dietary precursors for the formation of prostanoids and other eicosanoids thus are of great significance in health and modulation of disease conditions. Eicosanoids are powerful autocrine and paracrine regulators of cell and tissue functions: thrombocyte aggregation, inflammatory reactions and leukocyte functions, vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, blood pressure, bronchial constriction, and uterine contraction. Recent attention has focused on the effect of n-3 and n-6 long chain EFAs in normal fetal development. Results from human infant studies suggest that n-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal development of visual and brain function. Human milk is the best and only time proven source of fat and dietary essential fatty acids for infant feeding. International recommendations for n-3 and n-6 EFA dietary intake are reviewed and suggested intakes for long chain EFAs are provided. ",0

An abdominal ultrasound scan showed lesions in the right lobe of liver which were thought to be metastases. However, a biopsy showed primary HCC. Studies in rats suggest that tamoxifen is involved in hepatic carcinogenesis but studies in humans have failed to show any increased risk. However, these studies followed up patients for less than five years. An increased risk of HCC may not become apparent until after a decade or more of tamoxifen therapy. In addition, HCC in tamoxifen treated patients may be under-reported since there may be reluctance to biopsy liver tumours which are assumed to be secondary carcinoma of the breast.",1

These subjects have a newly discovered homozygous mutation of a 5' splice site in LHB: IVS2+1G-->C.

145,2819322,The mode of action of caffeine on catecholamine release from perfused adrenal glands of cat,"1 Adrenaline and noradrenaline secretion induced by caffeine was investigated in the perfused cat adrenal glands. 2 Caffeine (10-80 mM) caused a dose-dependent increase in both adrenaline and noradrenaline secretion when applied for 1 min and 10 min after replacing Ca2+ with 10(-5)M EGTA in the perfusion solution. The ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline was about 1:1. Mg2+ and/or Ca2+ inhibited the response to caffeine. 3 When caffeine (40 mM) was repeatedly applied in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the secretory response almost disappeared but only at the second challenge with caffeine. However, the response was partially restored after readmission of Ca2+ (2.2 mM) and was augmented after the readmission of Ca2+ with ouabain (10(-5) M). 4 Caffeine-induced secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline increased with the increase in the preloaded concentration of Ca2+ and attained a maximum at 16 mM Ca2+. 5 During perfusion with Ca2+-free Locke solution containing hexamethonium (10(-3)M), acetylcholine (10(-4)M) caused increases in both adrenaline and noradrenaline secretions with a ratio of about 1:2. The secretory responses were partially inhibited by preceding stimulation with exposure to caffeine (80 mM). 6 These results suggest that caffeine mobilizes Ca2+ from an intracellular storage site that may not be entirely the same as that linked to muscarinic receptors, and causes an increase in both adrenaline and noradrenaline secretion from cat adrenal chromaffin cells.

147,22031499,Human liver cell spheroids in extended perfusion bioreactor culture for repeated-dose drug testing,"Primary cultures of human hepatocyte spheroids are a promising in vitro model for long-term studies of hepatic metabolism and cytotoxicity. The lack of robust methodologies to culture cell spheroids, as well as a poor characterization of human hepatocyte spheroid architecture and liver-specific functionality, have hampered a widespread adoption of this three-dimensional culture format. In this work, an automated perfusion bioreactor was used to obtain and maintain human hepatocyte spheroids. These spheroids were cultured for 3-4 weeks in serum-free conditions, sustaining their phase I enzyme expression and permitting repeated induction during long culture times; rate of albumin and urea synthesis, as well as phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzyme gene expression and activity of spheroid hepatocyte cultures, presented reproducible profiles, despite basal interdonor variability (n = 3 donors). Immunofluorescence microscopy of human hepatocyte spheroids after 3-4 weeks of long-term culture confirmed the presence of the liver-specific markers, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4?, albumin, cytokeratin 18, and cytochrome P450 3A. Moreover, immunostaining of the atypical protein kinase C apical marker, as well as the excretion of a fluorescent dye, evidenced that these spheroids spontaneously assemble a functional bile canaliculi network, extending from the surface to the interior of the spheroids, after 3-4 weeks of culture. CONCLUSION: Perfusion bioreactor cultures of primary human hepatocyte spheroids maintain a liver-specific activity and architecture and are thus suitable for drug testing in a long-term, repeated-dose format.",0

Lactic acidosis alone or associated with hepatic abnormalities has also been reported. A single report mentioned the concomitant occurrence of muscular and hepatic disturbances and lactic acidosis in a patient receiving zidovudine, but muscle and liver tissues were not studied. A 57-year-old man with AIDS, who had been treated with zidovudine for 3 years, developed fatigue and weight loss. Serum creatine kinase and hepatic enzyme levels were high.

After withdrawal of zidovudine, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels normalised within 5 days, and lactacidaemia decreased. Acidosis persisted. The patient became confused and febrile and died 8 days after detection of high blood lactic acid. A muscle sample obtained at autopsy showed mitochondrial abnormalities with ragged-red fibres and lipid droplet accumulation. Southern blot analysis showed depletion of mitochondrial DNA, affecting skeletal muscle and liver tissue. No depletion was found in myocardium and kidney. This case emphasises that zidovudine treatment can induce mitochondrial multisystem disease, as revealed in our case by myopathy, liver steatosis and lactic acidosis.",1

153,24987169,Assessment methods for angiogenesis and current approaches for its quantification,"Angiogenesis is a physiological process which describes the development of new blood vessels from the existing vessels. It is a common and the most important process in the formation and development of blood vessels, so it is supportive in the healing of wounds and granulation of tissues. The different assays for the evaluation of angiogenesis have been described with distinct advantages and some limitations. In order to develop angiogenic and antiangiogenic techniques, continuous efforts have been resulted to give animal models for more quantitative analysis of angiogenesis. Most of the studies on angiogenic inducers and inhibitors rely on various models, both in vitro, in vivo and in ova, as indicators of efficacy. The angiogenesis assays are very much helpful to test efficacy of both pro- and anti- angiogenic agents. The development of non-invasive procedures for quantification of angiogenesis will facilitate this process significantly. The main objective of this review article is to focus on the novel and existing methods of angiogenesis and their quantification techniques. These findings will be helpful to establish the most convenient methods for the detection, quantification of angiogenesis and to develop a novel, well tolerated and cost effective anti-angiogenic treatment in the near future.

154,17983767,Difference in carotid intima-media thickness between Korean and Japanese men,"Koreans are recently at higher risk for coronary heart disease than are the Japanese. We aimed to evaluate levels of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary risk factors in Korean and Japanese men in the post-World War II birth cohort. We conducted a population-based study of 352 randomly selected healthy men 40 to 49 years of age: 102 Koreans in Ansan City, Gyeonggi-do, Korea and 250 Japanese in Kusatsu City, Shiga, Japan. Imaging carotid IMT by ultrasonography and other procedures were standardized. Analyzing blood samples and reading carotid IMT were performed at the University of Pittsburgh. Despite more favorable or similar features in coronary risk factors as compared to Japanese men, the Korean men had a higher crude IMT level than the Japanese men (mean +/- standard error, 0.655+/-0.008 mm vs 0.616+/-0.005 mm, respectively, p<0.0001). The difference in the levels of carotid IMT significantly remained after adjusting for metabolic and conventional risk factors (0.654+/-0.008 mm vs. 0.616+/-0.005 mm, respectively; p<0.0001). Among men 40 to 49 years of age, Koreans had significantly higher levels of carotid IMT than the Japanese. Factors that underlie the different susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis need to be explored. ",0

156,10378401,Iodine deficiency in Turkey,"Turkey is an iodine deficiency area. The overall goitre prevalence is thought to be 30%, and most epidemiological studies give figures compatible with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. However, it is suspected that there are regions where iodine deficiency might be more severe than previously known. In this study the goitre prevalence and iodine status in a mountain village in Central Anatolia were investigated and the results compared to those of an urban area with mild iodine deficiency. Parameters of iodine status in the mountainous region showed severe iodine deficiency comparable to that in Central Africa. It seems that there are regions in Turkey where current programmes of salt iodization will be inadequate to correct the problem of iodine deficiency. Our observations suggest that regional variations in iodine status may impede the success of salt iodization programmes, which alone may not be adequate for correction of the problem country-wide. Alternative sources of iodine should be considered in addition to expanded and more efficient salt iodization programmes. ",0

The primary objective was to determine superiority of dulaglutide 1.5 mg versus placebo in HbA1c change at 26 weeks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 52-week, multicenter, parallel-arm study (primary end point: 26 weeks) randomized patients (2:2:2:1) to dulaglutide 1.5 mg, dulaglutide 0.75 mg, exenatide 10 ?g, or placebo (placebo-controlled period: 26 weeks). Patients were treated with metformin (1,500-3,000 mg) and pioglitazone (30-45 mg). Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). RESULTS: Least squares mean ? SE HbA1c change from baseline to the primary end point was -1.51 ? 0.06% (-16.5 ? 0.7 mmol/mol) for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, -1.30 ? 0.06% (-14.2 ? 0.7 mmol/mol) for dulaglutide 0.75 mg, -0.99 ? 0.06% (-10.8 ? 0.7 mmol/mol) for exenatide, and -0.46 ? 0.08% (-5.0 ? 0.9 mmol/mol) for placebo. Both dulaglutide doses were superior to placebo at 26 weeks (both adjusted one-sided P < 0.001) and exenatide at 26 and 52 weeks (both adjusted one-sided P < 0.001). Greater percentages of patients reached HbA1c targets with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg than with placebo and exenatide (all P < 0.001). At 26 and 52 weeks, total hypoglycemia incidence was lower in patients receiving dulaglutide 1.5 mg than in those receiving exenatide; no dulaglutide-treated patients reported severe hypoglycemia. The most common gastrointestinal adverse events for dulaglutide were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Events were mostly mild to moderate and transient. CONCLUSIONS: Both once-weekly dulaglutide doses demonstrated superior glycemic control versus placebo and exenatide with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile.""",1
158,7286784,Oxidative metabolism of halothane in the production of altered hepatocyte membrane antigens in acute halothane-induced hepatic necrosis,"Previous investigations have shown that patients with fulminant hepatic failure after halothane anaesthesia have a circulating antibody which reacts with an antigen present on the surface of halothane-altered hepatocytes. In the present study, it has been shown that the expression of the antigen is associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane, in contrast with results of other groups which have shown that the reductive route is involved in the direct hepatotoxic reaction attributed to halothane.",1
159,21306565,Hla-B alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions in the Han Chinese population,"Lamotrigine (LTG) is a commonly used antiepileptic drug. However, the use of LTG is limited because of its cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) ranging from mild maculopapular eruption (MPE) to severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has been identified in Chinese and Thai. Although three of seven cases with HLA-B*1502 have been reported in LTG-induced SJS/TEN so far, the relationship between HLA-B*1502 and LTG-induced SJS/TEN needs further investigation. It is also unclear whether there is a specific genetic marker associated with LTG-induced MPE in Chinese. In this study, we genotyped 43 Han Chinese patients treated with LTG (14 cases with LTG-induced cADRs and 29 LTG-tolerant controls), using PCR-SSP for HLA-B*1502 testing and low-resolution genotyping, as well as sequencing for four-digit genotyping. The two cases with SJS were negative for HLA-B*1502, with B1301/1301 and 4601/5610, respectively. Combining the data with previous studies, there was no significant difference in the frequency of subjects with HLA-B*1502 between the LTG-induced SJS/TEN group and the LTG-tolerant group (p = 0.08, OR 4.23, 95% CI 0.94-18.97). In the MPE group, only one was positive for HLA-B*1502. There was no significant difference in the frequency of a specific HLA-B allele between the MPE group and the LTG-tolerant group either. In this study, no significant association between HLA-B*1502 and LTG-induced SJS or MPE was found. Given the small sample size and only HLA-B locus genotyping, further large-scale studies are required to explore genetic associations with LTG-induced cADRs.",1
160,28944837,Role of PIM2 in allergic asthma,"T cell‑associated inflammation, particularly type 2 inflammation, has an important role in asthma pathogenesis, which is suppressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 2 (PIM2), a member off the serine/threonine kinase family, promotes the growth and survival of T cells and influences the function of Treg cells. However, whether PIM2 affects asthma pathogenesis remains unclear. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Treg cells from asthmatic and healthy subjects were obtained, and the expression level of PIM2 was measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. In addition, BALB/c female mice sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin were used as an asthma model, and PIM2 inhibitor was injected during the challenge period to observe the effect of PIM2 on asthma. The asthma symptoms were recorded, and airway hyper‑responsiveness (AHR), expression levels of cytokines in the serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the number of BALF leukocytes were evaluated. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry of lung tissues was performed. The results demonstrated that PIM2 was overexpressed in patients with asthma in natural Treg cells. Inhibition of PIM2 attenuated asthma symptoms, and improved AHR and airway inflammation compared with asthmatic mice without inhibition of PIM2. In addition, expression levels of interleukin (IL)‑10 and forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) in BALF were increased following PIM2 inhibition (IL‑10, 470.3±21.78 vs. 533.7±25.55 pg/ml, P<0.05; FOXP3, 259±4.68 vs. 279.3±3.68 pg/ml; asthma and PIM2 inhibition groups, respectively; P<0.05). In conclusion, PIM2 may exhibit an important role in asthma pathogenesis and exacerbate AHR, airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. These effects of PIM2 may be dependent on Treg cells and the secretion of IL‑10 by Tregs. The results of the present study suggest that PIM2 may be a potential target molecule for asthma treatment.

161,17983266,Macrophage activation redirects yersinia-infected host cell death from apoptosis to caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis,"Infection of macrophages by Yersinia species results in YopJ-dependent apoptosis, and naïve macrophages are highly susceptible to this form of cell death. Previous studies have demonstrated that macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prior to infection are resistant to YopJ-dependent cell death; we found this simultaneously renders macrophages susceptible to killing by YopJ(-) Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb). YopJ(-) Yptb-induced macrophage death was dependent on caspase-1 activation, resulting in rapid permeability to small molecules, followed by membrane breakdown and DNA damage, and accompanied by cleavage and release of proinflammatory interleukin-18. Induction of caspase-1-dependent death, or pyroptosis, required the bacterial type III translocon but none of its known translocated proteins. Wild-type Yptb infection also triggered pyroptosis: YopJ-dependent activation of proapoptotic caspase-3 was significantly delayed in activated macrophages and resulted in caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. The transition to susceptibility was not limited to LPS activation; it was also seen in macrophages activated with other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and intact nonviable bacteria. Yptb infection triggered macrophage activation and activation of caspase-1 in vivo. Y. pestis infection of activated macrophages also stimulated caspase-1 activation. These results indicate that host signaling triggered by TLR and other activating ligands during the course of Yersinia infection redirects both the mechanism of host cell death and the downstream consequences of death by shifting from noninflammatory apoptosis to inflammatory pyroptosis.

162,23834609,"The association of screen time, television in the bedroom, and obesity among school-aged youth: 2007 National Survey of Children's Health","Among school-aged youth, we sought to identify characteristics associated with (1) exceeding screen time recommendations (ie, television/videos/video games more than 2 hours/weekday), and (2) exceeding screen time recommendations, the presence of a television in the bedroom, and obesity. Using 2007 National Survey of Children's Health data, we used multivariable logistic regression to identify sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with excessive screen time among 6 to 11- and 12 to 17-year-olds on a typical weekday. For 12 to 17-year-olds only, we used logistic regression to examine the odds of obesity using the same variables as above, with the addition of screen time. Overall, 20.8% of 6 to 11-year-olds and 26.1% of 12 to 17-year-olds had excessive screen time. For both age groups, having a bedroom TV was significantly associated with excessive screen time. For the older age group, the dual scenario of excessive screen time with a bedroom TV had the strongest association with obesity (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.9, 3.2). Given the similar risk factors for excess screen time and having a TV in the bedroom, a public health challenge exists to design interventions to reduce screen time among school-aged youth. ",0
163,790183,Maternal-fetal relation. Absence of an immunologic blocking factor from the serum of women with chronic abortions,"""We investigated an immunologic mechanism that might explain the apparent """"tolerant"""" state of the mother during pregnancy. Cellular-immune reactivity in vitro to paternal alloantigens was demonstrated in multigravid women by production of lymphocyte migration inhibitory factor. Serum from normal multigravid women contained a factor that blocked production of migration inhibitory factor by maternal lymphocytes to paternal antigens in a specific manner. The blocking factor was an IgG antibody whose activity was removed by absorption with paternal lymphocytes but not with pooled human platelets. We tested the biologic importance of this blocking factor in women who have difficulty maintaining a normal term pregnancy. Our observations indicate that women who experience idiopathic spontaneous abortions produce lymphocyte migration inhibitory factor to paternal alloantigens, but their serums lack the blocking factor. The presence of the serum blocking factor during pregnancy may contribute to the success of the fetus as an allograft.""",0

165,11547740,Infection with GB virus C and reduced mortality among HIV-infected patients,"BACKGROUND: The flavivirus GB virus C (GBV-C, also designated hepatitis G virus) was identified in a search for hepatitis viruses, but no disease is currently known to be associated with it. We investigated the relation between coinfection with GBV-C and the long-term outcome in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: A total of 197 HIV-positive patients were followed prospectively beginning in 1993 or 1994. Of these patients, 33 (16.8 percent) tested positive for GBV-C RNA, 112 (56.9 percent) had detectable antibodies against the GBV-C envelope protein E2, and 52 (26.4 percent) had no marker of GBV-C infection and were considered unexposed. We assessed the relation between GBV-C infection and the progression of HIV disease. We also tested 169 GBV-C-positive plasma samples with a quantitative branched-chain DNA (bDNA) assay in order to investigate possible correlations between GBV-C viral load and both the CD4+ cell count and the HIV load. RESULTS: Among the patients who tested positive for GBV-C RNA, survival was significantly longer, and there was a slower progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Survival after the development of AIDS was also better among the GBV-C-positive patients. The association of GBV-C viremia with reduced mortality remained significant in analyses stratified according to age and CD4+ cell count. In an analysis restricted to the years after highly active antiretroviral therapy became available, the presence of GBV-C RNA remained predictive of longer survival (P=0.02). The HIV load was lower in the GBV-C-positive patients than in the GBV-C-negative patients. The GBV-C load correlated inversely with the HIV load (r=-0.33, P<0.001) but did not correlate with the CD4+ cell count. CONCLUSIONS: Coinfection with GBV-C is associated with a reduced mortality rate in HIV-infected patients. GBV-C is not known to cause any disease, but it is possible that its presence leads to an inhibition of HIV replication. However, GBV-C infection could also be a marker for the presence of other factors that lead to a favorable HIV response.",0
166,18607115,Vancomycin-induced DRESS syndrome in a female patient,"BACKGROUND: DRESS syndrome (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) is a hypersensitivity reaction with skin rashes, eosinophilia, fever, lymph node enlargement and internal organ involvement. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old diabetic woman was hospitalized at the University Hospitals of Geneva for mid-leg amputation due to peripheral arterial occlusive disease. No drug allergy was reported. Because of a wound infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, treatment with vancomycin (2 g/day) in continuous perfusion was initiated. Approximately 2 weeks later, she developed a toxidermia with fever, a progressive maculopapular skin rash, eosinophilia and acute renal insufficiency. The skin biopsy revealed a necrosis with lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrations, supporting the suspicion of DRESS syndrome. A cure was achieved by the withdrawal of vancomycin and the administration of methylprednisolone (1 g/day), antihistaminics and topical mometasone, without the introduction of other antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin can be a cause of DRESS syndrome. A high index of suspicion is warranted in order not to miss this potentially lethal disease.",1
167,15787813,Monitoring patients on methotrexate: hepatic fibrosis not seen in patients with normal serum assays of aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen,"BACKGROUND: The aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) is formed during the synthesis of type III collagen and can be measured in the serum. It has been used as a marker for hepatic fibrosis in patients on long-term methotrexate and it has been suggested that serial assay of PIIINP could reduce or eliminate the need for liver biopsies in these patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether routine use of the PIIINP assay in a cohort of patients on methotrexate would reliably identify those who were developing hepatic fibrosis and exclude those who were not, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for liver biopsies in this latter group. METHODS: Data were available from a clinical series of 38 patients on methotrexate, who had undergone a total of 70 liver biopsies and 306 PIIINP assays. Liver biopsies were graded using the Roenigk classification. RESULTS: In 34 patients, the findings on 46 liver biopsies could be compared with the results of contemporaneous PIIINP assays. Apart from two biopsies from two patients where fibrosis was no longer detected on a subsequent biopsy, all four biopsies showing fibrosis had abnormal results on over half of the associated PIIINP assays. There were no biopsies showing fibrosis where all associated PIIINP assays were normal. However, 50% of biopsies without fibrosis had at least one abnormal associated assay. In 23 patients, the results of serial PIIINP assays performed between two sequential liver biopsies were correlated with changes in the biopsy in terms of fibrosis. Data were available for 32 pairs of liver biopsies. Apart from a biopsy pair in one patient where fibrosis on the second biopsy was not detected on a third biopsy, all four biopsy pairs defined as showing deterioration had abnormal results on over half of the intervening PIIINP assays. There were no biopsy pairs showing deterioration where all intervening assay results were normal. However, 63% of stable biopsy pairs had at least one abnormal intervening assay. Two patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which manifests a pattern of fibrosis not scored under the Roenigk classification, had persistently and substantially elevated PIIINP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented support the view that follow-up liver biopsies, as recommended by published guidelines, for patients on long-term low-dose methotrexate can be avoided if PIIINP levels are consistently normal. This approach would have reduced the number of patients requiring biopsy in our series by 45%. The PIIINP assay will also be helpful in the management of patients on methotrexate in whom liver biopsy is contraindicated, and in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.",1
168,22710999,Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid hepatotoxicity in children,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were to determine the importance of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AC) hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population and to characterise the episodes identified and potential host-specific factors. This was addressed via a prospective observational study in which 8 Spanish hospitals participated. METHODS: A total of 11 cases were examined. For each patient included in the study, a structured and codified data-collection protocol was complied with, taking note of patient demographics, characteristics of the treatment assumed to provoke the reaction, concomitant medication, course and outcome of the episode, and laboratory variables during the reaction. The latter were determined every 6 months from the outset to the eventual resolution of the case. RESULTS: A total of 11 cases of AC hepatotoxicity were detected, affecting 9 boys and 2 girls, ages 1 to 11 years. Causality criteria were assessed using the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the introduction of hepatotoxicity record systems in paediatric care, together with the continuing study and development of existing systems, would contribute to improving our epidemiological knowledge about the harmful effects of drugs on the liver.",1
169,10377406,A functional bone morphogenetic protein system in the ovary,"""Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) comprise a large group of polypeptides in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily with essential physiological functions in morphogenesis and organogenesis in both vertebrates and invertebrates. At present, the role of BMPs in the reproductive system of any species is poorly understood. Here, we have established the existence of a functional BMP system in the ovary, replete with ligand, receptor, and novel cellular functions. In situ hybridization histochemistry identified strong mRNA labeling for BMP-4 and -7 in the theca cells and BMP receptor types IA, IB, and II in the granulosa cells and oocytes of most follicles in ovaries of normal cycling rats. To explore the paracrine function of this BMP system, we examined the effects of recombinant BMP-4 and -7 on FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone)-induced rat granulosa cytodifferentiation in serum-free medium. Both BMP-4 and -7 regulated FSH action in positive and negative ways. Specifically, physiological concentrations of the BMPs enhanced and attenuated the stimulatory action of FSH on estradiol and progesterone production, respectively. These effects were dose- and time-dependent. Furthermore, the BMPs increased granulosa cell sensitivity to FSH. Thus, BMPs have now been identified as molecules that differentially regulate FSH-dependent estradiol and progesterone production in a way that reflects steroidogenesis during the normal estrous cycle. As such, it can be hypothesized that BMPs might be the long-sought """"luteinization inhibitor"""" in Graafian follicles during their growth and development. """,0
170,15350998,[Oxcarbazepine and DRESS syndrome: a paediatric cause of acute liver failure],"Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, also called hypersensitivity reaction, is a severe idiosyncratic reaction to drugs, especially to anti-epileptic drugs.

171,29786049,Lipoxin A4 Ameliorates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced A549 Cell Injury through Upregulation of N-myc Downstream-Regulated Gene-1,"Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) can alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome through promoting epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression in lung epithelial cells. However, how LXA4 promote ENaC expression is still largely elusive. The present study aimed to explore genes and signaling pathway involved in regulating ENaC expression induced by LXA4. A549 cells were incubated with LPS and LXA4, or in combination, and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of ENaC-α/γ. Candidate genes affected by LXA4 were explored by transcriptome sequencing of A549 cells. The critical candidate gene was validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis of A549 cells treated with LPS and LXA4 at different concentrations and time intervals. LXA4 receptor (ALX) inhibitor BOC-2 was used to test induction of candidate gene by LXA4. Candidate gene siRNA was adopted to analyze its influence on A549 viability and ENaC-α expression. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was utilized to probe whether the PI3K signaling pathway was involved in LXA4 induction of candidate gene expression. The A549 cell models of ALI were constructed and subjected to transcriptome sequencing. Among candidate genes, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1) was validated by real-time-PCR and Western blot. NDRG1 mRNA was elevated in a dose-dependent manner of LXA4, whereas BOC-2 antagonized NDRG1 expression induced by LXA4. NDRG1 siRNA suppressed viability of LPS-treated A549 cells (treatment vs. control, 0.605 ± 0.063 vs. 0.878 ± 0.083, P = 0.040) and ENaC-α expression (treatment vs. control, 0.458 ± 0.038 vs. 0.711 ± 0.035, P = 0.008). LY294002 inhibited NDRG1 (treatment vs. control, 0.459 ± 0.023 vs. 0.726 ± 0.020, P = 0.001) and ENaC-α (treatment vs. control, 0.236 ± 0.021 vs. 0.814 ± 0.025, P < 0.001) expressions and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 phosphorylation (treatment vs. control, 0.442 ± 0.024 vs. 1.046 ± 0.082, P = 0.002), indicating the PI3K signaling pathway was involved in regulating NDRG1 expression induced by LXA4. Our research uncovered a critical role of NDRG1 in LXA4 alleviation of LPS-induced A549 cell injury through mediating PI3K signaling to restore ENaC expression. ",0

It mostly causes asymptomatic elevation of liver transaminases. """"Elevation in liver enzymes to what extent should preclude further treatment?"""" or """"Is only a dose-reduction sufficient?"""" are questions yet to be answered. The present article uses a case report to discuss the treatment alternatives when liver enzymes reach three times the upper normal limits during the clozapine therapy. METHODS: In the following case report, the authors describe a 27-year-old male patient diagnosed with schizophrenia, resistant to different atypical and typical antipsychotics. Based on the pathological findings of our patient and a review of the literature, the author summarizes the reasons for the liver enzymes increase and treatment alternatives during clozapine treatment. RESULTS: Substantial improvement was achieved with clozapine therapy. Increase in liver enzymes at the beginning of the clozapine treatment was successfully managed with a multidisciplinary approach: the treatment was initially withdrawn, afterwards restarted, and carefully continued. CONCLUSION: The authors demonstrate that clozapine may be cautiously continued in selected patients who showed marked psychiatric improvement with clozapine in the face of liver enzyme elevation.""",1

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this extraction technique is applied to the analysis of UV filters in sand samples, and in other kind of environmental solid samples. Main extraction parameters such as the fibre coating, the amount of sample, the addition of salt, the volume of water added to the sand, and the temperature were optimized. An experimental design approach was implemented in order to find out the most favourable conditions. The final conditions consisted of adding 1 mL of water to 1 g of sample followed by the headspace SPME for 20 min at 100 °C, using PDMS/DVB as fibre coating. The SPME-GC-MS/MS method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, limits of detection and quantification, and precision.

174,18759708,"Maraviroc, risks and benefits: a review of the clinical literature","BACKGROUND: Maraviroc represents the first licensed CCR5 co-receptor antagonist from the new antiretroviral (ARV) drug-class of entry inhibitors. RESULTS: Results of Phase III clinical trials in three-drug-class experienced patients have presented maraviroc as a promising new agent for treatment of HIV-1-infection. Maraviroc (b.i.d./q.d.) + optimised background therapy (OBT) provided significantly superior virological control and CD4+ increases compared with placebo + OBT at 48 weeks, with no clinically relevant differences in the safety profile between the maraviroc and the placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Its proven efficacy in cases of virological failure and three-class ARV-drug resistance is a major benefit of maraviroc compared to the so far commercially available drugs from existing (non-) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ([N]NRTI) and protease inhibitors drug-classes, particularly in times of increasing ARV drug resistance. Moreover, the tolerability profile of the drug makes maraviroc particularly appealing as a combination partner in ARV therapy. As maraviroc however is only effective against CCR5-tropic HIV-1, tropism testing is required before initiation of treatment. Tropism-testing possibilities are still limited, and presently only possible at high costs. The main constraints to be considered in the clinical use of maraviroc are the declining number of CCR5-tropic patients with advanced HIV-1 disease owing to tropism-shifting and the occurrence of drug-drug interactions, requiring regular dose adaptations. The true clinical value of this new substance and its future role in the treatment of HIV-1-infection remains to be defined by further data from clinical studies and by future experiences of practitioners.",1
175,10410179,Hepatotoxicity possibly caused by amphotericin B,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of possible amphotericin B-induced hepatotoxicity in a patient with pulmonary blastomycosis. SUMMARY: A 26-year-old white man with life-threatening pulmonary blastomycosis developed elevation of his liver enzymes after the addition of amphotericin B to his initial itraconazole therapy. The hepatotoxicity resolved rapidly with discontinuation of the amphotericin B, and the blastomycosis was successfully treated with itraconazole alone. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates an unusual occurrence of hepatotoxicity associated with a short course of amphotericin B. Liver biopsy was compatible with drug-induced changes and showed no evidence of blastomycosis. Discontinuation of amphotericin B with no other therapeutic changes resulted in a rapid resolution of hepatotoxicity. A possible adverse drug interaction with itraconazole and amphotericin B is postulated based on the mechanism of action of each drug. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B therapy can be associated with many adverse effects, but reports of hepatotoxicity are rare.

Questionnaire. Qualified members of the dental team and those in training evaluated the usefulness of the application of a novel head mounted camera in their clinical teaching within Dundee Dental School and Hospital. A total of 210 questionnaires were issued and received for analysis. Although the device generally improved the level of detail observed by learners/teachers and improved the level of feedback given to learners, there was scope for improving upon image quality. The lighting of the environment in which the camera was used was a critical factor in optimising success. The different members of the dental team displayed different expectations of the device. This was attributed in part to their level of previous exposure to clinical work. In applying this technology it is therefore important to understand the needs of the user. The camera system did enhance the learning experience but required further refinement in relation to image quality. ",0
178,25575299,Bifunctional fatty acid chemical reporter for analyzing S-palmitoylated membrane protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells,"Studying the functions of S-palmitoylated proteins in cells can be challenging due to the membrane targeting property and dynamic nature of protein S-palmitoylation. New strategies are therefore needed to specifically capture S-palmitoylated protein complexes in cellular membranes for dissecting their functions in vivo. Here we present a bifunctional fatty acid chemical reporter, x-alk-16, which contains an alkyne and a diazirine, for metabolic labeling of S-palmitoylated proteins and photo-cross-linking of their involved protein complexes in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that x-alk-16 can be metabolically incorporated into known S-palmitoylated proteins such as H-Ras and IFITM3, a potent antiviral protein, and induce covalent cross-linking of IFITM3 oligomerization as well as its specific interactions with other membrane proteins upon in-cell photoactivation. Moreover, integration of x-alk-16-induced photo-cross-linking with label-free quantitative proteomics allows identification of new IFITM3 interacting proteins.  ",0
179,20812318,Increased natural killer cell cytotoxicity and NKp30 expression protects against hepatitis C virus infection in high-risk individuals and inhibits replication in vitro,"CD56(pos) natural killer (NK)/natural T (NT) cells are important innate effectors providing the first line of defense against viral infection. Enhanced NK activity has been shown to protect from human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. However, the role played by these innate effectors in protection against or development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. We characterized CD56(pos) populations in 11 injection drug users (IDUs) who remained uninfected despite being repeatedly exposed to HCV. NK profiles in exposed but uninfected (EU) individuals were compared with preinfection samples (median 90 days prior to HCV seroconversion) collected from 14 IDUs who were exposed and subsequently became infected (EI) and unexposed normal control subjects (n = 8). Flow cytometric analysis of CD56(pos) populations demonstrated that EUs had a higher proportion of CD56(low) mature (P = 0.0011) NK cells compared with EI subjects. Bead-isolated NKs ( > 90% purity) from EUs had significantly higher interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive cell line K562 at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1 (P < 0.0001). NKp30, a natural cytotoxicity receptor involved in NK activation, is highest on NK/NT cells in EUs relative to infected subjects. Using the JFH-1 infection system, we demonstrated that NKp30(high) cells in the absence of exogenous stimulation significantly reduce infection of hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: CD56(pos) populations in EUs are enriched for effector NKs displaying enhanced IL-2-induced cytolytic activity and higher levels of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp30-activating receptor. In addition, NKp30(high) cells are more effective in preventing infection of Huh-7.5 cells than their NKp30(low/neg) counterparts. These data support the hypothesis that NK cells contribute to anti-HCV defense in vivo in the earliest stages of infection, providing innate protection from HCV acquisition.",0
180,24399721,Association between the HLA-B*15:02 allele and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis in Han individuals of northeastern China,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the significant association between carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and HLA-B*15:02 in epilepsy patients of Han ethnicity living in northeastern China. METHODS: CBZ-SJS/TEN patients and CBZ-tolerant control patients were genotyped for HLA-B*15:02 by PCR amplification using sequence-specific primers. Patients then were evaluated for HLA genotypes using PCR with sequence-based typing. RESULTS: Eight of 35 CBZ-SJS/TEN patients carried HLA-B*15:02 (22.9%) versus 2 of 125 in CBZ-tolerant control patients (OR = 18.222, 95% CI = 3.662-90.662, p = 0.000). Our results suggest that HLA-B*15:02 is necessary but is not sufficient to produce SJS/TEN following CBZ treatment among Han individuals from northeastern China. Other HLA alleles, including A*33:03, B*58:01, C*03:02, DQB1*03:03, and DRB1*07:01 may be associated weakly with CBZ-SJS/TEN. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are not consistent with previous studies reporting a strong association between HLA-B*15:02 and CBZ-SJS/TEN among individuals from southern, southwestern, and central China. Other genes may be more tightly associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN. Screening for HLA-B*15:02 still may be recommended for patients in northeastern China before starting CBZ.",1

METHODS: A prospective and descriptive study carried out in Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Jagdalpur. The adverse effects were recorded on the personal record of every individual patient, filled during the course of treatment. RESULTS: 176 patient's records were analysed, looking for adverse effects. Among the 176 patients, 79 had adverse effects due to one or more components of MDT, 73 had adverse effects due to dapsone, eight due to rifampicin and 16 due to clofazimine. Mean (+/- SD) duration for the development of adverse effects from the start of therapy was 1.99 (+/- 0.69) months for dapsone, 36 (+/- 0.68) months for rifampicin and 7.13 (+/- 0.79) months for clofazimine. There was a significant (P < 0.05) correlation between adverse effects and low Body Mass Index (BMI). The suspected drug was stopped and an alternative regime started in nine patients; six had dapsone stopped, two had rifampicin stopped and one had clofazimine stopped. CONCLUSION: Adverse effects attributed to MDT are comparable to previous studies and we found that ADR due to Dapsone was very high but most of the ADR were managed by supportive treatment without replacing the suspected drug.""",1

Three cohorts of 3 (A), 3 (B), and 27 (C) patients received 4, once weekly, infusions of ofatumumab at the following doses: (A) one 100 mg and three 500 mg; (B) one 300 mg and three 1000 mg; (C) one 500 mg and three 2000 mg. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were Binet stage B, and the median number of previous treatments was 3. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The majority of related adverse events occurred at first infusion, and the number of adverse events decreased at each subsequent infusion. Seventeen (51%) of 33 patients experienced infections, 88% of them of grade 1-2. One event of interstitial pneumonia was fatal; all other cases resolved within one month. The response rate of cohort C was 50% (13/26), one patient having a nodular partial remission and 12 patients partial remission. In conclusion, ofatumumab was found to be well tolerated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in doses up to 2000 mg. Preliminary data on safety and objective response are encouraging and support further studies on the role of ofatumumab in CLL patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no.

184,19646443,"Lanreotide reduces the volume of polycystic liver: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Therapy for polycystic liver is invasive, expensive, and has disappointing long-term results. Treatment with somatostatin analogues slowed kidney growth in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and reduced liver and kidney volume in a PKD rodent model. We evaluated the effects of lanreotide, a somatostatin analogue, in patients with polycystic liver because of autosomal-dominant (AD) PKD or autosomal-dominant polycystic liver disease (PCLD). METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 2 tertiary referral centers. Patients with polycystic liver (n = 54) were randomly assigned to groups given lanreotide (120 mg) or placebo, administered every 28 days for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in total liver volume, measured by computerized tomography at weeks 0 and 24. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable for both groups, except that more patients with ADPKD were assigned to the placebo group (P = .03). The mean liver volume decreased 2.9%, from 4606 mL (95% confidence interval (CI): 547-8665) to 4471 mL (95% CI: 542-8401 mL), in patients given lanreotide. In the placebo group, the mean liver volume increased 1.6%, from 4689 mL (95% CI: 613-8765 mL) to 4895 mL (95% CI: 739-9053 mL) (P < .01). Post hoc stratification for patients with ADPKD or PCLD revealed similar changes in liver volume, with statistically significant differences in patients given lanreotide (P < .01 for both diseases).

185,21168497,Efficiency of laryngeal motor nerve repair is greater with bulbar than with mucosal olfactory ensheathing cells,"The real ability of OECs provided by olfactory mucosa cultures (OM-OECs) and those from olfactory bulb cultures (OB-OECs) must be better characterized in order to propose their future clinical application. Therefore, we used a lesion of the vagus nerve (VN), which constitutes a severe motor denervation due to long distance of the muscular targets (4.5 cm). We performed a section/anastomosis surgery of the VN, at the third tracheal ring. Then, OM-OECs and OB-OECs were injected in matrigel around the lesion site. Three months after surgery, laryngeal muscle activity, synkinesis phenomena and latency were evaluated by videolaryngoscopy and electromyography recordings. To complete these procedures, axonal morphometric study of the right recurrent nerve was performed to assess axonal regrowth and tracking of green fluorescent protein positive cells was performed. Recurrent nerve is the motor branch innervating the laryngeal muscles, and is located distally to the lesion, near the muscular targets (0.7 cm). These analyses permitted to compare the ability of these two populations to improve functional recovery and axonal regrowth. Our results show that, OM-OECs improved electrical muscular activity and nervous conduction with significant tissue healing but induced aberrant movement and poor functional recovery. In contrast, OB-OECs induced a partial functional recovery associated with an increase in the number of myelinated fibers and nervous conduction. Our study suggests that, as recently reported in a microarray study, OM-OECs and OB-OECs express different properties. In particular, OM-OECs could regulate inflammation processes and extracellular matrix formation but have a poor regeneration potential, whereas, OB-OECs could improve functional recovery by inducing targeted axonal regrowth.

Treatment strategies for DILI are still not well defined. AIM: We studied the safety and outcomes of steroid/ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA) combination therapy in DILI patients. PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 consecutive patients with severe DILI were analyzed for clinical, biochemical and histological data. Nine patients were treated with a steroid step-down therapy with reduction of the daily dose over several weeks; 6 patients received a steroid pulse therapy for 3 days. UDCA was administered for several weeks in both groups. RESULTS: Patients without histological signs of preexistent liver damage (n = 10) showed the most favorable clinical course. Bilirubin and serum transaminases dropped to <50% of peak values within 2 weeks, and normalized within 4-8 weeks. In contrast, patients with positive autoimmune antibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies and/or soluble liver antigen) and/or histological features of chronic hepatitis (n = 3) exhibited a slower reduction in bilirubin and serum transaminase levels. These patients were given immunosuppressants (steroids, azathioprine) for a further 6 months. CONCLUSION: Treatment of severe DILI with corticosteroids (both pulse and step-down therapy) and UDCA appears to be safe, and leads to a more rapid reduction in bilirubin and transaminases after DILI.""",1
188,11507291,Tl-201 chloride and Tc-99m MIBI accumulation in lung adenocarcinoma in patients with and without distant metastases,"The relation between Tl-201 chloride accumulation by the tumor and its distant metastatic potential were evaluated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and compared with the same parameters achieved using Tc-99m MIBI. Fifty-six patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma were examined before therapy was begun. They were classified according to the radiologic findings and pathologic diagnosis into two groups: distant metastases and no distant metastases. All patients underwent dual-isotope imaging with Tl-201 chloride and Tc-99m MIBI. Regions of interest were placed over the tumor uptake (T) and contralateral normal lung tissue (N) areas on one transverse view with clearly defined lesions, and the T:N ratio and retention index were calculated. The early and delayed T:N ratios and retention index using Tl-201 chloride SPECT in the distant-metastases group were significantly greater (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05) than were those in the no-distant-metastases group. There was no significant correlation between the T:N ratio and retention index and distant metastatic potential using Tc-99m MIBI SPECT. Tl-201 chloride SPECT may be more effective than Tc-99m MIBI SPECT for evaluating the distant metastatic potential of primary lung adenocarcinoma. ",0
189,17986579,Debating the influence of self-reports by people living with chronic disease on healthy aging and longevity,"For people living with chronic disease, decision-making in relation to their health and lifestyle choices is an integral aspect to managing the complexity that living with chronic disease brings into their lives. Research findings reveal that people living with chronic disease can self-report what may seem to be appropriate explanations for their health status and seem to be in control of their health in their efforts to master the constraints imposed by their life situation. Precisely because ignoring disease-related changes may actually contribute to disease progression, it is imperative to know whether self-reports are made linking biomedical understandings of their disease with the person's social situation and life events. To understand how to influence choices made by people living with chronic disease to promote healthy aging and longevity, it is imperative for health and social care professionals to learn how to question people's self-reports, given that self-reports are often used as evidence in practice and research to inform clinical solutions.

191,8843810,Post-malaria neurological syndrome,"Neurological signs and symptoms are common in malaria, but observations in Vietnam and Thailand have pointed to a discrete transient neurological syndrome after recovery from severe infections. A prospective study of the post-malaria neurological syndrome (PMNS) was conducted at two centres in Vietnam over four years. Criteria for inclusion were recent symptomatic malaria infection with parasites cleared from blood (and in cases of cerebral malaria full recovery of consciousness), and development of neurological or psychiatric symptoms within two months after the acute illness. Half of the patients with severe falciparum malaria had been taking part in a randomised trial of antimalarials. Of 18,124 patients with falciparum malaria treated (1176 of whom had severe infections) 19 adults and three children had subsequent PMNS; in one patient it followed uncomplicated malaria and in 21 it followed severe malaria. The overall incidence (95% confidence interval) of PMNS after falciparum malaria at the main study centre was 1.2 per 1000 (0.7 to 1.8 per 1000) and relative risk (95% CI) for developing PMNS after severe versus uncomplicated falciparum malaria was 299 (40 to 2223). 13 patients had an acute confusional state or psychosis, six had one or more generalised convulsions, two had generalised convulsions followed by a long period of acute confusion, and one developed a fine tremor. At the time of PMNS diagnosis all patients were aparasitaemic. The syndrome was self-limiting, median duration 60 h (range 24-240). PMNS was associated with the use of oral mefloquine. In the randomised trial 4.4% (10/228) of patients with severe malaria who received mefloquine after parenteral treatment developed PMNS compared with 0.5% (1/210) of those who received quinine; relative risk 9.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 71.3, p = 0.012). Mefloquine is not the only risk factor for PMNS but it is a strong one. Where an effective alternative drug is available, mefloquine should not be used after treatment of severe malaria. ",0

After successful PCI for acute myocardial infarction 40-50% of patients show persistent ST-segment elevation indicating suboptimal myocardial reperfusion. Adenosine has been studied to ameliorate reperfusion and is frequently used in a variety of doses, but there are no prospective studies to support its use for treatment of suboptimal reperfusion. We conducted a blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled study with high dose intracoronary adenosine in 51 patients with <70% ST-segment resolution (STRes) after successful primary PCI. All patients were treated with stents and abciximab. Immediately after adenosine, significantly more patients showed optimal (>70%) STRes compared with placebo (33% versus 9%, P < 0.05). Mean STRes was higher after adenosine (35.4% versus 23.0%, P < 0.05). In addition, TIMI frame count was significant lower (15.7 versus 30.2, P < 0.005), Myocardial Blush Grade was higher (2.7 versus 2.0, P < 0.05) and resistance index was lower in the adenosine group (0.70 versus 1.31 mm Hg per ml/min, P < 0.005).

For the AT preparations gained from a plasma pool at least semiquantitative information on the isoform-distributions could be gained. Unlike to the commonly used approaches starting from enzymatically treated glycoproteins, this approach deals with intact proteins. The high accuracy of the molecular mass determination obtained by the ion-trap analyzer allows one to calculate and ascertain the carbohydrate composition assuming no variations in the protein moiety of AT and to exclude or confirm the presence of the potential post-translational or other modifications. Therefore, the direct coupling of CZE with ESI-MS does not only represent a fast alternative technique to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) but serves as a method which provides structural information complementary to that gained from peptide mapping methods.

We studied trichome distribution and the molecular variation of GL1 in 28 A. thaliana accessions. Trichome density on rosette leaves was highly variable among those accessions. On the molecular level, we detected substantial sequence variation in a 3-kb fragment which included the complete coding region of the GL1 locus (pi = 0.01). Phylogenetic analysis of GL1 indicates the presence of two diverged clades among 28 accessions. Using ANOVA, we show that the phenotypic variation in trichome density cannot be explained by the sequence divergence between the two phylogenetic lineages. Sequence analysis of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata accessions indicates that all amino acid substitutions are located outside of the conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains R2 and R3. Using plants of A. thaliana and A. lyrata with either naturally occurring or ethyl methane sulfonate--induced glabrous phenotypes, we demonstrate that the last 14 C-terminal amino acids of the GL1 gene have no major impact on the initiation of trichomes.

198,26174697,Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein is predominantly derived from Kupffer cells,"The role of Kupffer cells (KCs) in the pathophysiology of the liver has been firmly established. Nevertheless, KCs have been underexplored as a target for diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases owing to the lack of noninvasive diagnostic tests. We addressed the hypothesis that cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is mainly derived from KCs and may predict KC content. Microarray analysis of liver and adipose tissue biopsies, obtained from 93 obese subjects who underwent elective bariatric surgery, showed that expression of CETP is markedly higher in liver than adipose tissue. Hepatic expression of CETP correlated strongly with that of KC markers, and CETP messenger RNA and protein colocalized specifically with KCs in human liver sections. Hepatic KC content as well as hepatic CETP expression correlated strongly with plasma CETP concentration. Mechanistic and intervention studies on the role of KCs in determining the plasma CETP concentration were performed in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model expressing human CETP. Selective elimination of KCs from the liver in CETP Tg mice virtually abolished hepatic CETP expression and largely reduced plasma CETP concentration, consequently improving the lipoprotein profile. Conversely, augmentation of KCs after Bacille-Calemette-Gu�rin vaccination largely increased hepatic CETP expression and plasma CETP. Also, lipid-lowering drugs fenofibrate and niacin reduced liver KC content, accompanied by reduced plasma CETP concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma CETP is predominantly derived from KCs, and plasma CETP level predicts hepatic KC content in humans.",0
199,3262199,A case-control study of chorioamnionic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis in prematurity,"To study the role of infection in prematurity, we studied the demographic and obstetrical characteristics, chorioamnionic cultures, and placental histologic features of women who delivered prematurely and compared these findings with those in women who delivered at term. Microorganisms were isolated from the area between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). The most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were Ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and Gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). The recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). When multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). The proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. We conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.",0
200,21851881,Diagnostic work-up and risk stratification in X-linked dilated cardiomyopathies caused by dystrophin defects,"We sought to describe the diagnostic work-up, phenotype, and long-term evolution of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) associated with Dystrophin (DYS) defects. X-linked DCM associated with DYS defects can be clinically indistinguishable from other types of DCM. The series comprises 436 consecutive male patients diagnosed with DCM. Patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Genetic testing employed multiplex polymerase chain reaction and multiple ligation dependent probe assay for deletions and direct sequencing of the 79 exons and flanking regions of the gene for point mutations or small rearrangements. We identified DYS defects in 34 of 436 patients (7.8%) (onset age 34 ± 11 years, age range 17 to 54 years); 30 had proven X-linked inheritance. The 2 phenotypes included DCM with mild skeletal myopathy and/or increased serum creatine phosphokinase (n = 28) or DCM only (n = 6). The EMB showed defective dystrophin immunostain. The DYS defects consisted of 21 in-frame deletions and 11 out-of-frame deletions as well as 1 stop and 1 splice-site mutation. During a median follow-up of 60 months (interquartile range: 11.25 to 101.34 months) we observed 17 events, all related to heart failure (HF) (median event-free survival: 83.5 months). Eight patients (23%) underwent transplantation, and 9 (26%) died of HF while waiting for transplantation. Eight patients received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, although none had device intervention during a median follow-up of 14 months (interquartile range: 5 to 25 months). No patient died suddenly, suffered syncope, or developed life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. DYS-related DCM should be suspected in male patients with increased serum creatine phosphokinase (82%) and X-linked inheritance. The disease shows a high risk of end-stage HF but a lower risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. ",0
201,1152895,Editorial: Perinatology begins before conception,"The liberalization of an abortion law in Oregon has resulted in the decline of fetal deaths and the prevention of maternal mortality. Since then the total population including that in the childbearing years has been steadily on the increase while the known conception rate has been decreasing by about 5% per year. While much progress has been made in identifying high-risk pregnancies and dealing more effectively with them, little progress has been made toward influencing events in the first half of pregnancy. Guerrero and Rojas have examined the outcome of pregnancy using basal temperature records to estimate ovulation time. Their findings have led to the belief that aging of sperm (before fertilization) or aging of eggs (before insemination) increases the probability of spontaneous abortion. In addition, overripeness may also lead to chromosomal abnormalities and to babies with Down's syndrome. However, proof is clearly lacking at this moment; careful testing is presently necessary. If proven true, prevention of such defects would be possible by educating people to juxtapose fertilization as close to ovulation time as possible.",0
202,25895618,Recent advances in the treatment of hyperammonemia,"Ammonia is a neurotoxic agent that is primarily generated in the intestine and detoxified in the liver. Toxic increases in systemic ammonia levels predominantly result from an inherited or acquired impairment in hepatic detoxification and lead to potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric symptoms. Inborn deficiencies in ammonia detoxification mainly affect the urea cycle, an endogenous metabolic removal system in the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy, on the other hand, is a hyperammonemia-related complication secondary to acquired liver function impairment. A range of therapeutic options is available to target either ammonia generation and absorption or ammonia removal. Therapies for hepatic encephalopathy decrease intestinal ammonia production and uptake. Treatments for urea cycle disorders eliminate ammoniagenic amino acids through metabolic transformation, preventing ammonia generation. Therapeutic approaches removing ammonia activate the urea cycle or the second essential endogenous ammonia detoxification system, glutamine synthesis. Recent advances in treating hyperammonemia include using synergistic combination treatments, broadening the indication of orphan drugs, and developing novel approaches to regenerate functional liver tissue. This manuscript reviews the various pharmacological treatments of hyperammonemia and focuses on biopharmaceutical and drug delivery issues.",1
203,19582440,Influence of clinical and genetic factors on warfarin dose requirements among Japanese patients,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of clinical and genetic factors on warfarin dose requirements in the Japanese population. We enrolled 125 patients on stable warfarin anticoagulant therapy with an international normalized ratio maintained between 1.5 and 3.0. PCR-based methods were performed to analyze genetic polymorphisms in the genes pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically related to warfarin reactions, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) and factor VII (FVII). The presence of CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1-1639G>A had a significant impact on the mean maintenance dose of warfarin (CYP2C9*1/*1 2.74 +/- 1.24 mg/day vs. *1/*3 and *3/*3 1.56 +/- 0.85 mg/day, P = 0.009; VKORC1-1639AA 2.42 +/- 0.95 mg/day vs. GA 3.71 +/- 1.43 mg/day vs. GG 7.25 +/- 0.35 mg/day, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression model, the combination of age, body surface area, and genotypes of CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1-1639G>A explained 54.8% of the variance in warfarin dose requirements. The influences of CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1-1639G>A on the maintenance dose of warfarin were well-defined in Japanese patients, while polymorphisms of GGCX and FVII did not affect it. The model established in this study might provide us most likely individual maintenance dose based on clinical and genetic backgrounds. ",0

205,21143497,Understanding lactic acidosis in paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning,"""Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most commonly taken drugs in overdose in many areas of the world, and the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the UK and USA. Paracetamol poisoning can result in lactic acidosis in two different scenarios. First, early in the course of poisoning and before the onset of hepatotoxicity in patients with massive ingestion; a lactic acidosis is usually associated with coma. Experimental evidence from studies in whole animals, perfused liver slices and cell cultures has shown that the toxic metabolite of paracetamol, N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine, inhibits electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and thus inhibits aerobic respiration. This occurs only at very high concentrations of paracetamol, and precedes cellular injury by several hours. The second scenario in which lactic acidosis can occur is later in the course of paracetamol poisoning as a consequence of established liver failure. In these patients lactate is elevated primarily because of reduced hepatic clearance, but in shocked patients there may also be a contribution of peripheral anaerobic respiration because of tissue hypoperfusion. In patients admitted to a liver unit with paracetamol hepatotoxicity, the post-resuscitation arterial lactate concentration has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality, and is included in the modified King's College criteria for consideration of liver transplantation. We would therefore recommend that post-resuscitation lactate is measured in all patients with a severe paracetamol overdose resulting in either reduced conscious level or hepatic failure.""",1
206,2998610,High incidence of amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in human squamous carcinoma cell lines,"Southern blot-hybridization analysis of DNAs from human tumors demonstrated amplification of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene in 10 of 12 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines tested and in none of 18 tumor cell lines of nonsquamous cell carcinomas. The degree of amplification in the squamous cells varied from 2- to 50-fold relative to the epidermal keratinocyte. Hybridization analysis of the RNA showed that the amplification of the EGF receptor gene is accompanied with an increase of the 5.6 kilobases of EGF receptor mRNA. Scatchard plot analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the EGF receptor revealed that the synthesis of the EGF receptor is also greater in the cells with amplified EGF receptor gene. In contrast, Southern blot analysis of DNAs of primary tumors showed that incidence of amplification of the EGF receptor gene in squamous cells (1 of 6) was almost as frequent as in nonsquamous cells (1 of 4). These results show that amplification of the EGF receptor gene is commonly found in various tumors. In addition, our data suggest that primary squamous cell carcinomas with amplified EGF receptor gene may readily adapt to growth in tissue culture. ",0
207,21823520,Comparison of methimazole and propylthiouracil in the management of children and adolescents with Graves' disease: efficacy and adverse reactions during initial treatment and long-term outcome,"""OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and adverse reactions during initial treatment and long-term outcome between children and adolescents with Graves' disease (GD) treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and those treated with methimazole (MMI). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective and collaborative study. Children and adolescents with GD were divided into group M (MMI: n=64) and group P (PTU: n=69) and into four subgroups by initial dose: group M1 (<0.75 mg/kg of MMI, n=34), group M2 (> or = 0.75 mg/kg, n=30), group P1 (<7.5 mg/kg of PTU, n=24) and group P2 (> or = 7.5 mg/kg, n=45). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The duration for normalization of serum T4 on initial treatment, the incidence of adverse effects for one year and outcomes at 10 years after were compared. RESULTS: Mean durations for normalization of T4 (+/- SD) were 1.7 +/- 1.0 months in group M and 2.3 +/- 2.4 in group P [not significant (NS)], while the mean duration in group P1 (3.1 +/- 3.3) was significantly longer than those in the other subgroups (M1: 1.9 +/- 1.2; M2: 1.4 +/- 0.7; P2; 1.7 +/- 1.3). No major adverse reaction was observed. Minor adverse effects occurred in 25.0% of cases in group M and 31.9% in group P (NS). The incidence in group P2 (44.4%) was significantly higher than those in group M1 (20.6%) and group P1 (8.3%). Remission rates did not differ between the MMI-treated group (35.0%, n=20) and PTU-treated group (50.0%, n=40). CONCLUSIONS: PTU may not be suitable for initial use in children and adolescents with GD, even with the risk of major adverse reactions such as liver failure excluded.""",1
208,27701080,Cobimetinib,"OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize data on cobimetinib, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 for use in combination with vemurafenib for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or V600K mutation. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the terms cobimetinib, MEK inhibitor, and melanoma from January 2000 to June 2016. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The literature search was confined to human studies published in English. Trials of cobimetinib for melanoma were prioritized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. Its FDA approval was based on a phase III, randomized trial of vemurafenib monotherapy (n = 248) or vemurafenib and cobimetinib (n = 247) in unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation. Cobimetinib was administered as 60 mg orally daily for 21 days/7 days off, whereas vemurafenib was administered as 960 mg twice daily. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib were associated with an objective response rate of 68%, and median progression-free survival of 9.9 months. The overall survival was not reached at the time of first interim analysis. Clinically relevant grade ?3 adverse events were diarrhea (6%), rash (6%), photosensitivity (2%), elevated liver function tests (LFTs) (8%-12%), increased creatine kinase (11%), and retinal detachment (3%). CONCLUSION: Cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib is an alternative BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600 mutation. The role of cobimetinib in melanoma and other solid tumors is likely to expand as the results from ongoing studies become available.",1

210,17922899,"Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy from randomized controlled trials of 1 and 2 mg nicotine bitartrate lozenges (Nicotinell)","""BACKGROUND: The use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can almost double the chances of success for smokers to quit. Nevertheless, there is still a considerable number of cessation attempts that are made without any treatment. This novel oral formulation, (lozenge containing nicotine bitartrate dihydrate) has been developed to enlarge the offer for efficient smoking cessation drug therapies, assuming that increasing treatment options will bring more smokers to find the support they personally need to stop smoking. METHODS: Three pharmacokinetic (PK), one safety and two efficacy studies were carried out with Nicotinell lozenges. PK trials were: (1) a single-dose, three-way crossover study comparing 1 and 2 mg lozenges with 2 mg nicotine gum; (2) a multiple-dose, two-way crossover study comparing 1 mg lozenge with 2 mg gum; (3) a multiple-dose, three-way crossover study comparing 1 and 2 mg lozenges with 4 mg gum. Safety trial: (4) a single dose study to assess the safety of swallowing up to 12 lozenges containing 1 mg nicotine. Efficacy trials: two efficacy studies in (5) France and (6) the USA, including more than 900 smokers followed-up for up to one year, conducted with the 1 mg lozenge. RESULTS: The results of the individual PK trials showed that the 1 mg Nicotinell lozenge is bioequivalent to 2 mg polacrilex gum, as demonstrated by similar blood PK parameters (tmax, Cmax, AUC). The 2 mg lozenge was found to deliver quantities of nicotine that were intermediate between those delivered by 2 and 4 mg polacrilex gum. The short-term efficacy of the 1 mg lozenge in comparison with placebo was also demonstrated with significantly more subjects continuously abstinent from smoking with active lozenges on week 6 in two different populations: moderate to heavy smokers (FTND between 4 and 7) OR = 1.72 [95% CI: 1.05-2.80]; heavy to very heavy smokers (FTND 6 and over) OR = 2.87 [95% CI: 1.18-6.97]. Nicotinell lozenges were found to be safe with mainly mild and reversible adverse events. The safety of the 1 mg lozenge formulation, even when misused was also demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The data presented in this review demonstrate high nicotine bioavailability, excellent safety profile and proven short-term efficacy of Nicotinell lozenges. At nominal equivalent doses 1 and 2 mg Nicotinell lozenges were shown to deliver larger amounts of bioavailable nicotine compared to the nicotine polacrilex gum. According to the data developed here, the systemic exposure to nicotine could be ranked: 4 mg polacrilex gum > 2 mg Nicotinell lozenge > 1 mg Nicotinell lozenge = 2 mg polacrilex gum.Adverse events observed during the clinical trials were mild or moderate in severity, transient and completely reversible. With respect to efficacy in smoking cessation, significantly higher continuous abstinence rates were achieved with lozenge compared to placebo. In conclusion, Nicotinell lozenges offer a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium available for smoking cessation.""",1
211,9187066,Postmenopausal hormone therapy and mortality,"BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal hormone therapy has both benefits and hazards, including decreased risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of breast cancer. METHODS: We examined the relation between the use of postmenopausal hormones and mortality among participants in the Nurses' Health Study, who were 30 to 55 years of age at base line in 1976. Data were collected by biennial questionnaires beginning in 1976 and continuing through 1992. We documented 3637 deaths from 1976 to 1994. Each participant who died was matched with 10 controls alive at the time of her death. For each death, we defined the subject's hormone status according to the last biennial questionnaire before her death or before the diagnosis of the fatal disease; this reduced bias caused by the discontinuation of hormone use between the time of diagnosis of a potentially fatal disease and death. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding variables, current hormone users had a lower risk of death (relative risk, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.70) than subjects who had never taken hormones; however, the apparent benefit decreased with long-term use (relative risk, 0.80; 0.67 to 0.96, after 10 or more years) because of an increase in mortality from breast cancer among long-term hormone users. Current hormone users with coronary risk factors (69 percent of the women) had the largest reduction in mortality (relative risk, 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.57), with substantially less benefit for those at low risk (13 percent of the women; relative risk, 0.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: On average, mortality among women who use postmenopausal hormones is lower than among nonusers; however, the survival benefit diminishes with longer duration of use and is lower for women at low risk for coronary disease.",0

213,8843674,Kinetic study on the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-proline dipeptides,"The equilibrium and kinetic parameters of cis-trans interconversion of dipeptides containing peptidyl-proline moiety were investigated using the in-column incubation method with both CZE and HPLC and the ad hoc dissolution method. The use of the latter was possible because the conformational make-up of the solid peptides, and consequently of their ad hoc solution, was sufficiently different from that of the solution at equilibrium. This method with 1H-NMR and CZE analyses yielded very similar results for the cis-trans isomerization of Phe Pro in aqueous sodium borate, pH 8.4, at 10 degrees C with an average value of 0.34 and 6.6 x 10(-5) s-1 for the equilibrium and rate constant, respectively. The in-column incubation method is performed by CZE or HPLC so that the conformers are separated in the first half of the column and then incubated in column where they interconvert and reach equilibrium. Subsequent separation in the second half of the column yielded four peaks. Thus by measuring the conformer composition as a function of the reaction time, the rate constant can be evaluated. The forward rate constant of 1.42 x 10(-4) s-1 determined by the CZE in-column incubation method for Phe-Pro isomerization at 10 degrees C was twice of the value obtained by the ad hoc dissolution method. It is believed that the inner wall of fused-silica capillaries has a catalytic effect on the isomerization. Computer simulation was also employed to gain further insight on the catalytic activity of the capillary inner wall on such isomerization. Whereas the experimental and simulation profiles of Phe-Pro in aqueous borate buffer, pH 8.4, with a 37 cm long capillary were in excellent agreement, a four times faster interconversion rate had to be used to match the experimental profile obtained with a 57 cm long capillary under otherwise identical conditions. The catalytic effect of the octadecyl silica stationary phase on the isomerization was confirmed by the in-column incubation method with HPLC. The overall rate of the cis-trans isomerization of Phe-Pro, which entails the reaction both on the stationary phase and in the mobility phase, was about six times faster at 0 degree C than the rate measured by NMR in free solution using the mobile phase containing 65% (v/v) sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 35% (v/v) methanol. The results presented here serve as a caveat that the effect of the wall in CZE or the stationary phase in HPLC on the reaction cannot be ignored. ",0
214,11642133,Four new mutations and polymorphic variants of the low density lipoprotein receptor in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia in Saint Petersburg],"In a collection of DNA samples from 100 unrelated patients with clinical features of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a search for mutations of exons 4 and 10 of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene was performed using heteroduplex and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analyses followed by sequencing of amplified DNA fragments. Four new mutations of the LDL receptor gene were identified: C146R (c.499 T > C), A130P (c.451 G > C), G128G (c.477 T > C), and C188Y (c.626 G > A). Mutation A130P was assigned to the same chromosome with allele variant 447C. Two polymorphic sites in exon 10 of the LDL receptor gene (1413G/A and 1545C/T) were found in the Russian population for the first time. Based on the data obtained, familial hypercholesterolemia was confirmed in seven patients. ",0
215,12379063,Short-course rifampin and pyrazinamide compared with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection: a multicenter clinical trial,"""BACKGROUND: Rifampin and pyrazinamide are recommended for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in adults without HIV infection, but reports of severe hepatotoxicity have raised concerns about its safety. Clinical trials have not compared this treatment with isoniazid in adults without HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and tolerance of a 2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide with that of a 6-month regimen of isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, open-label trial. SETTING: Three urban public health tuberculosis clinics in the United States. PATIENTS: 589 adults with latent tuberculosis infection who met U.S. criteria for treatment. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned in alternate weeks to receive rifampin and pyrazinamide daily for 2 months (n = 307) or isoniazid daily for 6 months (n = 282). MEASUREMENTS: Primary end points were hepatotoxicity, other adverse events, and percentage of patients who completed treatment. RESULTS: Sixteen of 207 (7.7%) patients assigned to rifampin and pyrazinamide developed grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity compared with 2 of 204 (1%) patients assigned to isoniazid (odds ratio, 8.46 [95% CI, 1.9 to 76.5]; P = 0.001). The rifampin plus pyrazinamide regimen was more likely than the isoniazid regimen to be discontinued because of hepatotoxicity (odds ratio, 5.19; P = 0.033). The overall percentage of nonhepatotoxic adverse events was 20% in the rifampin-pyrazinamide group and 16% in the isoniazid group. The proportion of patients who completed the study treatment was 61% and 57%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide was associated with an increased risk for grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity compared with a 6-month regimen of isoniazid. Liver enzymes should be measured routinely during treatment to screen for liver injury and prevent progression to severe toxicity.""",1
216,18525043,Socioeconomic inequalities in health in 22 European countries,"BACKGROUND: Comparisons among countries can help to identify opportunities for the reduction of inequalities in health. We compared the magnitude of inequalities in mortality and self-assessed health among 22 countries in all parts of Europe. METHODS: We obtained data on mortality according to education level and occupational class from census-based mortality studies. Deaths were classified according to cause, including common causes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer; causes related to smoking; causes related to alcohol use; and causes amenable to medical intervention, such as tuberculosis and hypertension. Data on self-assessed health, smoking, and obesity according to education and income were obtained from health or multipurpose surveys. For each country, the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes was measured with the use of regression-based inequality indexes. RESULTS: In almost all countries, the rates of death and poorer self-assessments of health were substantially higher in groups of lower socioeconomic status, but the magnitude of the inequalities between groups of higher and lower socioeconomic status was much larger in some countries than in others. Inequalities in mortality were small in some southern European countries and very large in most countries in the eastern and Baltic regions. These variations among countries appeared to be attributable in part to causes of death related to smoking or alcohol use or amenable to medical intervention. The magnitude of inequalities in self-assessed health also varied substantially among countries, but in a different pattern. CONCLUSIONS: We observed variation across Europe in the magnitude of inequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status. These inequalities might be reduced by improving educational opportunities, income distribution, health-related behavior, or access to health care.",0
217,17538967,Glucocorticoid signaling synchronizes the liver circadian transcriptome,"Circadian control of physiology is mediated by local, tissue-based clocks, synchronized to each other and to solar time by signals from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master oscillator in the hypothalamus. These local clocks coordinate the transcription of key pathways to establish tissue-specific daily metabolic programs. How local transcriptomes are synchronized across the organism and their relative contribution to circadian output remain unclear. In the present study we showed that glucocorticoids alone are able to synchronize expression of about 60% of the circadian transcriptome. We propose that synchronization occurs directly by the action of glucocorticoids on a diverse range of downstream targets and indirectly by regulating the core clock genes mPer1, Bmal1, mCry1, and Dbp. We have identified the pivotal liver transcription factor, HNF4alpha, as a mediator of circadian and glucocorticoid-regulated transcription, showing that it is a key conduit for downstream targeting. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that by orchestrating transcriptional cascades, glucocorticoids are able to direct synchronization of a diverse range of functionally important circadian genes.",0
218,2536896,Racial differences in drug response. Altered sensitivity to and clearance of propranolol in men of Chinese descent as compared with American whites,"To determine whether the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of beta-blockade differ among racial groups, we gave 10 men of Chinese descent and 10 American white men 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of propranolol every eight hours; the dosages were given in random order, and each dose was given for one day. The degree of beta-blockade was measured as the reduction in the heart rate and blood pressure in the supine and upright positions and during treadmill exercise testing. The Chinese subjects had at least a twofold greater sensitivity to the beta-blocking effects of propranolol than the white subjects, as indicated by the mean (+/- SEM) plasma concentrations producing a 20 percent reduction in the heart rate in both the supine position (197 +/- 31 vs. 536 +/- 58 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05) and the upright position (131 +/- 27 vs. 343 +/- 39 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05) and after exercise testing (96 +/- 12 vs. 185 +/- 23 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05). In addition, the Chinese subjects had much greater sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of propranolol, as shown by the concentrations that reduced blood pressure by 10 percent in the supine position (73 +/- 5 vs. 748 +/- 7 nmol per liter; P less than 0.01) and in the upright position (89 +/- 5 vs. 401 +/- 6 nmol per liter; P less than 0.01). No difference in beta-receptor density or affinity of lymphocytes was found between the groups. The Chinese group had a 45 percent higher free fraction of propranolol in plasma, which may have contributed to the increased drug effect but cannot explain it entirely. This group metabolized propranolol more rapidly than the white group, which resulted in a 76 percent higher clearance of an oral dose (3740 +/- 737 vs. 2125 +/- 214 ml per minute; P less than 0.05) because of increased metabolism through multiple metabolic pathways. We conclude that Chinese men have greater sensitivity than white men to the effects of propranolol on heart rate and blood pressure. Decreased protein binding may be responsible in part, but most of the effect remains to be explained.",0

The authors review clinical data relevant to antidepressant-induced liver injury and provide recommendations for clinical practice. METHOD: A PubMed search was conducted for publications from 1965 onward related to antidepressant-induced liver injury. The search terms were """"liver injury,"""" """"liver failure,"""" """"DILI,"""" """"hepatitis,"""" """"hepatotoxicity,"""" """"cholestasis,"""" and """"aminotransferase,"""" cross-referenced with """"antidepressant."""" RESULTS: Although data on antidepressant-induced liver injury are scarce, 0.5%-3% of patients treated with antidepressants may develop asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferase levels. All antidepressants can induce hepatotoxicity, especially in elderly patients and those with polypharmacy. Liver damage is in most cases idiosyncratic and unpredictable, and it is generally unrelated to drug dosage. The interval between treatment initiation and onset of liver injury is generally between several days and 6 months. Life-threatening antidepressant-induced liver injury has been described involving fulminant liver failure or death. The underlying lesions are often of the hepatocellular type and less frequently of the cholestatic and mixed types. The antidepressants associated with greater risks of hepatotoxicity are iproniazid, nefazodone, phenelzine, imipramine, amitriptyline, duloxetine, bupropion, trazodone, tianeptine, and agomelatine. The antidepressants that seem to have the least potential for hepatotoxicity are citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. Cross-toxicity has been described, mainly for tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. CONCLUSIONS: Although an infrequent event, DILI from antidepressant drugs may be irreversible, and clinicians should be aware of it. Aminotransferase surveillance is the most useful tool for detecting DILI, and prompt discontinuation of the drug responsible is essential. The results of antidepressant liver toxicity in all phases of clinical trials should be available and published. Further research is needed before any new and rigorously founded recommendations can be made.""",1
220,21098156,Therapeutic acetaminophen is not associated with liver injury in children: a systematic review,"""BACKGROUND: Concern exists about the potential for liver injury with therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen in children. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed the medical literature to determine the rate at which liver injury has been reported for children prescribed therapeutic doses of acetaminophen (?75 mg/kg per day orally or intravenously or ?100 mg/kg per day rectally). METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to locate all studies in which acetaminophen was administered to a defined pediatric population for ?24 hours and for all case reports of liver injury after therapeutic acetaminophen dosing. Trained reviewers extracted data from each report. Major and minor hepatic adverse events (AEs) were defined prospectively. Causality was assessed by using the Naranjo algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 62 studies that enrolled 32,414 children were included. No child (0% [95% confidence interval: 0.000-0.009]) was reported to have exhibited signs or symptoms of liver disease, to have received an antidote or transplantation, or to have died. Major or minor hepatic AEs were reported for 10 children (0.031% [95% confidence interval: 0.015-0.057]). The highest transaminase value reported was 600 IU/L. Naranjo scores (2-3) suggested """"possible"""" causation. Twenty-two case reports were identified. In 9 cases, the Naranjo score suggested """"probable"""" causation (5-6). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatoxicity after therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen in children is rarely reported in defined-population studies. Case reports suggest that this phenomenon may occur, but few reports contain sufficient data to support a probable causal relationship.""",1

222,24328326,Simple nanoparticle-based luminometric method for molecular weight determination of polymeric compounds,A nanoparticle-based method utilizing time-resolved luminescence resonance energy transfer (TR-LRET) was developed for molecular weight determination. This mix-and-measure nanoparticle method is based on the competitive adsorption between the analyte and the acceptor-labeled protein to donor Eu(III) nanoparticles. The size-dependent adsorption of molecules enables the molecular weight determination of differently sized polymeric compounds down to a concentration level of micrograms per liter. The molecular weight determination from 1 to 10 kDa for polyamino acids and from 0.3 to 70 kDa for polyethylene imines is demonstrated. The simple and cost-effective nanoparticle method as microtiter plate assay format shows great potential for the detection of the changes in molecular weight or for quantification of differently sized molecules in biochemical laboratories and in industrial polymeric processes.  ,0

Primary HLECs were cultured either on cryopreserved intact AM or plastic dishes for 2 weeks. Cells were labelled with 5 microM 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 3 days, followed by an interval of either 7 or 14 days in BrdU-free medium. The expression of p63 and BrdU labelling was detected by immunocytochemistry. More cells on AM (56%) than on plastic (24%) retained their BrdU label after the 7-day interval (p < 0.001). The difference was even more pronounced after 14 days (20 and 2%, p < 0.001). All BrdU-labelled cells were also p63 positive. 2.5-fold more cells on AM (54%) than on plastic (21%) were BrdU positive/p63 positive after 7 days (p < 0.001). It increased to a 9-fold difference after 14 days (p < 0.001). The BrdU label was lost more quickly than the p63 expression during the observation period, indicating that p63 expression was not confined to stem cells but existed also in transient amplifying cells. The combination of p63 expression and BrdU label retention is a better criterion to characterize stemness than either marker alone. AM as a culture substrate preserves stemness better than plastic.

225,17988531,The study of vascular lesion using ultrasound in children with a history of Kawasaki disease],"To explore the endothelial function, carotid artery stiffness index and carotid intima-media thickness in children with a history of Kawasaki disease (KD). A cohort of 204 children was studied, which comprised 51 patients with Kawasaki disease with coronary artery lesion (CAL group), 50 patients with Kawasaki disease with normal coronary arteries (normal coronary arteries group), and 103 healthy age matched children (control group). Their systemic blood pressure, fasting cholesterol concentrations, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, carotid artery stiffness index and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were compared. FMD of the brachial artery in CAL group (5.2% +/- 1.9%) and normal coronary arteries group (6.8% +/- 2.0%) were significantly lower than that of control group (13.2% +/- 4.1%, both P < 0. 01); carotid artery stiffness index in CAL group (4.0 +/- 0.6) was significantly greater than that of normal coronary arteries group (3.6 +/- 0.6) and control group (3.4 +/- 0.5, P = 0.05, P < 0.01); likewise, IMT in CAL group (0.447 mm +/- 0.024 mm) was significantly higher than that of normal coronary arteries group (0.426 mm +/- 0.016 mm) and control group (0.424 mm +/- 0.016 mm, both P < 0.01). In multiple linear regression analysis, age and patient grouping were significant determinants of carotid artery stiffness index, FMD and IMT. There were significant correlations between carotid artery stiffness index, FMD and IMT in both healthy group and KD group after adjustment of age. There were endothelial dysfunction and increased systemic arterial stiffness and IMT late after the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, carotid artery stiffness index combined carotid intima-media thickness can evaluated completely the prognosis of vascular lesion in convalescence after KD.

226,6454846,Pulmonary sarcoidosis: a disorder mediated by excess helper T-lymphocyte activity at sites of disease activity,"Using the monoclonal antibodies OKT4 and OKT8, we determined the proportions of helper and suppressor T cells in patients with sarcoidosis and high-intensity alveolitis, patients with sarcoidosis and low-intensity alveolitis, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and normal controls. In controls and patients with IPF, the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells was 1.8:1 in lungs and blood. In contrast, this ratio was 10.5:1 in lungs (P less than 0.001) and 0.8:1 in blood (P less than 0.05) in patients with sarcoidosis and high-intensity alveolitis. The ratio of helper to suppressor T cells was not higher in the lungs or blood of patients with sarcoidosis and low-intensity alveolitis; on the contrary, because of the higher proportions of suppressor cells, the ratio of helper to suppressor cells was lower in both lungs and blood. In studies of function, lung T cells from patients with sarcoidosis and high-intensity alveolitis released monocyte chemotactic factor (a lymphokine critical to granuloma formation) and polyclonally activated B cells to produce immunoglobulins. We conclude that one determinant of lung injury in sarcoidosis in the presence of large numbers of lung helper T cells, which are important in granuloma formation.",0
227,19304453,Ultrasound image texture analysis of the intima and media layers of the common carotid artery and its correlation with age and gender,"The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) is widely used as an early indicator of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It was proposed but not thoroughly investigated that the composition and texture of the media layer (ML) can be used as an indicator for the risk of stroke. In this study, we investigate the application of texture analysis of the ML of the CCA and how texture is affected by age and gender. The study was performed on 100 longitudinal-section ultrasound images acquired from asymptomatic subjects at risk of atherosclerosis. The images were separated into three different age groups, namely below 50, 50-60, and above 60 years old. Furthermore, the images were separated according to gender. A total of 61 different texture features were extracted from the intima layer (IL), the ML, and the intima-media complex (IMC). The ML and the IMC were segmented manually by a neurovascular expert and also automatically by a snakes segmentation system. We have found that male patients tended to have larger media layer thickness (MLT) values as compared to the MLT of female patients of the same age. We have found significant differences among texture features extracted from the IL, ML and IMC from different age groups. Furthermore, for some texture features, we found that they follow trends that correlate with a patient's age. For example, the gray-scale median GSM of the ML falls linearly with increasing MLT and with increasing age. Our findings suggest that ultrasound image texture analysis of the media layer has potential as an assessment biomarker for the risk of stroke. ",0
228,25565401,Forkhead box G1 gene haploinsufficiency: an emerging cause of dyskinetic encephalopathy of infancy,"14q12 deletions, including the Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) gene and point mutations of this gene, are associated with a complex encephalopathy described as a congenital variant of Rett syndrome. A mixture of jerks, athetosis, chorea, and dystonia is observed early in life in many patients. The aim of this article is to report on the spectrum of movement disorders associated with FOXG1 haploinsufficiency, as described in the literature. We provide a review of the cases reported in the literature, adding two new patients. We searched for a comprehensive set of clinical features, including age at onset and semiology of the movement disorder, occurrence and type of stereotypies, and neurological outcome. A total of 51 cases were included in our study. Nonepileptic abnormal movements occurred in 33 cases, often variably combined and presenting during the first year of life. The neurological phenotype of FOXG1 haploinsufficiency shows the features of a dyskinetic encephalopathy of infancy. ",0
229,24079055,Pancytopenia and lactic acidosis associated with linezolid use in a patient with empyema,"""OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient who developed pancytopenia and lactic acidosis after receiving linezolid therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 32-year-old man with past medical history of heart failure, hypertension received a 14-day course of linezolid for treatment of empyema with broncho-pleural fistula. During his follow up visit, he was found to be septic and further evaluation showed pancytopenia, acidosis and elevated liver enzymes. With the exclusion of other possible etiologies, the time course to development of these laboratory abnormalities correlated with the use of linezolid. Antibiotics were switched subsequently and the labs improved after reaching a nadir on the fourth day after stopping linezolid. DISCUSSION: Linezolid was noted to cause time and dose-dependent reversible myelosuppression in preclinical studies. There are several case reports of throinbocytopenia occurring with linezolid use, but only few cases of pancytopenia and lactic acidosis are reported. Exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown, but many hypothesize it to be similar to chloramphenicol marrow toxicity because of the cross-reactivity to mitochondrial ribosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of linezolid as a drug capable of causing pancytopenia, lactic acidosis and elevated liver enzymes. While recovery is usually complete following withdrawal of the drug, we need to still monitor for these rare but severe complications; and consider treating only for a shorter duration, if possible.""",1
230,23642703,Contribution of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms to the inflammation-induced increase in the evoked Ca2+ transient in rat cutaneous dorsal root ganglion neurons,"Persistent inflammation results in an increase in the magnitude and duration of high K(+)-evoked Ca(2+) transients in putative nociceptive cutaneous dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether recruitment of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) contributes to these inflammation-induced changes. Acutely dissociated, retrogradely labeled cutaneous DRG neurons from naïve and complete Freund's adjuvant inflamed adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied with ratiometric microfluorimetry. Ryanodine only attenuated the duration but not magnitude of the high K(+)-evoked Ca(2+) transient in neurons from inflamed rats. However, there was no significant impact of inflammation on the potency or efficacy of ryanodine-induced block of the caffeine-evoked Ca(2+) transient, or the impact of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) inhibition on the high K(+)-evoked Ca(2+) transient. Furthermore, while there was no change in the magnitude, an inflammation-induced increase in the duration of the caffeine-evoked Ca(2+) transient was only observed with a prolonged caffeine application. In contrast to the high K(+)-evoked Ca(2+) transient, there was no evidence of direct mitochondrial involvement or that of the Ca(2+) extrusion mechanism, the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, on the caffeine-evoked Ca(2+) transient, and block of SERCA only increased the duration of this transient. These results indicate the presence of Ca(2+) regulatory domains in cutaneous nociceptive DRG neurons within which cytosolic Ca(2+) increased via influx and release are highly segregated. Furthermore, our results suggest that changes in neither CICR machinery nor the coupling between Ca(2+) influx and CICR are primarily responsible for the inflammation-induced changes in the evoked Ca(2+) transient.

233,27605198,Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis triggered by drug-drug interaction with itraconazole,"A 47-year-old woman had been treated with high-dose simvastatin for several years. After systemic treatment with the antifungal agent itraconazole, she developed muscle pain and highly elevated levels of creatine kinase and myoglobin. Muscle biopsy was compatible with statin-associated rhabdomyolysis, probably caused by a drug-drug interaction between simvastatin and itraconazole. The patient made full recovery. Three commonly used statins-simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin-are metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Several potent inhibitors of this enzyme are known, for example, azole antifungal agents such as itraconazole and posaconazole. If antifungal treatment is indicated in a patient using a CYP3A4-metabolised statin, we recommend (1) topical administration of the antifungal agent if possible, (2) the use of a non-CYP3A4-inhibiting antifungal drug such as terbinafine or (3) temporary discontinuation of statin treatment.",1

Enhancement by prostaglandin E1,We studied the effect of prostaglandins in vitro on an immune reaction mediated by T cells; adherence of lymphocytes to measles-virus-infected human epithelial cells. Normal human lymphocytes adhered to a mean +/- S.D. 20.1 +/- 5.2 per cent of these HEp-2 cells. The percentage positive cells increased to 50.3 +/- 5.7 when lymphocytes were incubated with 10(-6) M prostaglandin E1 (P less than 0.01 vs. untreated lymphocytes); 10(-8) M and 10(-10) M were as effective. Prostaglandin F2alpha had no effect on lymphocyte adherence. Prostaglandin E1 increased lymphocyte cyclic AMP five to 10 times whereas prostagladin F2alpha did not affect cellular levels of this nucleotide. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-8) M) increased lymphocyte adherence: positive human epithelial cells increased from 16.0 +/- 2.4 to 38.7 +/- 1.1 per cent (P less than 0.01). Prostagladin E1 also increased adherence of lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from 21.8 +/- 5.8 to 52.5 +/- 9.2 per cent (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that prostagladin E1 and cyclic AMP may serve to stimulate T-cell function and cell-mediated immunity.,0
237,25256165,Group determination of 14-membered macrolide antibiotics and azithromycin using antibodies against common epitopes,"Erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), roxithromycin (ROX), and azithromycin (AZI) are macrolide antibiotics widely used in livestock and human medicine. Therefore, they are frequently found as pollutants in environmental water. A method based on indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for group determination of these macrolides in foodstuffs, human biofluids, and water was developed. Carboxymethyloxime of clarithromycin (CMO-CLA) was synthesized and conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and gelatin to prepare immunogen and coating antigen with advantageous presentation of target epitopes, l-cladinose and d-desosamine, common for these analytes. Antibodies generated in rabbits were capable of recognizing ERY, CLA, and ROX as a group (100-150%), and AZI (12%) and did not cross-react with ERY degradants, which lack antibiotic activity. Assay displayed sensitivity of determination of 14-membered macrolides (IC50=0.13-0.2ng/ml) and low limit of detection (LOD) that was achieved at 0.02 to 0.03ng/ml. It allowed performing analysis of milk, muscle, eggs, bovine serum, water, human serum and urine, and avoiding matrix effect without special pretreatment using simple dilution with assay buffer. For 15-membered macrolide AZI, the corresponding characteristics were IC50=1.6ng/ml and LOD=0.14ng/ml. The recoveries of veterinary and human medicine macrolides from corresponding matrices were validated and found to be satisfactory. ",0
238,2202637,Analysis of hepatic T lymphocyte and immunoglobulin deposits in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis,"The histological findings in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have been well-defined and are often used in the clinical staging of disease. However, it has only been with the development of reagents that phenotypically characterize the lymphoid infiltrate that attempts have been made to correlate pathophysiology with immune effector populations. Indeed, the inflammatory hepatic lesions in primary biliary cirrhosis have been described as containing CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells. Less clear, however, have been the T cell receptors in these lesions. Further, the data on immunoglobulin deposits in hepatic lesions have been less well-defined; this deficit may be a result of the quality of polyspecific sera and difficulties in background. To address these issues, we have used a battery of well-defined monospecific and polyspecific reagents to phenotypically define the occurrence of lymphoid cells in the livers of patients undergoing transplantation. Furthermore, we have defined these same markers on T cell lines derived from liver, regional lymph node and peripheral blood. The predominant cell type in the mononuclear infiltrate is the CD3+, CD4+ T lymphocyte bearing the T cell receptor alpha beta. T cell lines from the same patients demonstrate similar findings. Of special importance, however, was the detection of CD20+ B cells and Ig+ cells in the lymphoid infiltrate. Indeed, we also readily demonstrated the presence of immunoglobulin on the surface of biliary epithelium. These data suggest that mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of primary biliary cirrhosis may include both T cell and antibody mechanisms. The results also underscore the need to develop a functional, and not just a phenotypical, assay of the inflammatory infiltrate.",0
239,18615121,Risk for immune-mediated liver reactions by nevirapine revisited,"Implementation of combination antiretroviral therapies has transformed the prognosis of HIV infection during the past decade. Because of its low-pill burden, convenient administration once or twice daily without food restrictions and, in the case of nevirapine, favorable metabolic profile and proven safety in pregnant women and newborns, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been shown to be often superior to protease inhibitors as third agents in combination with a backbone of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor are currently the most popular used first-line therapies. Hepatotoxicity during the first weeks of therapy with nevirapine, particularly when initiated in women with CD4 counts > 250 cells/mm3, has prompted changes in guidelines and led to a modification in the product label. Recent data, however, suggest that virologically suppressed patients under any other antiretroviral drug combination may safely switch to nevirapine as a part of a simplification strategy, regardless of their current CD4 count. This subset of patients does not show an increased risk of hepatotoxicity or rash with elevated CD4 counts, as has been reported in drug-naive HIV persons. This information is important and may expand the number of candidates who could benefit from nevirapine use, since a substantial proportion of HIV patients show metabolic abnormalities (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, liver steatosis) and are at increased cardiovascular risk. Fortunately, many of these conditions may ameliorate or improve using nevirapine.",1
240,25007031,International confederation for cleft lip and palate and related craniofacial anomalies task force report: palatoplasty in the speaking individual with unrepaired cleft palate,"Introduction : The benefits or otherwise of late palate repair in older children or adults are uncertain. The outcomes, particularly without appropriate speech therapy, are often disappointing. The issue is of special importance in the poorer countries where these patients are most commonly seen and where limited capacity and facilities may have to be rationed. Method : A task force was set up to report back to the International Congress in Orlando in May 2013. The chairman and some members were nominated by the organizers and further members were added during the discussion process. Some of the members had considerable experience of late palate repair. The task force compiled a report after 9 months of e-mail correspondence. The report includes reports of some previously unpublished studies. A summary of the report was presented at Cleft 2013 in Orlando. Conclusions : There was a general consensus that late palate repair is of benefit for many patients and that, even if normal speech is not attained, outcomes are positive. Outcomes depend on the age of the patient (the younger the better), on the skill of the surgeon and, ideally, on the availability of appropriate speech therapy.

242,23190221,Ponatinib in refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias,"""BACKGROUND: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) is frequently caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks native and mutated BCR-ABL, including the gatekeeper mutant T315I, which is uniformly resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled 81 patients with resistant hematologic cancers, including 60 with CML and 5 with Ph-positive ALL. Ponatinib was administered once daily at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg. Median follow-up was 56 weeks (range, 2 to 140). RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects included elevated lipase or amylase levels and pancreatitis. Common adverse events were rash, myelosuppression, and constitutional symptoms. Among Ph-positive patients, 91% had received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 51% had received all three approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of 43 patients with chronic-phase CML, 98% had a complete hematologic response, 72% had a major cytogenetic response, and 44% had a major molecular response. Of 12 patients who had chronic-phase CML with the T315I mutation, 100% had a complete hematologic response and 92% had a major cytogenetic response. Of 13 patients with chronic-phase CML without detectable mutations, 100% had a complete hematologic response and 62% had a major cytogenetic response. Responses among patients with chronic-phase CML were durable. Of 22 patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, 36% had a major hematologic response and 32% had a major cytogenetic response. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib was highly active in heavily pretreated patients with Ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation, other mutations, or no mutations.

Although the histopathologic features have been reported, the cytomorphologic spectrum of myxofibrosarcoma has been far less documented. The cytologic findings of six fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens (five primaries, one local recurrence) from six patients are described. The patients' ages ranged from 26-77 yr; there were four women and two men. The aspiration biopsy specimens ranged from slightly to markedly cellular. Although a myxoid granular to filamentous background was observed at least focally in all cases, the volume of the myxoid material was inversely proportional to the cellularity and grade of the tumor. Individual tumor cells were round to spindled, often displaying a wide range of cell shapes and sizes. Nuclei were generally large, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic, frequently containing prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm ranged from scant to dense and tapering. Multinucleated tumor giant cells were occasionally observed. In general, low- and intermediate-grade myxofibrosarcomas were more easily recognized in cytologic preparations. In contrast, high-grade myxofibrosarcoma was more difficult to specifically subtype and not easily distinguished from other adult pleomorphic sarcomas. ",0

We investigated potential differences in protein expression between Picea abies ecotypes adapted to contrasting altitude conditions. Protein expression patterns were compared between needles and roots of 2-month-old P. abies seedlings by means of 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Proteins exhibiting differential expression between the 2 ecotypes were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 19 proteins exhibited qualitative or quantitative polymorphism between the 2 populations. These proteins exhibited organ-specific expression, and the level of interpopulation protein polymorphism was organ dependent. Among differentially expressed proteins, we identified proteins involved in photosynthesis, photorespiration, root tracheary element differentiation, and transmitochondrial membrane transport. Our results show that P. abies seedlings from locally adapted ecotypes exhibit consistent differences in protein expression. The expression polymorphism of some of these proteins has potential adaptive significance. ",0
246,24311525,Hypoglycemia in Kabuki syndrome,"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a congenital malformation disorder with a spectrum of clinical manifestations involving different organs. Until the identification of MLL2 gene mutation in 2010, the diagnosis was made only clinically by the characteristic facial features with other common and uncommon features. Hypoglycemia, although an uncommon feature in KS, is very important to be recognized, as early diagnosis and appropriate management will reduce further long-term neurologic morbidity in these patients. We report on four patients with KS presenting with persistent hypoglycemia. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was the cause of hypoglycemia in two out of four patients and one patient had growth hormone deficiency. The mechanism of the hypoglycemia in one patient is still unclear. Three out of these four patients were found to have mutation in the MLL2 gene. Our observations suggest that patients with KS may have hypoglycemia due to different mechanisms and that MLL2 gene may have a role in glucose physiology. ",0

Ninety participants with anorexia completed questionnaires at admission and four weeks into hospitalized treatment. Weight data was collected over this same period. At discharge, participants were categorized into completer (n = 38) or patient-initiated (n = 36) /staff-initiated (n = 16) premature termination groups. Significant differences between staff-initiated and patient-initiated discharge groups were found at admission. Staff initiated groups were on average older (p = .035), and more likely to have had prior compelled treatment (p = .039). At 4 weeks those in the patient-initiated group had put on weight at a faster rate (p = .032) and reported a decrease in alliance (p = .017). At discharge, staff initiated discharge demonstrated greater time in treatment (p = .001), greater weight gain (p = .027), and a higher discharge BMI (p = .013). At discharge, staff-initiated drop-outs had comparable end-of-treatment outcomes to those who completed treatment as planned. There are key differences between those who prematurely discharge themselves from treatment, compared to those who are prematurely discharged by clinical staff. Future research into drop-out needs to take into account and recognize these differences. ",0

Many existing health systems in the Northeast, Midwest, and West have formed ACOs, whereas implementation in Southern states has been slower. The study team conducted a survey of all physician members of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama to determine the likelihood of their participation in an ACO and their attitudes toward some of the characteristics, such as quality measures, regulations, and risks versus rewards. The team found that many physicians reported a lack of knowledge about these areas. Physicians who reported that they were either likely or not likely to participate overwhelmingly held unfavorable attitudes about ACOs. It would be advantageous for Alabama physicians to become more knowledgeable about ACOs in the case that they become a more predominant form of care delivery in the future.  ",0

A parallel form study was conducted at a large, Midwestern teaching hospital and a cancer center. Convenience sample of 159 subjects: 40 obstetrical, 60 oncological, 59 medical/surgical. Two instruments, the INVR and the INV-2, were administered approximately 30-60 minutes apart. One-half of the subjects completed the INVR first, and the other half completed the INV-2 first. Equivalency measures of reliability correlation coefficients for both instruments. A high rate of agreement was found in the responses between the two forms. In cases of clear disagreement, the responses to the INVR were more frequently consistent than the responses to the original form. INVR has tested reliability and is more user friendly for the patient and the healthcare provider. Nurses have a focal role in managing symptoms. Managing nausea, vomiting, and retching requires excellent assessment skills of the patient's personal symptom experience and knowledge of pharmacology. Efficient, cost-saving assessments require accurate self-report instruments that permit patients to quantify their symptom experiences. The INVR can provide a scientific base from which to prescribe and teach patients and may improve their quality of life. Reliable and valid self-reporting instruments are essential for managing these adverse symptoms. ",0
250,18563844,Loss of tolerance in C57BL/6 mice to the autoantigen E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase by a xenobiotic with ensuing biliary ductular disease,"There have been important advances in defining effector mechanisms for several human autoimmune diseases. However, for most human autoimmune diseases, the induction stage is less well defined and there are very few clues on etiology. Our laboratory has focused on defining the molecular basis of autoantibody recognition and epitope modification in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Our work has demonstrated that antibodies to mitochondria, the hallmark of disease, are directed against a very conserved site of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC-E2). We have also demonstrated that several chemical xenobiotics, chosen based on quantitative structural activity relationship analysis and rigorous epitope analysis, when coupled to the lysine residue that normally binds the lipoic acid cofactor of PDC-E2, reacts as well or better to PBC sera than native autoantigen. In the present studies, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with one such xenobiotic, 2-octynoic acid, coupled to bovine serum albumin and we followed the mice for 24 weeks. Animals were studied for appearance of histologic lesions as well as appearance of antibodies to PDC-E2, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, and splenic and liver lymphoid phenotyping by flow cytometry. Mice immunized with 2-octynoic acid manifest autoimmune cholangitis, typical mitochondrial autoantibodies, increased liver lymphoid cell numbers, an increase in CD8(+) liver infiltrating cells, particularly CD8(+) T cells that coexpress CD44, and finally an elevation of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. CONCLUSION: these data provide a persuasive argument in favor of an environmental origin for human PBC.",0

Amniotic fluid analysis from a third amniocentesis performed 24 hours after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment revealed only a few white blood cells and was negative for microorganisms. The pregnancy continued for 22 days after admission, at which time spontaneous labor began. The neonate survived with no sequelae and had negative blood cultures. Antibiotic treatment was associated with eradication of Ureaplasma urealyticum from the amniotic cavity, pregnancy prolongation, and neonatal survival. ",0

Guidelines from different organizations are not all in agreement with regard to screening and antiviral prophylaxis, given the limited evidence. Antiviral prophylaxis has been recommended for all HBV surface antigen-positive patients. Evidence for benefit from prophylaxis has recently been recognized among HBV surface antigen-negative/HBV core antibody-positive patients. Incidence of HBV reactivation varies in different geographical locations and the decision to start antiviral prophylaxis should consider local incidence data. Given the increased rates of rituximab-associated HBV reactivation and potentially fatal outcome, it is prudent that all patients who receive rituximab should be screened for HBV markers.",1

After glycerin administration, serum osmolality increased rapidly, reaching a plateau within 15 minutes. Perilymph osmolality lagged significantly behind the increase of serum osmolality and equalled serum osmolality only after one hour. While perilymph osmolality responded to changes of serum osmolality, there was some time lag noted in the response of perilymph, suggesting the existence of a blood-labyrinth barrier. It was observed that this barrier is permeably to glycerin and water, suggesting the possibility of transient reduction of hydrostatic pressure in the labyrinth by the injection of an osmotic agent into the systemic circulation.

This multicenter, noncomparative, open-label phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous omacetaxine in CML patients with resistance or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); results in patients in chronic phase are reported here. Patients received subcutaneous omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m? twice daily days 1-14 every 28 days until hematologic response (up to a maximum of six cycles), then days 1-7 every 28 days as maintenance. Primary endpoints were rates of hematologic response lasting >8 weeks and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Forty-six patients were enrolled: all had received imatinib, 83% had received dasatinib, and 57% nilotinib. A median 4.5 cycles of omacetaxine were administered (range, 1-36). Hematologic response was achieved or maintained in 31 patients (67%); median response duration was 7.0 months. Ten patients (22%) achieved MCyR, including 2 (4%) complete cytogenetic responses. Median progression-free survival was 7.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.9-8.9 months], and overall survival was 30.1 months (95% CI, 20.3 months-not reached). Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity included thrombocytopenia (54%), neutropenia (48%), and anemia (33%). Nonhematologic adverse events were predominantly grade 1/2 and included diarrhea (44%), nausea (30%), fatigue (24%), pyrexia (20%), headache (20%), and asthenia (20%). Subcutaneous omacetaxine may offer clinical benefit to patients with chronic-phase CML with resistance or intolerance to multiple TKI therapies.""",1

A chart review study,"""Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been used in the treatment of numerous psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. The question of whether risperidone-induced weight gain is associated with steatohepatitis has recently been raised. The purpose of this chart review was to ascertain: (1) the rate of liver dysfunction observed during risperidone treatment in children and adolescents; and (2) the clinical factors associated with liver dysfunction. For purposes of this chart review study, abnormal liver function was defined by serum transaminase or bilirubin values falling outside the normal laboratory ranges. Chart reviews were completed on 38 youths with ages ranging from 5-17 years with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. The mean length of risperidone treatment was 15.2 months at a mean dose of 2.5 mg/day. It was found that 37 of the 38 youths treated with risperidone had no liver enzyme abnormalities at the end of study. One subject had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 46 U/L which was 7 U/L above the upper limit of normal for this laboratory test. This isolated value was not considered clinically significant. These data were noted in spite of weight gain and the use of numerous concomitant psychotropic medications. These findings suggest that risperidone in short term treatment does not commonly lead to evidence of abnormal liver function at therapeutic doses in children and adolescents. Larger-scale, prospective studies are needed in order to confirm these findings.""",1

STUDY DESIGN: Routine female patients seeking treatment for overactive bladder (n=221) in a urology/gynecology outpatient clinic. Data on adverse events, cardiovascular outcomes, condition specific symptoms and drug discontinuation was collected at two months follow-up (FU). Non-parametric statistics was used as appropriate. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcome association analyses using logistic regression. RESULTS: 16 patients (7.2%) discontinued treatment because of side effects. There were no significant associations between cardiovascular adverse events and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.3-2.6), or pre-existing ECG abnormalities (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.3-16.3). At FU ECGs there were no de novo cases of tachyarrhythmias and no significant difference in mean QTc between baseline (403ms, SD 21.7) and the 2 months follow-up ECG (403ms, SD 20.3) (p=0.75). There was a significant decrease in the mean systolic blood pressure (p=0.03) but no significant change in mean diastolic pressure (p=0.8) or heart rates (p=0.2) from baseline to FU. Overactive bladder specific symptoms and quality of life improved significantly (p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mirabegron treatment is associated with a satisfactory cardiovascular safety profile, as well as, significant symptomatic improvement also in a heterogeneous population of non-selected women with overactive bladder presenting in everyday clinical practice.",1

259,21167894,TNF-α and IL-1β mediate Japanese encephalitis virus-induced RANTES gene expression in astrocytes,"Infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes neuroinfection and neuroinflammation characterized by profound neuronal destruction/dysfunction, concomitant microgliosis/astrogliosis, and production of various molecules that initiate the recruitment of immune cells to the sites of infection. Previously, we reported that glial cells expressed RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) with chemotactic activity in response to JEV infection. In this study, we further demonstrated that JEV-infected microglia had an additional activity in regulating RANTES production. Both astrocytes and microglia responded to JEV infection by releasing RANTES through a process likely related to viral replication. Independent of infectious virus, supernatants of JEV-infected microglia, but not JEV-infected astrocytes, caused additional RANTES production from astrocytes. Antibody neutralization studies suggested the potential involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in mediating additional RANTES production. Treatment of astrocyte cultures with TNF-α and IL-1β caused activation of several signaling molecules and transcription factors crucial to RANTES gene expression, including reactive oxygen species, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, NF-κB, and NF-IL6, increased RANTES gene promoter activity, and provoked RANTES production. As with RANTES, neutralization of bioactive TNF-α and IL-1β caused an attenuation of chemotactic activity from supernatants of mixed glia containing astrocytes and microglia during the course of JEV infection. In conclusion, TNF-α and IL-1β produced by JEV-infected microglia might trigger another mechanism which induces a secondary wave of RANTES gene expression by activating astrocytes. The released RANTES from glial cells might play a role in the recruitment of immune cells during JEV infection. ",0
260,2956520,Lack of association between spermicide use and trisomy,"It has been suggested that the maternal use of spermicidal contraceptives increases the frequency of certain congenital anomalies, including trisomy, but this issue is in dispute. This controversy led us to examine whether the use of spermicidal contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of fetal trisomy. A questionnaire concerning contraceptive use was completed by 13,729 women who were undergoing prenatal fetal chromosome studies but were as yet unaware of the results. Most women were at increased risk of having a trisomic fetus because of their advanced age. Of 154 fetuses with trisomy, 98 had trisomy 21. For each woman (case) with an affected fetus, four controls were selected from among women with chromosomally normal fetuses, matched for maternal age and medical center. Cases and controls were compared by matched-sample maximum-likelihood logistic regression, to examine the association between fetal trisomy and four measures of spermicide use: periconceptional use, timing of last use, duration of last use, and total lifetime use. No evidence was found for an association, either when all types of trisomy were combined or when trisomy 21 alone was considered. All point estimates of odds ratios relating spermicidal exposure to trisomy were approximately 1, and an effect greater than a twofold increase was excluded with 95 percent confidence in the combined-trisomy group for all measures of spermicide use.",0
261,3957235,Elevated serum aminotransferase induced by isoniazid in relation to isoniazid acetylator phenotype,"""Of 143 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis receiving isoniazid therapy, 52 (36%) had a transient elevation in serum aminotransferases. Among 74 patients taking isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin, 35 (47%) had such an increase, while of 69 patients taking isoniazid, amino-salicylic acid and streptomycin, 17 (24%) did; this difference was significant. Isoniazid therapy could be continued in all patients with the abnormal test results. In 36 of the patients receiving isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin, isoniazid and its metabolites were studied in the serum and urine using high-performance liquid chromatography after the oral administration of 10 mg per kg of isoniazid. We had chosen for this test 18 patients with normal aminotransferase levels and 18 with abnormal levels. There were 14 rapid acetylators in the patients with abnormal aminotransferase levels and 7 rapid acetylators in the patients with normal levels; this difference was significant. These results indicate that liver dysfunction is more often caused by an isoniazid/rifampicin regimen, and patients who are rapid acetylators are more susceptible.""",1
262,6340972,Fentiazac in rheumatoid arthritis: comparison with sulindac and long-term tolerance,"Forty patients with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis were entered for 3 months in a double-blind trial, 20 patients on 400 mg fentiazac or 200 mg sulindac daily. Statistically significant improvements on fentiazac were reported during the course of the study for 3 of 7 parameters: pain score, total joint score and number of swollen joints, while for sulindac a significant improvement was reported for 6 parameters: pain score, grip strength, joint size, total joint score, number of swollen joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Side-effects were reported during the 3-month comparative period for 3 patients receiving fentiazac, consisting of rash, headache, epigastric pain, and for 1 patient receiving sulindac who suffered from gastro-intestinal intolerance. Because of ineffectiveness and/or side-effects, the treatment had to be discontinued for 5 patients in the fentiazac group and for 3 in the sulindac treatment group. The results support earlier evidence that fentiazac and sulindac have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties controlling disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, sulindac being the more effective. During a long-term tolerance study, 3 of 33 patients continued on fentiazac developed a reversible hepatotoxicity possibly due to the drug.",1
263,15367725,Muscle pain associated with daptomycin,"""OBJECTIVE: To report a case of muscle pain without pronounced creatine kinase (CK) elevation in a patient receiving daptomycin. CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old African American woman had antibiotic intolerance to vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. She presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis that was treated with intravenous daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily for 14 days. The patient developed muscle aches and pains with only a minor elevation (492 U/L) of CK; both resolved after daptomycin was discontinued. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin is a newly approved lipopeptide antibiotic derived from Streptomyces roseosporus with rapid bactericidal activity. Daptomycin has excellent coverage against gram-positive bacteria. The adverse effect profile has included rare reports of myopathy and elevated CK levels. Daptomycin is a promising agent with many potential applications. Once-daily dosing has diminished the preclinical incidence of myopathy. The current package labeling recommends discontinuation of daptomycin with significant myopathy symptoms in association with a CK elevation >1000 U/L or in patients without muscle pain and a CK >10 times normal. CONCLUSIONS: An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was possibly related to daptomycin. Clinicians should recognize that significant myopathy with daptomycin can occur without pronounced CK elevation.""",1
264,21851551,Significance of histological prostatitis in patients with urinary retention and underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma of the prostate,"To compare the clinical features of patients having urinary retention and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with those having adenocarcinoma of the prostate (ACP) and to evaluate the significance of histological prostatitis. The clinical data and histopathology reports of patients with retention admitted to Tygerberg Hospital between September 1998 and June 2007 were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Prostatic histology was available in 405 patients, 204 with BPH and 201 with ACP. Comparing those with BPH and those with ACP showed statistically significant differences in mean age (69.5 vs 71.9 years), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (18.6 vs 899.5 ng/mL) and histological prostatitis (48 vs 25%) but not duration of catheterization, prostate volume or urinary tract infection (UTI). Comparing those with BPH only and those with BPH plus prostatitis showed significant differences in mean age (71.9 vs 67.1 year) and PSA level (14.6 vs 22.8 ng/mL) but not prostate volume, UTI or duration of catheterization. Comparing those with ACP only and those with ACP plus prostatitis showed significant differences in stage T4 cancer (68.1 vs 35.4%) and PSA level (1123.4 vs 232.4 ng/mL) but not age, prostate volume, UTI or duration of catheterization. Histological prostatitis was almost twice as common in patients with urinary retention associated with underlying BPH than in patients with ACP, but there was no significant difference in the duration of catheterization, prostatic volume or presence of UTI, suggesting that histological prostatitis more often contributes to the development of retention in patients with underlying BPH than in those with ACP. In patients with BPH, histological prostatitis was associated with urinary retention at a significantly younger age and with higher serum PSA levels. In patients with ACP, histological prostatitis was associated with urinary retention at an earlier stage of cancer. ",0

Recently, strong associations of HLA-B*1502 and HLA-B*5801 with carbamazepine- and allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions were found in Han Chinese patients, respectively, but ethnic differences in the associations have been reported. The objective of this study is to clarify the involvement of HLA-B*1502 and HLA-B*5801 in Japanese SJS/TEN patients. METHODS: HLA-B genotyping was performed on 58 Japanese SJS/TEN patients between July 2006 and April 2008 from multicenters in Japan. RESULTS: There were no HLA-B*1502 carriers among 58 SJS/TEN patients. This patient group included seven carbamazepine-related and 11 aromatic anti-epileptic agent-related SJS/TEN patients. In addition, there were five HLA-B*5801 carriers, which included four allopurinol-related SJS/TEN patients. CONCLUSION: While HLA-B*1502 is unlikely to be associated with carbamazepine-related or aromatic anti-epileptic agent-related SJS/TEN, HLA-B*5801 was significantly associated with allopurinol-related SJS/TEN in Japanese.",1

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram evidenced normal extrahepatic biliary ducts. The percutaneous liver biopsy showed marked cholestasis specially in the centrolobular zone with a slight infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the portal areas. Together with the liver disease the patient presented an anemic syndrome. Bone marrow aspiration showed rich cellularity, Perls staining showed 70% sideroblasts, with 10% ringed sideroblasts and increased extracorpuscular iron. The patient's evolution was satisfactory. Twenty months after the beginning of the disease clinical and biochemical tests were normal. A new bone marrow aspiration rendered normal. Hepatic cholestasis suffered by our patient was probably due to an adverse reaction of methimazole. Physiopathology of reversible sideroblastic anemia is discussed.",1
267,19583451,Varenicline: a novel pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation,"Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries. Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified. In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 1 mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150 mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators. In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 1 mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation. Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation.",1

Eculizumab, a humanized anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, inhibits terminal complement activation, reduces hemolysis, decreases the risk of thrombosis, and improves renal function and quality of life in PNH patients. The long-term efficacy and safety of eculizumab in Japanese patients were assessed in a 2-year extension to a 12-week, open-label study (AEGIS). Eculizumab treatment led to an immediate and sustained reduction in intravascular hemolysis (P < 0.001) and red blood cell transfusions (P = 0.0016) compared with baseline levels. There were no reports of thromboembolism during eculizumab treatment. The majority of patients had stable (56 %) or improved (41 %) renal function and an improved quality of life (P = 0.015), with sustained reductions in fatigue and dyspnea. Eculizumab was well tolerated; no deaths or serious hemolytic events were reported, and the rate of infections declined over time. There were no significant differences in the response to eculizumab in patients with or without bone marrow dysfunction. These results demonstrate that eculizumab is an effective, well-tolerated long-term treatment for Japanese PNH patients and leads to continued amelioration of some hemolytic complications.""",1

METHODS: This prespecified pooled analysis of three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies, evaluated efficacy and safety of once-daily mirabegron 25 mg (safety analysis), 50 or 100 mg (efficacy and safety analyses) and tolterodine ER 4 mg (safety analysis) for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). Co-primary efficacy measures were change from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h and mean number of micturitions/24 h. Key secondary efficacy end-points included mean number of urgency episodes/24 h and mean volume voided/micturitions, while other end-points included patient-reported outcomes according to the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analogue Scale (TS-VAS) and responder analyses [dry rate (posttreatment), >/= 50% reduction in incontinence episodes/24 h, </= 8 micturitions/24 h (post hoc analysis)]. The safety analysis included adverse event (AE) reporting, laboratory assessments, ECG, postvoid residual volume and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate). RESULTS: Mirabegron (50 and 100 mg once daily) demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with placebo for the co-primary end-points, key secondary efficacy variables, TS-VAS and responder analyses (all comparisons p < 0.05). Mirabegron is well tolerated and demonstrates a good safety profile. The most common AEs (>/= 3%) included hypertension, nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection (UTI); the incidence of hypertensive events and UTIs decreased with increasing dose. For mirabegron, the incidence of the bothersome antimuscarinic AE, dry mouth, was at placebo level and of a lesser magnitude than tolterodine.

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of allergen-impermeable bed covers involving 1122 adults with asthma. The primary outcomes were the mean morning peak expiratory flow rate over a four-week period during the run-in phase and at six months and the proportion of patients who discontinued inhaled corticosteroid therapy as part of a phased-reduction program during months 7 through 12. Der p1 was measured in mattress dust in a 10 percent random subsample of homes at entry and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The prevalence of sensitivity to dust-mite allergen was 65.4 percent in the group supplied with allergen-impermeable bed covers (active-intervention group) and 65.1 percent in the control group supplied with non-impermeable bed covers. The concentration of Der p1 in mattress dust was significantly lower in the active-intervention group at 6 months (geometric mean, 0.58 microg per gram vs. 1.71 microg per gram in the control group; P=0.01) but not at 12 months (1.05 microg per gram vs. 1.64 microg per gram; P=0.74). The mean morning peak expiratory flow rate improved significantly in both groups (from 410.7 to 419.1 liters per minute in the active-intervention group, P<0.001 for the change; and from 417.8 to 427.4 liters per minute in the control group, P<0.001 for the change). After adjustment for base-line differences (by analysis of covariance), there was no significant difference between the groups in the peak expiratory flow rate at six months (difference in means, active-intervention group vs. control group, -1.6 liters per minute [95 percent confidence interval, -5.9 to 2.7] among all patients [P=0.46] and -1.5 liters per minute [95 percent confidence interval, -6.9 to 3.9] among mite-sensitive patients [P=0.59]). There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion in whom complete cessation of inhaled corticosteroid therapy was achieved (17.4 percent in the active-intervention group and 17.1 percent in the control group) or in the mean reduction in steroid dose, either among all patients or among mite-sensitive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Allergen-impermeable covers, as a single intervention for the avoidance of exposure to dust-mite allergen, seem clinically ineffective in adults with asthma.",0
277,29187190,"Ethical considerations in forensic genetics research on tissue samples collected post-mortem in Cape Town, South Africa","The use of tissue collected at a forensic post-mortem for forensic genetics research purposes remains of ethical concern as the process involves obtaining informed consent from grieving family members. Two forensic genetics research studies using tissue collected from a forensic post-mortem were recently initiated at our institution and were the first of their kind to be conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. This article discusses some of the ethical challenges that were encountered in these research projects. Among these challenges was the adaptation of research workflows to fit in with an exceptionally busy service delivery that is operating with limited resources. Whilst seeking guidance from the literature regarding research on deceased populations, it was noted that next of kin of decedents are not formally recognised as a vulnerable group in the existing ethical and legal frameworks in South Africa. The authors recommend that research in the forensic mortuary setting is approached using guidance for vulnerable groups, and the benefit to risk standard needs to be strongly justified. Lastly, when planning forensic genetics research, consideration must be given to the potential of uncovering incidental findings, funding to validate these findings and the feedback of results to family members; the latter of which is recommended to occur through a genetic counsellor. It is hoped that these experiences will contribute towards a formal framework for conducting forensic genetic research in medico-legal mortuaries in South Africa. ",0
278,7383128,Sounding board. The politics of contraception: the view from Beijing,"""Since China contains 1/4 of the world's population, what happens there with regard to limitation of fertility has significance for the whole world. Over the past decade, much has changed in China insofar as politics and the practice of birth control are concerned. At present, China is the only Communist country to support and practice an antinatalist policy, and, in fact, maintains the most stringent antinatalist policy in the world. The national aim has become the 1-child family, and there are strong incentives (food, health care, etc,) towards this end. To achieve this, China has directed much technical effort towards contraceptive production. Original Chinese products have been the paper pill in which the steroids are absorbed on water-soluble paper and Anordrin, a synthetic steroid known as the """"vacation pill."""" A significant contribution also by the Chinese is a male contraceptive pill derived from gossypol. This particular contraceptive has been associated with serious side effects and it remains to be seen whether this work will result in a useful antifertility agent for men. The author suggests that it is now time to encourage collaboration between Western and Chinese researchers, especially since the Chinese have taken the initiative in enlisting interaction with foreign scientific groups, especially with the Special Programme of Research, Development, and Research Training in Human Reproduction of WHO. WHO is presently setting up 2 institutes of research on methods to control fertility in Shanghai and Beijing and Chinese scientists are involved in the WHO task forces on IUDs, orals, and postcoital and plant agents.

Forty-two patients(M:F = 30:12; mean age, 59.9 years) with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were treated with HAI using a totally implantable vascular access port system from July 1994 to March 1999. The regimen used here was so-called weekly high-dose 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) infusion(5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2/week). Volume measurement of the liver demonstrated not only whole liver atrophy including the tumor but also volume reduction of the non-tumorous lobe. Atrophic change of the liver was seen in patients who were administered over 20 g/m2 of 5-FU(p < 0.01). The CT attenuation values of the liver were examined, and fatty infiltration was seen in six patients. Histologic examination of liver biopsies from the non-tumorous part revealed steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the portal triad, which were not seen in specimens prior to HAI. On clinical laboratory findings, enzymes representing bile duct, including alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino peptidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, were increased in 22 patients. In terms of regional toxicity for long-term HAI, 20 g/m2 of 5-FU, is the key dose at which to consider temporary cessation or dose reduction.""",1

285,23639577,"Prevalence, size, number and localization of vascular anastomoses in monochorionic placentas","Most monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies have an uncomplicated course, but some develop severe complications including selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), twintwin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). The underlying pathogenesis of these various complications is associated with the ubiquitous presence of vascular anastomoses in MC placentas. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence, number, size and localization of the anastomoses in sIUGR, TTTS and TAPS placentas compared to normal MC placentas using color dye injection. We excluded MC twin pregnancies treated with fetoscopic laser surgery or selective feticide. A total of 235 placentas fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 126 normal MC, 47 TTTS, 46 sIUGR and 16 spontaneous TAPS. Median number of anastomoses in normal MC, sIUGR, TTTS and TAPS placentas was 8 (IQR: 4-12), 8 (IQR: 5-14), 7 (IQR: 5-11) and 4 (IQR: 3-5), respectively. The prevalence of arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses in normal MC, sIUGR, TTTS and TAPS placentas was 96%, 98%, 47% and 19%, respectively. We found AV anastomoses to be evenly distributed along the vascular equator in all MC placentas except in TAPS cases, where anastomoses were mostly localized near the margin. We also found that, in sIUGR and TTTS placentas, AA anastomoses tended to be at the center of the placenta. The present study shows that the prevalence, size, number and localization of the various types of anastomoses differ between normal MC, sIUGR, TTTS and TAPS placentas. ",0
286,7812083,"Effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, 2-deoxyglucose-induced glucose cytopenia, and hyperglycemia on cardiovascular tone in normal and diabetic rats","We studied the metabolic and cardiovascular responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, 2-deoxyglucose-induced glucose cytopenia, and hyperglycemia in normal rats and in rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes. Insulin (2.0 U/kg) was infused intravenously into normal and 4-week diabetic rats, and the cardiovascular responses were monitored for 90 minutes. Insulin infusion decreased plasma glucose and mean arterial pressure by the same relative degree in both groups of animals. Heart rate was significantly decreased only in the diabetic rats. The injection of 2-deoxyglucose was followed by an increase in plasma glucose in both normal and diabetic rats. Heart rate was increased in normal rats, and both mean arterial pressure and heart rate decreased in the diabetic animals. Hyperglycemia induced by infusion of glucose increased plasma glucose and insulin and decreased mean arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups of animals. We concluded that acute insulin or insulin-induced hypoglycemia decreases cardiovascular tone in normals and, to a significantly greater extent, in diabetic rats and that while 2-deoxyglucose-induced glucose cytopenia increases cardiovascular tone in normal rats, it elicits a hypotensive response in diabetic ones. Glucose-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular tone in both groups of animals. ",0
287,7489972,Increased production of nitric oxide by neutrophils and monocytes from cirrhotic patients with ascites and hyperdynamic circulation,"An increased release of nitric oxide (NO), a powerful vasodilating agent, has been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of vasodilation and hyperdynamic circulation associated with advanced cirrhosis. We evaluated NO synthase (NOS) activity in peripheral leukocytes of 12 cirrhotic patients and 9 healthy subjects together with plasma endotoxin levels and systemic hemodynamic (by a noninvasive echocardiographic method). NOS activity was evaluated by (1) measuring the capacity of isolated polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes to convert [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline; (2) measuring the ability of neutrophils and monocytes to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and to increase guanosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate content in coincubated platelets, an expression of NO release from these cells. Both neutrophils and monocytes from cirrhotic patients produced significantly higher amounts of [3H]citrulline than cells obtained from healthy subjects (P < .001 and P < .02 for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively) and were more effective than control cells in inhibiting platelet aggregation (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively for 2 x 10(6) cells) and in increasing guanosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate content in coincubated platelets (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively). The anti-aggregating activity expressed by leukocytes has a pharmacological profile similar to that described for NO, because it increased after addition of superoxide dismutase, a superoxide anion scavenger, and markedly decreased after inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). Cirrhotic patients had significantly higher plasma endotoxin levels (P < .001) and cardiac index (P < .01) when compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
288,29781627,"Triple trajectories of alcohol use, tobacco use, and depressive symptoms as predictors of cannabis use disorders among urban adults","Heavy cannabis use is associated with a wide array of physical, mental, and functional problems. Therefore, cannabis use disorders (CUDs) may be a major public health concern. Given the adverse health consequences of CUDs, the present study seeks to find possible precursors of CUDs. The current study consisted of 5 waves of data collection from the Harlem Longitudinal Development Study. Among 816 participants, about half are African Americans (52%), and the other half are Puerto Ricans (48%). We used Mplus to obtain the triple trajectories of alcohol use, tobacco use, and depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to examine the associations between the trajectory groups and CUDs. The 5 trajectory groups were (1) moderate alcohol use, high tobacco use, and high depressive symptoms (MHH; 12%); (2) moderate alcohol use, high tobacco use, and low depressive symptoms (MHL; 26%); (3) moderate alcohol use, low tobacco use, and low depressive symptoms (MLL; 18%); (4) low alcohol use, no tobacco use, and high depressive symptoms (LNH; 11%); and (5) low alcohol use, no tobacco use, and low depressive symptoms (LNL; 33%). The MHH, MHL, MLL, and LNH trajectory groups were associated with an increased likelihood of having CUDs compared to the LNL trajectory group after controlling for a number of confounding factors (e.g., CUDs in the late 20s). The findings of the current longitudinal study suggest that treatments designed to reduce or quit drinking as well as smoking and to relieve depressive symptoms may reduce the prevalence of CUDs.

METHOD: Patients (8 to 19 years old) who had improved during an 8-week, randomized, double-blind acute trial of olanzapine, risperidone, or molindone (plus benztropine) were eligible to continue on the same medication for up to 44 additional weeks under double-blind conditions. Adjunctive medications were allowed according to defined algorithms. Standardized symptom, safety, and functional assessments were conducted every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 116 youths randomized in the acute trial, 54 entered maintenance treatment (molindone, n = 20; olanzapine, n = 13; risperidone, n = 21). Fourteen (26%) completed 44 weeks of treatment. Adverse effects (n = 15), inadequate efficacy (n = 14), or study nonadherence (n = 8) were the most common reasons for discontinuation. The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Only 12% of youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders continued on their originally randomized treatment at 52 weeks. No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain. Improved treatments are needed for early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

292,27959697,Resolution of Disease Phenotypes Resulting from Multilocus Genomic Variation,"BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing can provide insight into the relationship between observed clinical phenotypes and underlying genotypes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a series of 7374 consecutive unrelated patients who had been referred to a clinical diagnostic laboratory for whole-exome sequencing; our goal was to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients for whom more than one molecular diagnosis was reported. The phenotypic similarity between molecularly diagnosed pairs of diseases was calculated with the use of terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology. RESULTS: A molecular diagnosis was rendered for 2076 of 7374 patients (28.2%); among these patients, 101 (4.9%) had diagnoses that involved two or more disease loci. We also analyzed parental samples, when available, and found that de novo variants accounted for 67.8% (61 of 90) of pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant disease genes and 51.7% (15 of 29) of pathogenic variants in X-linked disease genes; both variants were de novo in 44.7% (17 of 38) of patients with two monoallelic variants. Causal copy-number variants were found in 12 patients (11.9%) with multiple diagnoses. Phenotypic similarity scores were significantly lower among patients in whom the phenotype resulted from two distinct mendelian disorders that affected different organ systems (50 patients) than among patients with disorders that had overlapping phenotypic features (30 patients) (median score, 0.21 vs. 0.36; P=1.77�10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found multiple molecular diagnoses in 4.9% of cases in which whole-exome sequencing was informative. Our results show that structured clinical ontologies can be used to determine the degree of overlap between two mendelian diseases in the same patient; the diseases can be distinct or overlapping. Distinct disease phenotypes affect different organ systems, whereas overlapping disease phenotypes are more likely to be caused by two genes encoding proteins that interact within the same pathway.

296,11281569,Hepatitis after intravenous buprenorphine misuse in heroin addicts,"BACKGROUND: Sublingual buprenorphine is used as a substitution drug in heroin addicts. Although buprenorphine inhibits mitochondrial function at high concentrations in experimental animals, these effects should not occur after therapeutic sublingual doses, which give very low plasma concentrations. CASE REPORTS: We report four cases of former heroin addicts infected with hepatitis C virus and placed on substitution therapy with buprenorphine. These patients exhibited a marked increase in serum alanine amino transferase (30-, 37-, 13- and 50-times the upper limit of normal, respectively) after injecting buprenorphine intravenously and three of them also became jaundiced. Interruption of buprenorphine injections was associated with prompt recovery, even though two of these patients continued buprenorphine by the sublingual route. A fifth patient carrying the hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses, developed jaundice and asterixis with panlobular liver necrosis and microvesicular steatosis after using sublingual buprenorphine and small doses of paracetamol and aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: Although buprenorphine hepatitis is most uncommon even after intravenous misuse, addicts placed on buprenorphine substitution should be repeatedly warned not to use it intravenously. Higher drug concentrations could trigger hepatitis in a few intravenous users, possibly those whose mitochondrial function is already impaired by viral infections and other factors.",1

Mutations of the LIPA gene lead to Wolman disease (WD) and cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). The disease hallmarks include hepatosplenomegaly and extensive storage of CE and/or TG. The effects of intravenous investigational enzyme therapy (ET) on survival and efficacy were evaluated in Lipa knock out, lal-/- mice with advanced disease using recombinant human LAL (rhLAL). Comparative ET was conducted with lower doses (weekly, 0.8 and 3.2mg/kg) beginning at 16 weeks (study 1), and with higher dose (10mg/kg) in early (8-weeks), middle (16-weeks) and late (24-weeks) disease stages (study 2). In study 1, rhLAL extended the life span of lal-/- mice in a dose dependent manner by 52 (0.8 mg/kg) or 94 (3.2mg/kg) days. This was accompanied by partial correction of cholesterol and TG levels in spleen and liver. In study 2, the high dose resulted in a significant improvement in organ size (liver, spleen and small intestine) and tissue histology as well as significant decreases in cholesterol and TG in all three groups. In the treated livers and spleens the cholesterol and TG levels were reduced to below treatment initiation levels indicating a reversal of disease manifestations, even in advanced disease. ET diminished liver fibrosis and macrophage proliferation.

301,22541332,Recent advances in the genetics and immunology of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN) are rare but life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which are majorly (65-75%) induced by a variety of drugs. SJS/TEN could be recognized as SCARs or drug immune reactions, if the reactions are elicited by drugs. The recent studies suggested that SJS/TEN is a specific immune reaction initiated by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) via human leukocyte antigens (HLAs)-restricted pathway. The patho-mechanism involving HLA-restricted presentation of a drug or its metabolites for T-cell activation is supported by the findings of strong genetic associations with HLA alleles (e.g. HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine-SJS/TEN, and HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol-SJS/TEN). However, the genetic associations of SJS/TEN or drug induced cutaneous immune reactions are complex, which are drug specific and ethnicity specific. The genetic polymorphisms and diversity of HLA alleles may provide different binding affinities for drug antigens to launch the activation of specific CTLs responses, further leading to the unique clinical manifestations in SJS/TEN. Fas-FasL and perforin/granzyme B have been advocated mediating the epidermal necrosis in SJS/TEN. Our recent study showed that granulysin, a cytotoxic protein produced by CTLs or natural killer (NK) cells, is the key mediator for disseminated keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. From the point of view of a physician, the profounder understanding of the genetic predisposition and patho-mechanism we discover, the better strategies for prevention, clinical management, and therapeutic methods of SJS/TEN we can develop in the near future.",1

TNF-alpha activity is mediated through TNFRI and TNFRII cell surface receptors, which act as physiological attenuators of TNF-alpha activity. We recruited 190 RA patients and 190 healthy subjects (HS) in order to associate the -383A>C TNFRI polymorphism with sTNFRI levels and DAS28 score in RA. In results, sTNFRI levels were higher in RA patients than HS (P = 0.04). The -383A>C TNFRI polymorphism did not show significant differences in both studied groups. However, in the RA group the sTNFRI levels were significantly elevated (P = 0.004) in A/A genotype carriers. In addition, the A/A genotype carriers had the higher DAS28 score than A/C genotype (P = 0.02). These data suggest that -383A>C TNFRI polymorphism is not a susceptibility marker in RA, whereas the increased levels of sTNFRI could reflect the clinical activity in RA patients. ",0
303,24330551,Matrix forming characteristics of inner and outer human meniscus cells on 3D collagen scaffolds under normal and low oxygen tensions,"Limited intrinsic healing potential of the meniscus and a strong correlation between meniscal injury and osteoarthritis have prompted investigation of surgical repair options, including the implantation of functional bioengineered constructs. Cell-based constructs appear promising, however the generation of meniscal constructs is complicated by the presence of diverse cell populations within this heterogeneous tissue and gaps in the information concerning their response to manipulation of oxygen tension during cell culture. Four human lateral menisci were harvested from patients undergoing total knee replacement. Inner and outer meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) were expanded to passage 3 in growth medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), then embedded in porous collagen type I scaffolds and chondrogenically stimulated with transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3) under 21% (normal or normoxic) or 3% (hypoxic) oxygen tension for 21 days. Following scaffold culture, constructs were analyzed biochemically for glycosaminoglycan production, histologically for deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as at the molecular level for expression of characteristic mRNA transcripts. Constructs cultured under normal oxygen tension expressed higher levels of collagen type II (p = 0.05), aggrecan (p < 0.05) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, (COMP) (p < 0.05) compared to hypoxic expanded and cultured constructs. Accumulation of ECM rich in collagen type II and sulfated proteoglycan was evident in normoxic cultured scaffolds compared to those under low oxygen tension. There was no significant difference in expression of these genes between scaffolds seeded with MFCs isolated from inner or outer regions of the tissue following 21 days chondrogenic stimulation (p > 0.05). Cells isolated from inner and outer regions of the human meniscus demonstrated equivalent differentiation potential toward chondrogenic phenotype and ECM production. Oxygen tension played a key role in modulating the redifferentiation of meniscal fibrochondrocytes on a 3D collagen scaffold in vitro. ",0

RESULTS: In phase 1, the charts of 11 patients with anaphylactoid reactions (9 cutaneous and 2 systemic) were reviewed. In most cases, no treatment or treatment with diphenhydramine alone or with salbutamol was sufficient to continue or restart NAC infusion safely. On the basis of our findings in those patients and on published experience, we concluded that anaphylactoid reactions to intravenous NAC are dose-related and the antihistamines are useful in controlling and in preventing recurrence of anaphylactoid symptoms. We developed the following guidelines: flushing requires no treatment, urticaria should be treated with diphenhydramine, and NAC infusion should be continued in both cases. Angioedema and respiratory symptoms each require the administration of diphenhydramine and symptomatic therapy. In these cases, NAC infusion should be stopped but, when necessary, can be started 1 hour after the administration of diphenhydramine in the absence of symptoms. In phase 2, 50 patients (31 cutaneous and 19 systemic reactions) were treated prospectively with the use of these guidelines. Recurrence of symptoms occurred in only one case involving a deviation from the guidelines. The NAC infusion was restarted immediately after the administration of diphenhydramine in a patient who sustained a systemic reaction. CONCLUSION: Non-life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions to intravenous NAC are treated easily and the infusion may be continued or restarted safely after the administration of diphenhydramine.",1

Breaking the cycle of tissue inflammation, infection, and sepsis, resulting from leakage of enteric contents, should be a major goal in the approach to these complex patients. We describe a technique utilizing vacuum assisted closure (VAC) which achieves control of enteric flow from fistulae in open abdominal wounds. The fistula-VAC is fashioned from standard sponge supplies, negative pressure pumps, and ostomy appliances. The fistula-VAC was changed every three days prior to split thickness skin grafting, and every five days following grafting. Five patients underwent application of the fistula-VAC. All patients had complete diversion of enteric contents. This enteric diversion allowed for successful skin grafting in all patients. Application of the fistula-VAC should be considered a useful option in treating patients with intestinal fistulae in open abdominal wounds. ",0
310,26789873,Clinical Practice. Postmenopausal Osteoporosis,"""Key Clinical Points Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.""",1
311,3045557,Results and policy implications of the resource-based relative-value study,"""The resource-based relative-value scale (RBRVS) is a measure of relative levels of resource input expended when physicians produce services and procedures. It is a function of the physician's work input, the opportunity cost of specialty training, and the relative practice costs for each specialty. This paper presents resource-based relative values (RBRVs) for selected procedures of four major specialties--family practice, internal medicine, general surgery, and thoracic and cardiovascular surgery. We compare RBRVs with current charges and find several general patterns. Invasive procedures are typically compensated at more than double the rate of evaluation-and-management services, when both consume the same resource inputs. Imaging and laboratory procedures fall between invasive and evaluation-and-management services. We analyze the financial implications of the RBRVS by developing a simple model and simulating the effects of an RBRVS-based fee schedule on physicians' revenues in various specialties. We use Medicare data to perform the simulation under the """"budget-neutral"""" assumption. Results show that an RBRVS-based fee schedule affects specialties differently. The average family practitioner could receive 60 percent more revenue from Medicare, whereas the average ophthalmologist could lose 40 percent of current revenues. The effects on other specialties fall between these two.""",0
312,14500804,The effects of parathyroid hormone and alendronate alone or in combination in postmenopausal osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: Parathyroid hormone increases bone strength primarily by stimulating bone formation, whereas antiresorptive drugs reduce bone resorption. We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical study of parathyroid hormone and alendronate to test the hypothesis that the concurrent administration of the two agents would increase bone density more than the use of either one alone. METHODS: A total of 238 postmenopausal women (who were not using bisphosphonates) with low bone mineral density at the hip or spine (a T score of less than -2.5, or a T score of less than -2.0 with an additional risk factor for osteoporosis) were randomly assigned to daily treatment with parathyroid hormone (1-84) (100 microg; 119 women), alendronate (10 mg; 60 women), or both (59 women) and were followed for 12 months. Bone mineral density at the spine and hip was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography. Markers of bone turnover were measured in fasting blood samples. RESULTS: The bone mineral density at the spine increased in all the treatment groups, and there was no significant difference in the increase between the parathyroid hormone group and the combination-therapy group. The volumetric density of the trabecular bone at the spine increased substantially in all groups, but the increase in the parathyroid hormone group was about twice that found in either of the other groups. Bone formation increased markedly in the parathyroid hormone group but not in the combination-therapy group. Bone resorption decreased in the combination-therapy group and the alendronate group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of synergy between parathyroid hormone and alendronate. Changes in the volumetric density of trabecular bone, the cortical volume at the hip, and levels of markers of bone turnover suggest that the concurrent use of alendronate may reduce the anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone. Longer-term studies of fractures are needed to determine whether and how antiresorptive drugs can be optimally used in conjunction with parathyroid hormone therapy.",0

Fifty-four patients with advanced sarcoma (age 43 yrs, range 18-70), all pretreated with prior chemotherapy, were enrolled on a named individual basis for treatment with trabectedin. Diagnosis was adult soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in 46 patients, Ewing's family tumour (EFT) in 4, and osteosarcoma (OS) in 4. The initial 23 patients (total number of courses administered: 68) did not receive premedication prior to trabectedin, while the other 31 patients (total number of courses administered: 134) received premedication with dexamethasone 4 mg po bid 24 hours before therapy. Incidence of toxicity (grade 3-4), expressed as percentage of courses, was as follows: in patients without dexamethasone, elevation of transaminases 34%, neutropenia 24% and thrombocytopenia 25%; in patients with prior dexamethasone, elevation of transaminases 2%, neutropenia 2% and no thrombocytopenia. The median received dose intensity of trabectedin was superimposable in the two groups (404 microg and 400 microg per week, respectively), as well as progression-free survival (19% at 6 months). Among STS patients, 9% had objective responses. In this unselected patient series, premedication with dexamethasone strongly reduced drug-induced hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression.""",1

315,17377159,NALP1 in vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune disease,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases involve interactions between genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. We searched for a gene on chromosome 17p13 that contributes to a group of epidemiologically associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. The group includes various combinations of generalized vitiligo, autoimmune thyroid disease, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Addison's disease. METHODS: We tested 177 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the 17p13 linkage peak for association with disease and identified a strong candidate gene. We then sequenced DNA in and around the gene to identify additional SNPs. We carried out a second round of tests of association using some of these additional SNPs, thus elucidating the association with disease in the gene and its extended promoter region in fine detail. RESULTS: Association analyses resulted in our identifying as a candidate gene NALP1, which encodes NACHT leucine-rich-repeat protein 1, a regulator of the innate immune system. Fine-scale association mapping with the use of DNA from affected families and additional SNPs in and around NALP1 showed an association of specific variants with vitiligo alone, with an extended autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease phenotype, or with both. Conditional logistic-regression analysis of NALP1 SNPs indicated that at least two variants contribute independently to the risk of disease. CONCLUSIONS: DNA sequence variants in the NALP1 region are associated with the risk of several epidemiologically associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, implicating the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of these disorders.",0

317,1767833,Contribution of adrenergic mechanisms to glucose counterregulation in humans,"To assess the role of adrenergic mechanisms during prolonged hypoglycemia, eight normal subjects were studied on six occasions. In study 1, insulin was infused subcutaneously (15 mU.m-2.min-1 for 12 h), and plasma glucose concentration (PG) decreased from 89 +/- 2 to 50 +/- 1 mg/dl. In study 2 (insulin as in study 1 + propranolol and phentolamine + variable glucose to maintain PG as in study 1), the rate of hepatic glucose production (HGO, [3-3H]glucose) was approximately 30% lower after 1.5 h, and the rate of peripheral glucose utilization (GU) was approximately 15% greater after 5 h. To quantitate the effects of adrenergic mechanisms on glucose counterregulation, in a control study (study 3), glucoregulatory hormone secretion was blocked, and the hormones were reinfused to reproduce study 1. When alpha- and beta-blockade plus variable glucose were superimposed to study 3 (study 4), HGO was approximately 25% lower (after 2 h), and GU was approximately 10% greater (after 6 h) vs. study 3. When glucose was not infused to match PG of study 3 (study 5), severe hypoglycemia developed (PG at 7 h 36 +/- 2 vs. 62 +/- 3 mg/dl). Finally, when glucose was not infused during alpha- and beta-blockade of study 2 (study 6), PG was 49 +/- 3 mg/dl at 7 h vs. 65 +/- 3 mg/dl of the control study (study 1), despite greater secretion of glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol. It is concluded that adrenergic mechanisms play a key counterregulatory role, even in the presence of appropriate responses of glucagon and that greater increases in glucagon (and other counterregulatory hormones) cannot compensate fully for absent contribution of adrenergic mechanisms to counterregulation.

318,24986866,Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells suppress host rejection: the role of the glycocalyx,"Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have unique immunosuppressive properties enabling them to evade host rejection and making them valuable tools for cell therapy. We previously showed that human UMSCs survive xenograft transplantation and successfully correct the corneal clouding defects associated with the mouse model for the congenital metabolic disorder mucopolysaccharidosis VII. However, the precise mechanism by which UMSCs suppress the immune system remains elusive. This study aimed to determine the key components involved in the ability of the UMSCs to modulate the inflammatory system and to identify the inflammatory cells that are regulated by the UMSCs. Our results show that human UMSCs transplanted into the mouse stroma 24 h after an alkali burn suppress the severe inflammatory response and enable the recovery of corneal transparency within 2 weeks. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vitro that UMSCs inhibit the adhesion and invasion of inflammatory cells and also the polarization of M1 macrophages. UMSCs also induced the maturation of T-regulatory cells and led to inflammatory cell death. Moreover, UMSCs exposed to inflammatory cells synthesize a rich extracellular glycocalyx composed of the chondroitin sulfate-proteoglycan versican bound to a heavy chain (HC)-modified hyaluronan (HA) matrix (HC-HA). This matrix also contains TNFα-stimulated gene 6 (TSG6), the enzyme that transfers HCs to HA, and pentraxin-3, which further stabilizes the matrix. Our results, both in vivo and in vitro, show that this glycocalyx confers the ability for UMSCs to survive the host immune system and to regulate the inflammatory cells.  ",0

321,7494564,Blood pressure and end-stage renal disease in men,"BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease in the United States creates a large burden for both individuals and society as a whole. Efforts to prevent the condition require an understanding of modifiable risk factors. METHODS: We assessed the development of end-stage renal disease through 1990 in 332,544 men, 35 to 57 years of age, who were screened between 1973 and 1975 for entry into the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT). We used data from the national registry for treated end-stage renal disease of the Health Care Financing Administration and from records on death from renal disease from the National Death Index and the Social Security Administration. RESULTS: During an average of 16 years of follow-up, 814 subjects either died of end-stage renal disease or were treated for that condition (15.6 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation). A strong, graded relation between both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and end-stage renal disease was identified, independent of associations between the disease and age, race, income, use of medication for diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, serum cholesterol concentration, and cigarette smoking. As compared with men with an optimal level of blood pressure (systolic pressure < 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure < 80 mm Hg), the relative risk of end-stage renal disease for those with stage 4 hypertension (systolic pressure > or = 210 mm Hg or diastolic pressure > or = 120 mm Hg) was 22.1 (P < 0.001). These relations were not due to end-stage renal disease that occurred soon after screening and, in the 12,866 screened men who entered the MRFIT study, were not changed by taking into account the base-line serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion. The estimated risk of end-stage renal disease associated with elevations of systolic pressure was greater than that linked with elevations of diastolic pressure when both variables were considered together. CONCLUSIONS: Elevations of blood pressure are a strong independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease; interventions to prevent the disease need to emphasize the prevention and control of both high-normal and high blood pressure.",0

323,25580226,The ACCE method: an approach for obtaining quantitative or qualitative estimates of residual confounding,"""  Nonrandomized studies typically cannot account for confounding from unmeasured factors.    A method is presented that exploits the recently-identified phenomenon of  """"confounding amplification"""" to produce, in principle, a quantitative estimate of total residual confounding resulting from both measured and unmeasured factors.  Two nested propensity score models are constructed that differ only in the deliberate introduction of an additional variable(s) that substantially predicts treatment exposure.  Residual confounding is then estimated by dividing the change in treatment effect estimate between models by the degree of confounding amplification estimated to occur, adjusting for any association between the additional variable(s) and outcome.   A hypothetical example is provided to illustrate how the method produces a quantitative estimate of residual confounding if the method's requirements and assumptions are met.  Previously published data is used to illustrate that, whether or not the method routinely provides precise quantitative estimates of residual confounding, the method appears to produce a valuable qualitative estimate of the likely direction and general size of residual confounding.   Uncertainties exist, including identifying the best approaches for: 1) predicting the amount of confounding amplification, 2) minimizing changes between the nested models unrelated to confounding amplification, 3) assessing the association of the introduced variable(s) with outcome, and 4) deriving confidence intervals for the method's estimates (although bootstrapping is one plausible approach).   To this author's knowledge, it has not been previously suggested that the phenomenon of confounding amplification, if such amplification is as predictable as suggested by a recent simulation, provides a logical basis for estimating total residual confounding. The method's basic approach is straightforward.  The method's routine usefulness, however, has not yet been established, nor has the method been fully validated. Rapid further investigation of this novel method is clearly indicated, given the potential value of its quantitative or qualitative output. """,0
324,10376242,Changes in plasma and milk concentrations of glucose and IGF-1 in response to exogenous growth hormone in lactating goats,"Exogenous growth hormone was administered subcutaneously to five lactating goats during the post-peak period of lactation. Milk yields increased significantly by approximately 20% in response to growth hormone. Blood and milk samples were taken in the periods before, during and after growth hormone treatment. The concentrations of glucose in milk increased significantly by approximately 50% in the period following growth hormone treatment at a time corresponding to the increase in milk yield. There was a transient increase in plasma glucose concentrations immediately following growth hormone treatment before either milk glucose concentrations or milk yields were increased. Both free and total IGF-1 concentrations in plasma increased slowly following growth hormone treatment. The increase in plasma IGF-1 corresponded to the increase in milk yields and milk glucose concentrations. Concentrations of IGF-1 in milk increased more rapidly than those in plasma, rising by approximately 150% following growth hormone treatment, and were starting to decline by the time that milk yield and milk glucose concentrations were at their maximum. As milk glucose concentrations have been shown previously to reflect changes in the intracellular concentration of glucose, the results indicate that part of the mechanism by which growth hormone stimulates milk production is by increasing the intracellular availability of glucose for lactose synthesis. The results also suggest that changes occur in the concentrations of IGF-1 in the environment of the mammary gland before changes are observed in the general circulation, and that these are reflected in the changed concentrations in milk.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of PPARγ, DNMT1, and DNMT3B and their correlation with clinical-pathological features in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC), and to define the effect of PPARγ activation on DNMTs expression in PC cell lines. qRT-PCR analysis showed that DNMT3B expression was downregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues (P = 0.03), whereas PPARγ and DNMT1 levels did not show significant alterations in PC patients. Expression levels between PPARγ and DNMT1 and between DNMT1 and DNMT3B were highly correlated (P = 0.008 and P = 0.05 resp.). DNMT3B overexpression in tumor tissue was positively correlated with both lymph nodes spreading (P = 0.046) and resection margin status (P = 0.04), and a borderline association with perineural invasion (P = 0.06) was found. Furthermore, high levels of DNMT3B expression were significantly associated with a lower mortality in the whole population (HR = 0.485; 95%CI = 0.262-0.895, P = 0.02) and in the subgroup of patients without perineural invasion (HR = 0.314; 95%CI = 0.130-0.758; P = 0.01), while such association was not observed in patients with tumor invasion into perineural structures (P = 0.70). In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo PPARγ and DNMTs appear interrelated in PC, and this interaction might influence cell phenotype and disease behavior. ",0
326,23636618,Effects of acute and chronic administration of fenproporex on DNA damage parameters in young and adult rats,"Obesity is a chronic and multifactorial disease, whose prevalence is increasing in many countries. Pharmaceutical strategies for the treatment of obesity include drugs that regulate food intake, thermogenesis, fat absorption, and fat metabolism. Fenproporex is the second most commonly consumed amphetamine-based anorectic worldwide; this drug is rapidly converted in vivo into amphetamine, which is associated with neurotoxicity. In this context, the present study evaluated DNA damage parameters in the peripheral blood of young and adult rats submitted to an acute administration and chronic administration of fenproporex. In the acute administration, both young and adult rats received a single injection of fenproporex (6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle. In the chronic administration, both young and adult rats received one daily injection of fenproporex (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg i.p.) or Tween for 14 days. 2 h after the last injection, the rats were killed by decapitation and their peripheral blood removed for evaluation of DNA damage parameters by alkaline comet assay. Our study showed that acute administration of fenproporex in young and adult rats presented higher levels of damage index and frequency in the DNA. However, chronic administration of fenproporex in young and adult rats did not alter the levels of DNA damage in both parameters of comet assay. The present findings showed that acute administration of fenproporex promoted damage in DNA, in both young and adult rats. Our results are consistent with other reports which showed that other amphetamine-derived drugs also caused DNA damage. We suggest that the activation of an efficient DNA repair mechanism may occur after chronic exposition to fenproporex. Our results are consistent with other reports that showed some amphetamine-derived drugs also caused DNA damage. ",0
327,7643881,"Race, sex, drug use, and progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease","BACKGROUND: The rates of progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and survival have been reported to differ among sociodemographic groups. It is unclear whether these differences reflect biologic differences or differences in access to medical care. METHODS: We measured disease progression and survival in a cohort of 1372 patients seropositive for HIV who were treated at a single urban center (median follow-up, 1.6 years). We calculated the rates of survival for the entire cohort and the rates of progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death among the 740 patients who presented without AIDS. We used Cox proportional-hazards analysis to examine factors associated with progression to AIDS and death. RESULTS: Progression to AIDS or death was associated with a CD4 cell count of 201 to 350 per cubic millimeter (relative risk, 2.0; P < 0.001), the presence of symptoms at base line (relative risk, 2.0; P < 0.001), prior antiretroviral therapy (relative risk, 1.7; P = 0.003), and older age (relative risk per year of age, 1.02; P = 0.03). However, there was no relation between disease progression and sex, race, injection-drug use, income, level of education, or insurance status. In the entire cohort, a lower CD4 cell count, a diagnosis of AIDS, older age, and the receipt of antiretroviral therapy before enrollment were associated with an increased risk of death, whereas the use of prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia, zidovudine use after enrollment, and having a job at base line were associated with lower risks of death. There was no significant difference in survival between men and women, blacks and whites, injection-drug users and those who did not use drugs, or patients whose median annual incomes were $5,000 or less and those whose incomes were more than $5,000. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HIV infection who received medical care from a single urban center, there were no differences in disease progression or survival associated with sex, race, injection-drug use, or socioeconomic status. Differences found in other studies may reflect differences in the use of medical care.",0

330,19279342,Growth in the care of older patients by hospitalists in the United States,"BACKGROUND: National and population-based information on the increase in patient care by hospitalists in the United States is lacking. METHODS: Using a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 1995, 1997, 1999, and the period from 2001 through 2006, we identified 120,226 physicians in general internal medicine who were providing care to older patients in 5800 U.S. hospitals. We defined hospitalists as general internists who derived 90% or more of their Medicare claims for evaluation-and-management services from the care of hospitalized patients. We then calculated the percentage of all inpatient Medicare services provided by hospitalists and identified patient and hospital characteristics associated with the receipt of hospitalist services. RESULTS: The percentage of physicians in general internal medicine who were identified as hospitalists increased from 5.9% in 1995 to 19.0% in 2006, and the percentage of all claims for inpatient evaluation-and-management services by general internists that were attributed to hospitalists increased from 9.1% to 37.1% during this same period. Accompanying the increase in care by hospitalists was an increase in the percentage of all hospitalized Medicare patients who were treated by general internists (both hospitalists and traditional, non-hospital-based general internists), from 46.4% in 1995 to 61.0% in 2006. In a multilevel, multivariable analysis controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, the odds of receiving care from a hospitalist increased by 29.2% per year from 1997 through 2006. In 2006, there was marked geographic variation in the rates of care provided by hospitalists, with rates of more than 70% in some hospital-referral regions. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses of data from Medicare claims showed a substantial increase in the care of hospitalized patients by hospitalist physicians from 1995 to 2006.",0

An in vitro yeast two-hybrid assay indicated a significant, dose-dependent interaction between medaka estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and coactivator TIF2 upon treatment with 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH or 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10-nonadecafluoro-1-decanol (NFDH). The relative ranks of tested chemicals on the estrogenic effects for medaka ERalpha descended in the order of estradiol-17beta (100)>>6:2 FTOH (0.16)>NFDH (0.016)>8:2 FTOH (0.0044). In contrast, no interaction with the ERalpha was observed upon treatment with perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDA) or perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Expression analysis of hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) protein showed estrogenic potentials with, 6:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH, indicative of the induction of VTG synthesis in the livers of male medaka. We also investigated mRNA expression levels of two ER subtypes (ERalpha and beta) and two VTGs (VTG I and VTG II) in the livers of male medaka following exposure to FTOHs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that hepatic ERalpha, VTG I, and VTG II mRNA responded rapidly to FTOHs such as 6:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH after 8-h exposure, whereas no effects of these compounds on ERbeta mRNA transcription were observed. These results from both in vitro and in vivo assays strongly suggest that certain FTOHs, such as 6:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH, induce hepatic VTG through activation of ERalpha in male medaka. ",0

In non-comparative trials, arthralgia and myalgia were reported most frequently but were reversible upon treatment discontinuation. The renal, inner ear, cardiovascular and central nervous systems were not implicated as significant target organs for toxicity. The most frequent local adverse events related to infusion of quinupristin/dalfopristin were inflammation, pain, oedema, infusion site reaction and thrombophlebitis. Results of laboratory tests while on therapy were comparable for quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator groups, except that increases in conjugated bilirubin of >5 x the upper limit of normal were reported in 5.5% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients; increases in total bilirubin of >5 x the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.5%. Comparator recipients more frequently had increases in alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of drugs including midazolam, nifedipine, terfenadine and cyclosporin. Therefore, plasma drug monitoring and/or dosage reduction of these agents is prudent. Concomitant administration of drugs that can prolong the electrocardiographic QTc interval should be avoided. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is visually and chemically compatible with commonly used drugs of various classes, but it is not compatible with sodium chloride solution and certain other drugs, including some antimicrobials. Therefore, when prescribing quinupristin/dalfopristin, clinicians should be aware of the potential for peripheral venous intolerance, arthralgias and myalgias, increases in conjugated bilirubin, interactions with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and certain physico-chemical incompatibilities. However, multiple studies have shown that the safety and tolerability of quinupristin/dalfopristin are generally favourable, and that it provides clear benefits to ill patients with severe gram-positive infections.""",1
333,18338577,Construction of the gene drb0099 deleted mutant and adversity analysis in the extremely radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans],"Deinococcus radiodurans R1 has extraordinary resistance to radiation. DRB0099 might play an important role in protecting the bacterium against radiation. To verify the inference, we deleted drb0099 and constructed the mutant. Comparing with the wild type, the mutant grew more slowly in the beginning cultivation stage (0-16 h) under normal conditions. After being cultivated for 16 h, the mutant grew faster than the wild type. The biomass concentration of the wild type was always higher than that of the mutant. The mutant cell's fission during the growing phase might be blocked. When treated with UV, although Deinococcus radiodurans R1 cultures' survival fraction was lower with UV treatment time increased, the survival fraction was much higher than that of drb0099. The wild type could repair DNA double strands breaks better than the mutant. The gene drb0099 might directly relate with the DNA repair system. The mutant was more sensitive to H202 than the wild type. The wild type could better protect protein and DNA against reactive oxygen species (ROS) or in DNA repair. When treated with low concentration of H2O2, although the survival fraction of both R1 and the mutant decreased, the difference was small. However, with the concentration of H2O2 increased, the difference value increased. The mutant without drb0099 was more easily injured than the wild type with ROS increased. Under UV or H2O2 treatment, DRB0099 could protect protein and DNA from oxidation. ",0

335,2005938,Diagnosis of magnesium-induced diarrhea,"BACKGROUND: There is no specific method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the frequency and clinical importance of diarrhea caused by magnesium are unknown. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea and to apply it to patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS: We measured fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in 19 normal subjects with formed stools (15 collection periods), with non-magnesium-induced diarrhea (36 collection periods), and with diarrhea induced by magnesium hydroxide alone (11 collection periods) or in combination with phenolphthalein (3 collection periods), and in 359 patients with chronic diarrhea. RESULTS: The upper limits of fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in normal subjects were 14.6 mmol per day and 45.2 mmol per liter, respectively. When normal subjects had diarrhea due to the ingestion of magnesium hydroxide alone or in combination with phenolphthalein, fecal magnesium output was always abnormally high. For each millimole increase in fecal magnesium output, fecal weight increased by approximately 7.3 g. The fecal magnesium concentration was very high when magnesium was the only cause of diarrhea but only moderately elevated when diarrhea was induced by magnesium hydroxide plus phenolphthalein. Biochemical and clinical evidence indicated that excessive ingestion of magnesium was an important cause of chronic diarrhea in 15 of the 359 patients with chronic diarrhea (4.2 percent), if not the only cause. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative fecal analysis for soluble magnesium is an accurate method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Some patients with chronic diarrhea ingest excessive amounts of magnesium (in antacids or food supplements), and physicians may fail to discover this before embarking on an expensive and invasive diagnostic evaluation.",0

339,29364767,Thrombectomy for Stroke at 6 to 16 Hours with Selection by Perfusion Imaging,"BACKGROUND: Thrombectomy is currently recommended for eligible patients with stroke who are treated within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded outcome assessment, of thrombectomy in patients 6 to 16 hours after they were last known to be well and who had remaining ischemic brain tissue that was not yet infarcted. Patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion, an initial infarct size of less than 70 ml, and a ratio of the volume of ischemic tissue on perfusion imaging to infarct volume of 1.8 or more were randomly assigned to endovascular therapy (thrombectomy) plus standard medical therapy (endovascular-therapy group) or standard medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group). The primary outcome was the ordinal score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability) at day 90. RESULTS: The trial was conducted at 38 U.S. centers and terminated early for efficacy after 182 patients had undergone randomization (92 to the endovascular-therapy group and 90 to the medical-therapy group). Endovascular therapy plus medical therapy, as compared with medical therapy alone, was associated with a favorable shift in the distribution of functional outcomes on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days (odds ratio, 2.77; P<0.001) and a higher percentage of patients who were functionally independent, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale of 0 to 2 (45% vs. 17%, P<0.001). The 90-day mortality rate was 14% in the endovascular-therapy group and 26% in the medical-therapy group (P=0.05), and there was no significant between-group difference in the frequency of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7% and 4%, respectively; P=0.75) or of serious adverse events (43% and 53%, respectively; P=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke 6 to 16 hours after a patient was last known to be well plus standard medical therapy resulted in better functional outcomes than standard medical therapy alone among patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion and a region of tissue that was ischemic but not yet infarcted.

340,19177570,In vitro-targeted gene identification in patients with hepatitis C using a genome-wide microarray technology,"Iron in association with reactive oxygen species (ROS) is highly toxic, aggravating oxidative stress reactions. Increased iron not only plays an important role in the progression of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) but also in common liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C. The underlying mechanisms of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated iron accumulation, however, are poorly understood. We introduce an in vitro-targeted approach to identify ROS/iron-regulated genes in patients with HCV using a genome-wide DNA microarray. The sensitivity of the 32,231 complementary DNA clone-carrying microarray was approximately 20% as estimated by detecting target genes of the genome-wide transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha. Upon in vitro challenge to iron and oxidative stress, 265 iron-related and 1326 ROS-related genes could be identified in HepG2 cells; 233 significantly regulated genes were found in patients with mild (HCV) or severe (HH) iron deposition. Notably, 17 of the in vitro-selected genes corresponded to the genes identified in patients with HCV or HH. Among them, natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB) was the only iron-regulated gene identified in vitro that was differentially regulated between HCV and HH. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed most of the microarray-identified genes in an even larger group of patients (n = 12). In patients with HCV, these included genes that are associated with RNA processing (MED9/NFAT, NSUN2), proliferation, differentiation, hypoxia, or iron metabolism (ISG20, MIG6, HIG2, CA9, NDRG1), whereas none of the nine known iron-related genes showed significant differences between HCV and HH. CONCLUSION: Although high-density microarray technology is less suitable for routine liver diagnosis, its use in combination with prior in vitro selection is a powerful approach to identify candidate genes relevant for liver disease.",0
341,19228618,Estimation of the warfarin dose with clinical and pharmacogenetic data,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variability among patients plays an important role in determining the dose of warfarin that should be used when oral anticoagulation is initiated, but practical methods of using genetic information have not been evaluated in a diverse and large population. We developed and used an algorithm for estimating the appropriate warfarin dose that is based on both clinical and genetic data from a broad population base. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data from 4043 patients were used to create a dose algorithm that was based on clinical variables only and an algorithm in which genetic information was added to the clinical variables. In a validation cohort of 1009 subjects, we evaluated the potential clinical value of each algorithm by calculating the percentage of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin was within 20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose; we also evaluated other clinically relevant indicators. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, the pharmacogenetic algorithm accurately identified larger proportions of patients who required 21 mg of warfarin or less per week and of those who required 49 mg or more per week to achieve the target international normalized ratio than did the clinical algorithm (49.4% vs. 33.3%, P<0.001, among patients requiring < or = 21 mg per week; and 24.8% vs. 7.2%, P<0.001, among those requiring > or = 49 mg per week). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a pharmacogenetic algorithm for estimating the appropriate initial dose of warfarin produces recommendations that are significantly closer to the required stable therapeutic dose than those derived from a clinical algorithm or a fixed-dose approach. The greatest benefits were observed in the 46.2% of the population that required 21 mg or less of warfarin per week or 49 mg or more per week for therapeutic anticoagulation.",0
342,1624618,Development of dental plaque on the incisor teeth of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis),"Bacterial plaque which had accumulated for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days was cultured from the labial surface of one of the central incisor teeth in 15 monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each sampling area was defined by a metal well contained within a custom-made removable acrylic block. The number (log10) of the total colony forming units (c.f.u.) increased significantly from 3.40 to 6.02 between 0.5 and 28 days. Similarly the number of streptococci increased from 2.80 to 4.79 during the same period, although when expressed as a percentage of the total c.f.u., the proportions decreased from 34.9 per cent at 1 day to 6.9 per cent at 7 days and then remained at that level. The number of micro-aerophilic actinomyces increased throughout the period of plaque accumulation and comprised 15.3 per cent of the total c.f.u. at 28 days. Neisseriae were infrequently isolated from 0.5- and 1-day-old plaque and were not recovered at more than 1 per cent of the total c.f.u. during any period of plaque accumulation. The fastest doubling time (median) of the total c.f.u. was 1.9 h (range 1.3-18.5 h). The rapid development of dental plaque after tooth cleaning emphasizes the importance of regular and meticulous oral hygiene to control the accumulation of potentially periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.

343,1674589,A phase I evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients with early human immunodeficiency virus infection. Military Medical Consortium for Applied Retroviral Research,"BACKGROUND: Despite multiple antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in a progressively debilitating disease. We hypothesized that a more effective immune response could be generated by post-infection vaccination with HIV-specific antigens. METHODS: We performed a phase I trial of the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine prepared from molecularly cloned envelope protein, gp160, in 30 volunteer subjects with HIV infection in Walter Reed stage 1 or 2. The vaccine was administered either on days 0, 30, and 120 or on days 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, and 180. HIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were measured; local and systemic reactions to vaccination, including general measures of immune function, were monitored. RESULTS: In 19 of the 30 subjects both humoral and cellular immunity to HIV envelope proteins increased in response to vaccination with gp160. Seroconversion to selected envelope epitopes was observed, as were new T-cell proliferative responses to gp160. Response was associated with the CD4 cell count determined before vaccination (13 of 16 subjects [81 percent] with greater than 600 cells per milliliter responded, as compared with 6 of 14 [43 percent] with less than or equal to 600 cells per milliliter; P = 0.07) and with the number of injections administered (87 percent of subjects randomly assigned to receive six injections responded, as compared with 40 percent of those assigned to three injections; P = 0.02). Local reactions at the site of injection were mild. There were no adverse systemic reactions, including diminution of general in vitro or in vivo cellular immune function. After 10 months of follow-up, the mean CD4 count had not decreased in the 19 subjects who responded, but it had decreased by 7.3 percent in the 11 who did not respond. CONCLUSIONS: This gp160 vaccine is safe and immunogenic in volunteer patients with early HIV infection. Although it is too early to know whether this approach will be clinically useful, further scientific and therapeutic evaluation of HIV-specific vaccine therapy is warranted. Similar vaccines may prove to be effective for other chronic infections.",0
344,8139083,A 30-week randomized controlled trial of high-dose tacrine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The Tacrine Study Group,"""OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose tacrine hydrochloride over 30 weeks in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: A 30-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. SETTING: Outpatients at 33 US centers. PATIENTS: Men and women at least 50 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and otherwise in good health. INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 received placebo; group 2 received 40 mg/d of tacrine for 6 weeks, then 80 mg/d for 24 weeks; groups 3 and 4 received 40 mg/d of tacrine for 6 weeks, 80 mg/d for 6 weeks, and 120 mg/d for 6 weeks. Group 3 remained on a dosage of 120 mg/d for a total of 18 weeks; after 6 weeks at 120 mg/d, group 4 titrated to 160 mg/d for the last 12 weeks. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinician Interview-Based Impression (CIBI), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale--Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Final Comprehensive Consensus Assessment (FCCA). RESULTS: A total of 663 patients entered the study; 653 patients were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 263 had evaluable data at 30 weeks. The results of the ITT analysis revealed significant (P < or = .05) dose-response trends and between-group comparisons on CIBI and ADAS-Cog. In evaluable patients, significant dose-response trends were observed for all three primary measures (P < or = .001). Significant differences in favor of 160 mg/d of tacrine vs placebo were observed on the CIBI (P < or = .002) and ADAS-Cog and FCCA (P < or = .001), as well as caregiver-global and quality-of-life assessments (P < or = .05). On the CIBI, 23% and 42% of tacrine-treated patients in the ITT and evaluable-patient populations, respectively, were rated improved compared with 17% and 18% of placebo patients, respectively. The primary reasons for withdrawal of tacrine-treated patients were asymptomatic liver transaminase elevations (28%) and gastrointestinal complaints (16%). These adverse events were reversible on discontinuation of treatment, and many patients were able to restart tacrine. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrine produced statistically significant, dose-related improvements on objective performance-based tests, clinician- and caregiver-rated global evaluations, and measures of quality of life. There was no evidence that the large number of patient withdrawals biased the overall conclusions of the study.""",1

346,16511441,"Deaths associated with hypocalcemia from chelation therapy--Texas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, 2003-2005","Chelating agents bind lead in soft tissues and are used in the treatment of lead poisoning to enhance urinary and biliary excretion of lead, thus decreasing total lead levels in the body. During the past 30 years, environmental and dietary exposures to lead have decreased substantially, resulting in a considerable decrease in population blood lead levels (BLLs) and a corresponding decrease in the number of patients requiring chelation therapy. Chelating agents also increase excretion of other heavy metals and minerals, such as zinc and, in certain cases, calcium. This report describes three deaths associated with chelation-therapy--related hypocalcemia that resulted in cardiac arrest. Several drugs are used in the treatment of lead poisoning, including edetate disodium calcium (CaEDTA), dimercaperol (British anti-Lewisite), D-penicillamine, and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer). Health-care providers who are unfamiliar with chelating agents and are considering this treatment for lead poisoning should consult an expert in the chemotherapy of lead poisoning. Hospital pharmacies should evaluate whether continued stocking of Na2EDTA is necessary, given the established risk for hypocalcemia, the availability of less toxic alternatives, and an ongoing safety review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Health-care providers and pharmacists should ensure that Na2EDTA is not administered to children during chelation therapy.",1

Wistar male rats were fed a high fat diet (30% sheep fat) for 3 months. At an average body weight (BW) of 360g, the rats (n=18) were divided into 3 groups and consumed, for 28 days, either a high fat diet (HFD) or a high fat diet enriched with 1% of whole green algae (WGA) powder or with 1% of its polysaccharides (PLS). In HFD, WGA and PLS supplementation reduced BW and food intake. WGA and PLS compared to HFD reduced systolic (PAS) (-17% and -19%) and diastolic (PAD) blood pressure (-38% and -39%), serum glucose (-37% and -30%, respectively), insulinemia (-55% and -74%, respectively), serum and hepatic total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, as well as the total cholesterol concentration of low and very low density lipoproteins.

However, the use of these markers remains controversial because of the lack of appropriately designed statistical studies. We assessed the hypothesis that Ki-67, cytokeratin 13, or cytokeratin 17 immunohistochemistry could facilitate the diagnosis of oral precancerous lesions and/or predict prognosis. Epithelial dysplasia was classified as low grade (none or mild dysplasia) or high grade (moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ). This study included 58 low-grade and 36 high-grade dysplasia cases. We used logistic regression to assess the diagnostic values of Ki-67, cytokeratin 13, and cytokeratin 17 for high-grade dysplasia. Correlations between these markers and the prognosis of oral atypical epithelium were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Ki-67 overexpression and cytokeratin 13 loss were independent diagnostic markers for high-grade dysplasia (odds ratios, 1.92 and 2.53; 95% confidence intervals, 1.03-3.58, and 1.19-5.38, respectively). The area under the curve of Ki-67 was 0.73 and that of cytokeratin 13 was 0.72. However, the combination of Ki-67 and cytokeratin 13 yielded the area under the curve of 0.78. Ki-67 overexpression was significantly associated with recurrence and/or malignant transformation of oral atypical epithelium (hazard ratio, 7.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-48.92). Ki-67 overexpression and cytokeratin 13 loss may be useful for distinguishing oral precancerous lesions from reactive atypical epithelium. Moreover, Ki-67 overexpression may be a risk factor for recurrence and/or malignant transformation of oral atypical epithelium. ",0

OBJECTIVES: The LOTUS study is a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in Chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=322) were randomized to receive ustekinumab 45 mg or placebo at weeks 0 and 4, with placebo crossover to ustekinumab at week 12; all patients were followed up to week 36. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 12. Other end points at week 12 included the proportion of patients with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 and the change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from baseline. RESULTS: At week 12, 82.5% of ustekinumab-treated patients achieved PASI 75 responses compared with 11.1% of placebo-treated patients (P<.001). Clinical responses were maintained through week 28, with maximum responses observed at week 24.

Oxidative stress can stimulate HSC proliferation and collagen synthesis in vitro. Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) is an effective producer of reactive oxygen species. To study how intracellular oxidative stress modulates alpha 2 collagen type I (COL1A2) gene induction, a rat HSC line (HSC-T6) was transfected with human CYP2E1 complementary DNA in the sense and antisense orientation and with empty vector, and stable cell lines were generated. The cells expressing CYP2E1 displayed elevated production of reactive oxygen species and showed a 4-fold increase in COL1A2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels; expression of this mRNA among different clones appeared to correlate with the level of CYP2E1. COL1A2 expression was decreased by vitamin E treatment or transfection with manganese superoxide dismutase, and was further increased after treatment with L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to lower GSH levels. Thus, CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress plays a major role in the elevation of COL1A2 mRNA levels in this system. Nuclear run-on assay showed a 3-and-a-half-fold increase in COL1A2 transcription in the cells expressing CYP2E1; stabilization of COL1A2 mRNA was also observed. These results indicate that under oxidative stress conditions, COL1A2 mRNA expression is regulated both transcriptionally and through mRNA stabilization. The CYP2E1-expressing HSC appear to be a valuable model for the sustained generation of reactive oxygen species and may allow the elucidation of signaling pathways responsible for oxidant stress-mediated collagen gene induction.""",0

At entry, mean SELENA-SLEDAI scores were 10.5 in the belimumab group and 10.3 in the placebo group. More patients who received belimumab were SRI4 responders than those who received placebo (61.4% versus 48.4%; odds ratio [OR] 1.68 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.25-2.25]; P = 0.0006). In the belimumab group, both time to and risk of severe flare were improved (median 171.0 days versus 118.0 days; hazard ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.35-0.74]; P = 0.0004), and more patients were able to reduce their corticosteroid dosage by >/=25% (to </=7.5 mg/day) during weeks 40-52 (18.2% versus 11.9%; OR 1.65 [95% CI 0.95-2.84]; P = 0.0732), compared with placebo. AE incidence was comparable between treatment groups; serious AEs were reported by 10.8% of patients taking belimumab and 15.7% of those taking placebo. A worsening of IgG hypoglobulinemia by >/=2 grades occurred in 0.9% of patients taking belimumab and 1.4% of those taking placebo. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe SLE, weekly SC doses of belimumab 200 mg plus standard SLE therapy significantly improved their SRI4 response, decreased severe disease flares as compared with placebo, and had a safety profile similar to placebo plus standard SLE therapy.""",1

357,11310525,Possible atypical cross-sensitivity between phenytoin and carbamazepine in the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome,"Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction that occurs in response to common anticonvulsants in predisposed individuals. It is often characterized by fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and laboratory abnormalities. Consequently, it often is overlooked or even misdiagnosed by practitioners unfamiliar with AHS. Cross-sensitivity manifests frequently between phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine as an exacerbation of presenting signs and symptoms. We report a case of AHS in a patient whose clinical features changed significantly when switching from phenytoin to carbamazepine. Physicians and pharmacists must become aware of the extreme variability in AHS manifestation so that the offending anticonvulsant regimen can be discontinued in a timely manner.",1

359,17623837,Phase 2 study of erlotinib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"""BACKGROUND: Growth factor overexpression, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, is common in hepatocellular cancers. Erlotinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with specificity for EGFR. The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with erlotinib who were alive and progression-free (PFS) at 16 weeks of continuous treatment. METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC, no prior systemic therapy, performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2, and Childs-Pugh (CP) cirrhosis A or B received oral erlotinib 150 mg daily for 28-day cycles. Tumor response was assessed every 2 cycles by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Bethesda, Md) criteria. Patients accrued to either """"low"""" or """"high"""" EGFR expression cohorts; each cohort had stopping rules applied when there was a lack of efficacy. RESULTS: Forty HCC patients were enrolled. Median age was 64 years (range, 33-83 years), sex distribution was 32 males and 8 females, performance scores were 40% PS 0, 55% PS 1, Childs-Pugh distribution was 75% A and 20% B. There were no complete or partial responses; however, 17 of 40 patients achieved stable disease at 16 weeks of continuous therapy. The PFS at 16 weeks was 43%, and the median overall survival (OS) was 43 weeks (10.75 months). No patients required dose reductions of erlotinib. No correlation between EGFR expression and outcome was found. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicated that single-agent erlotinib is well tolerated and has modest disease-control benefit in HCC, manifested as modestly prolonged PFS and OS when compared with historical controls.""",1

361,11678619,Arsenic and liver disease,"""The hepatotoxic action of arsenic, when used as a therapeutic agent, has long been recognised. Data on liver involvement following chronic exposure to arsenic-contaminated water are scanty. The nature and degree of liver involvement are reported on the basis of hospital based studies in patients who consumed arsenic contaminated drinking water for one to 15 years. Two hundred forty-eight patients with evidence of chronic arsenic toxicity underwent clinical and laboratory examination including liver function tests and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status. Liver biopsy was done in 69 cases; in 29 patients, liver arsenic content was estimated by neutron activation analysis. Hepatomegaly was present in 190 of 248 patients (76.6%). Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis was the predominant lesion (91.3%) in liver histology. The maximum arsenic content in liver was 6 mg/kg (mean 1.46 [0.42], control value 0.16 [0.04]; p <0.001); it was undetected in 6 of 29 samples studied. The largest number of patients with liver disease due to chronic arsenicosis from drinking arsenic contaminated water are reported. Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis is the predominant lesion in this population. Hepatic fibrosis has also been demonstrated due to long term arsenic toxicity in an animal model. Initial biochemical evidence of hepatic membrane damage, probably due to reduction of glutathione and antioxidant enzymes, may be seen by 6 months. Continued arsenic feeding resulted in fatty liver with serum aminotransferases elevated at 12 months and hepatic fibrosis at 15 months.""",1
362,2041549,"Recovery of motor function after spinal-cord injury--a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with GM-1 ganglioside","BACKGROUND: Spinal-cord injury is devastating; until recently, there was no medical treatment to improve recovery of the initial neurologic deficit. Studies in animals have shown that monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM-1) ganglioside enhances the functional recovery of damaged neurons. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of GM-1 ganglioside was conducted in patients with spinal-cord injuries. Of 37 patients entered into the study, 34 (23 with cervical injuries and 11 with thoracic injuries) completed the test-drug protocol (100 mg of GM-1 sodium salt or placebo intravenously per day for 18 to 32 doses, with the first dose taken within 72 hours of the injury) and a one-year follow-up period. Neurologic recovery was assessed with the Frankel scale (comprising five categories) and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score (a scale of scores from 0 to 100, derived from strength tests of 20 specific muscles, each scored from 0 to 5). RESULTS: There was a significant difference between groups in the distribution of improvement of Frankel grades from base line to the one-year follow-up (improvement of 0, 1, 2, and 3 grades in 13, 4, 1, and 0 patients, respectively, in the placebo group and 8, 1, 6, and 1 patients, respectively, in the GM-1 group; P = 0.034 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). The GM-1-treated patients also had a significantly greater mean improvement in ASIA motor score from base line to the one-year follow-up than the placebo-treated patients (36.9 vs. 21.6 points; P = 0.047 by analysis of covariance with the base-line ASIA motor score as the covariate). An analysis of individual muscle recoveries revealed that the increased recovery in the GM-1 group was attributable to initially paralyzed muscles that regained useful motor strength rather than to strengthening of paretic muscles. CONCLUSIONS: This small study provides evidence that GM-1 enhances the recovery of neurologic function after one year. A larger study must be conducted, however, before GM-1 is considered efficacious and safe in treating spinal-cord injury.",0
363,1972297,Mesalazine: a global safety evaluation,"""The potential benefit of sulphasalazine in inflammatory bowel disease is limited by the wide variety of side effects that occur in about one-third of treated patients. Most of the side effects of sulphasalazine are due to the sulphapyridine moiety. Claversal has the advantage of delivering the active ingredient of sulphasalazine--mesalazine--without the undesirable effects of sulphapyridine. Four international multicentre trials involving 932 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease compared 0.75 g/day or 1.5 g/day mesalazine, 1.5 g/day or 3.0 g/day sulphasalazine, or placebo. Forty-seven (14%) of 331 patients receiving mesalazine reported adverse events, whereas 33 (23%) of 144 patients receiving sulphasalazine and 23 (19%) of 123 patients receiving placebo reported adverse effects. When lower doses of both mesalazine (0.75 g/day) and sulphasalazine (1.5 to 2.0 g/day) were evaluated in a maintenance trial, the percentage of adverse events was similar for both drugs--14% and 12%, respectively. In these trials the incidence of adverse effects was similar with both doses of mesalazine; however, doubling the sulphasalazine dose resulted in a twofold increase in adverse effects. In contrast, mesalazine appeared not to induce dose-related effects, suggesting that patients may be able to tolerate even higher mesalazine doses than those studied. The withdrawal rate owing to adverse events in all four controlled trials was similar for patients treated with mesalazine (6%) and sulphasalazine (8%). Results of an open postmarketing sampling trial of just over 1700 patients in Germany showed a low overall incidence of adverse effects (3%) with mesalazine and none of the rare, more serious effects, such as hepatoxicity, agranulocytosis, or pulmonary complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",1
364,8667468,"Increased matrix proteins, collagen and transforming growth factor are early markers of hepatotoxicity in patients on long-term methotrexate therapy","BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity, which may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, often limits the use of long-term low dose methotrexate for psoriasis and autoimmune diseases. Standard light microscopy lacks sensitivity for early fibrosis. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of immunohistochemical markers of early fibrosis including laminin and fibronectin, collagen deposition and lipocyte activation in hepatic biopsies of 36 psoriatic patients treated with methotrexate for one to five years, at an average dose of 20 mg/week. Biopsies before initiation of methotrexate (n = 36) showed minimal immunohistochemical expression of desmin, transforming growth factor alpha, matrix proteins, and collagen. Expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens III and IV increased significantly and progressively over baseline values after cumulative doses of 1.5 +/- 0.25 g (n = 20) and 3 +/- 0.5 g methotrexate, respectively. Increases in desmin, smooth muscle actin and collagen type I also occurred but the changes were less consistent. Light microscopic abnormalities of hepatotoxicity were not detectable in any of these biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical quantification of matrix proteins and collagens type III and IV may be early, sensitive and dose responsive markers of methotrexate hepatotoxicity which progress with increasing cumulative doses of methotrexate.",1
365,29195591,"Variability in motivational interviewing adherence across sessions, providers, sites, and research contexts","Providers' adherence in the delivery of behavioral interventions for substance use disorders is not fixed, but instead can vary across sessions, providers, and intervention sites. This variability can substantially impact the quality of intervention that clients receive. However, there has been limited work to systematically evaluate the extent to which substance use intervention adherence varies from session-to-session, provider-to-provider, and site-to-site. The present study quantifies the extent to which adherence to Motivational Interviewing (MI) for alcohol and drug use varies across sessions, providers, and intervention sites and compares the extent of this variability across three common MI research contexts that evaluate MI efficacy, MI effectiveness, and MI training. Independent raters coded intervention adherence to MI from 1275 sessions delivered by 216 providers at 15 intervention sites. Multilevel models indicated that 57%-94% of the variance in MI adherence was attributable to variability between sessions (i.e., within providers), while smaller proportions of variance were attributable to variability between providers (3%-26%) and between intervention sites (0.1%-28%). MI adherence was typically lowest and most variable within contexts evaluating MI training (i.e., where MI was not protocol-guided and delivered by community treatment providers) and, conversely, adherence was typically highest and least variable in contexts evaluating MI efficacy and effectiveness (i.e., where MI was highly protocolized and delivered by trained therapists). These results suggest that MI adherence in efficacy and effectiveness trials may be substantially different from that obtained in community treatment settings, where adherence is likely to be far more heterogeneous.

366,1591420,Fulminant hepatic failure possibly related to ciprofloxacin,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of hepatic failure in a patient who was receiving oral ciprofloxacin. DATA SOURCES: Case reports, review articles, and relevant laboratory studies identified by MEDLINE. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted from pertinent published sources by one author and reviewed by the remaining authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: A 66-year-old man was admitted for hip arthroplasty and developed fulminant hepatic failure during oral ciprofloxacin therapy. Ciprofloxacin was started on postoperative day 13 for treatment of a urinary tract infection. Over the next three days he became confused and hypoglycemic. His prothrombin time increased to greater than 90 s. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations were markedly elevated. The patient died on postoperative day 20. Postmortem examination of the liver revealed extensive centrilobular necrosis. A skin biopsy was consistent with a drug reaction. It is unknown whether the patient had received a quinolone compound in the past or had a history of exposure to hepatotoxins. CONCLUSIONS: It cannot be concluded that ciprofloxacin directly caused hepatic failure in this patient. It is possible that the drug evoked a hypersensitivity reaction or exacerbated a preexisting hepatotoxicity. A detailed patient history and evaluation of hepatic function should be obtained prior to initiating ciprofloxacin therapy. A nonquinolone antimicrobial may be a safer alternative for patients with hepatic dysfunction.",1

Thirteen kinds of different molecules with pendant NH2 group were used for modifications of the p(HEMA-GMA) films. The NH2 group served as anchor binding site for immobilization of functional groups on the hydrogel film via direct epoxy ring opening reaction. The modified hydrogel films were characterized by FTIR, and contact angle studies. In addition, mechanical properties of the hydrogel films were studied, and modified hydrogel films showed improved mechanical properties compared with the non-modified film, but they are less elastic than the non-modified film. The biological activities of these films such as platelet adhesion, red blood cells hemolysis, and swelling behavior were studied. The effect of modified hydrogel films, including NH2, (using different aliphatic CH2 chain lengths) CH3, SO3H, aromatic groups with substituted OH and COOH groups, and amino acids were also investigated on the adhesion, morphology and survival of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The MTT colorimetric assay reveals that the p(HEMA-GMA)-GA-AB, p(HEMA-GMA)-GA-Phe, p(HEMA-GMA)-GA-Trp, p(HEMA-GMA)-GA-Glu formulations have an excellent biocompatibility to promote the cell adhesion and growth. We anticipate that the fabricated p(HEMA-GMA) based hydrogel films with controllable surface chemistry and good stable swelling ratio may find extensive applications in future development of tissue engineering scaffold materials, and in various biotechnological areas.

In a group of 26 rats (13 with ACF and 13 sham operated), we assessed the degree of CHF. The ACF produced a significant rise in heart weight and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide. In a second group of 26 rats (13 ACF and 13 sham operated), we performed 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the gastrocnemius muscle during motor activity produced by electrical stimulation. The rate of phosphocreatine depletion, expressed by its initial slope, was higher in the ACF rats compared with controls (0.078 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.041 +/- 0.007; P < 0.03). pH and ATP decreased and phosphodiesters increased in all rats during electrical stimulation, with no difference between ACF rats and controls. The kinetics of phosphocreatine recovery were not different between ACF rats and controls. Together with previous studies, our present results suggest that muscle metabolism abnormalities in CHF may vary according to the experimental model and may be observed early in the course of the disease.

370,10347131,Biphasic clearance kinetics of hepatitis B virus from patients during adefovir dipivoxil therapy,"In a recent phase II clinical study, 13 chronic hepatitis B-infected patients treated daily with 30 mg adefovir dipivoxil for 12 weeks displayed a median 4.1-log10 decrease in plasma hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA levels. The decline of viral load during therapy displayed a biphasic kinetic profile that was modeled to determine the efficacy of inhibition of viral production, as well as kinetic constants for the clearance of free virus and the loss of infected cells. Viral production was suppressed with an efficacy of 0.993 +/- 0.008, indicating that only 0.7% of viral production persisted during therapy. The initial, faster phase of viral load decline reflects the clearance of HBV particles from plasma with a half-life of 1.1 +/- 0.3 days, translating to a 48% daily turnover of the free virus. The second, slower phase of viral load decline closely mirrors the rate-limiting process of infected cell loss, with a half-life of 18 +/- 7 days. The duration of therapy required to completely eliminate the virus from plasma or suppress it to levels sufficient to induce seroconversion is a function of the half-life of the free virus, the half-life of infected cells, and the efficacy of inhibition of virus production from infected cells. These quantitative analyses provide a more detailed picture of the dynamics of HBV infection and therapy, and can be used to compare the efficacy of various doses and inhibitors of HBV replication for the treatment of HBV infections.",0
371,3006502,Ontogeny of pepsin secretory response to secretagogues in isolated rat gastric glands,"By use of isolated gastric glands from rats at various ages, we demonstrated that full-term neonate and 1-day-old rats showed no response to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP), carbachol, or Ca2+ ionophore. The same glands, however, were responsive to dibutyryl cAMP. A mature response was not found until the pups were 2 days old. Injection of hydrocortisone into newborn rats led to an increase in pepsinogen concentrations in gastric glands and also an increased responsiveness to CCK-OP, carbachol, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 24 h after administration. Hydrocortisone thus caused precocious maturation of both pepsinogen accumulation and pepsinogen secretory responsiveness of gastric glands in rat pups. ",0
372,23323901,Simulation-based trial of surgical-crisis checklists,"BACKGROUND: Operating-room crises (e.g., cardiac arrest and massive hemorrhage) are common events in large hospitals but can be rare for individual clinicians. Successful management is difficult and complex. We sought to evaluate a tool to improve adherence to evidence-based best practices during such events. METHODS: Operating-room teams from three institutions (one academic medical center and two community hospitals) participated in a series of surgical-crisis scenarios in a simulated operating room. Each team was randomly assigned to manage half the scenarios with a set of crisis checklists and the remaining scenarios from memory alone. The primary outcome measure was failure to adhere to critical processes of care. Participants were also surveyed regarding their perceptions of the usefulness and clinical relevance of the checklists. RESULTS: A total of 17 operating-room teams participated in 106 simulated surgical-crisis scenarios. Failure to adhere to lifesaving processes of care was less common during simulations when checklists were available (6% of steps missed when checklists were available vs. 23% when they were unavailable, P<0.001). The results were similar in a multivariate model that accounted for clustering within teams, with adjustment for institution, scenario, and learning and fatigue effects (adjusted relative risk, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.42; P<0.001). Every team performed better when the crisis checklists were available than when they were not. A total of 97% of the participants reported that if one of these crises occurred while they were undergoing an operation, they would want the checklist used. CONCLUSIONS: In a high-fidelity simulation study, checklist use was associated with significant improvement in the management of operating-room crises. These findings suggest that checklists for use during operating-room crises have the potential to improve surgical care. (Funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.).",0
373,6811394,Valproate-induced hepatic injury: analyses of 23 fatal cases,"Analyses of 23 fatal instances of hepatic injury in patients taking valproic acid reveals that all but three were less than 20 years old, and all but four had been taking the drugs for more than 1 month. Convulsions, facial edema, lassitude, and vomiting were prominent clinical features. Hypoglycemia was recorded in six patients. Rash and eosinophilia were not seen. Values for transaminases were modestly elevated in most patients. Most levels of SGOT were below 500 IU, and SGPT levels were below 200 IU. Livers showed microvesicular steatosis in most patients, usually accompanies by necrosis. Four patients had cirrhosis. Overt valproic acid-induced hepatic injury appears to be rare and hence, by definition, idiosyncratic. That it may be an idiosyncratic exaggeration of a much more frequent phenomenon is suggested by the higher incidence of seemingly trivial injury. The idiosyncrasy appears to be metabolic rather than immunologic, and the available information leads to the plausible hypothesis that a metabolite is responsible for the microvesicular steatosis seen in most fatal cases. The steatosis resembles that of Reye's syndrome and Jamaican vomiting sickness, and there is reason to believe that the metabolite responsible for the steatosis resembles the agent responsible for Jamaican vomiting sickness. A different metabolite is presumably responsible for the necrosis seen in many of the cases.",1

These considerations have arisen because of their widespread use in recent years. Those involved in hepatic toxicity are the antimetabolites methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Bisulfin, bleomycin, and methotrexate have been linked to pulmonary toxicity. Daunomycin and adriamycin, used as anticarcinogens, are examined for their cardiac toxicity. Cyclophosphamide and streptozotocin affect the urinary tract. These drugs have specific toxic effects on fertility in both males, through its disruption of the testicular function, and in females, for ovarian disruptions. Antifolics, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and alkylating agents, used for therapy in pregnant women, particularly in the first 4 months, are linked to the appearance of fetal abnormalities.

The diagnosis of """"coumarin-induced hepatitis"""" is compatible with the time relationship between start of the drug and the onset of hepatopathy (first episode 8 months, second episode 4 weeks, and third episode 7 days), the rapid improvement following discontinuation of the drug, recurrence of liver dysfunction after re-exposure to the drug, and liver histology. After anticoagulant therapy was changed to heparin and acenocoumarol (Sintrom; Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), the patient's general state was markedly improved and her liver values became almost normal. This case will be discussed and compared with other reports of coumarin-induced hepatic lesions.

Our aim was to evaluate its safety profile in adjuvant treatment of high-risk melanoma patients in a single centre setting and to compare this safety profile with data obtained from the literature for a) low dose IFN-alpha and b) high dose IFN. Eighteen consecutive melanoma patients (AJCC 2002 stages IIa-IIIc) were retrospectively analyzed for toxicities associated with adjuvant PEG-IFN-alpha-2a (180 microg/week s.c.). The most frequently reported adverse events were constitutional side effects (78%), myelosuppression (83%) and hepatotoxicity (78%). The proportion of patients receiving PEG-IFN-alpha-2a and suffering from myelosuppression and liver toxicity was significantly higher than for patients reported in the literature undergoing low-dose IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.008, P = 0.001 respectively), while fatigue and depression were seen less frequently with PEG-IFN-alpha-2a. By contrast, compared to patients treated with high-dose IFN-alpha, PEG-IFN-alpha-2a treated patients less frequently experienced fatigue (P < 0.001), neutropenia (P < 0.068) and neuropsychiatric (statistically not significant) adverse events. In conclusion, subcutaneously delivered PEG-IFN-alpha-2a is well tolerated in a once-weekly dose of 180 mug by most patients with high risk malignant melanoma. The frequency of side effects is increased compared to low dose, but reduced compared to high dose standard IFN-alpha. Due to its pharmacokinetic properties, pegylated IFN-alpha has, as in the treatment of hepatitis C, potential for increased efficacy in adjuvant therapy of melanoma.",1
381,19293775,HSV-mediated transfer of artemin overcomes myelin inhibition to improve outcome after spinal cord injury,"Artemin is a neurotrophic factor of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands that acts through the GDNF family receptor alpha3 (GFRalpha3)/ret receptor found predominantly on sensory and sympathetic neurons. In order to explore the potential utility of artemin to improve functional outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI), we constructed a nonreplicating herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based vector to express artemin (QHArt). We found that QHArt efficiently transfects spinal cord neurons to produce artemin. Transgene-mediated artemin supported the extension of neurites by primary dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture, and allowed those cells to overcome myelin inhibition of neurite extension through activation of protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) and increase expression of arginase I. Intraspinal injection of QHArt immediately after thoracic spinal cord dorsal over hemisection produced a statistically significant improvement in motor recovery over the course of four weeks measured by locomotor rating score.

Both treatments were clinically effective: 98% of evaluable fluconazole-treated patients and 94% of evaluable clotrimazole-treated patients were cured or showed improvement (p = NS). Fluconazole was more effective than clotrimazole in eradicating Candida from the oral flora by the end of therapy (65% versus 48%) (p = 0.005). In addition, patients in the fluconazole-treated group were more likely to remain asymptomatic through the second week of follow-up (82.3% versus 50.0%) (p < 0.001). This difference was no longer evident by the post-therapy visit during week 4. Seven patients treated with clotrimazole and two patients treated with fluconazole discontinued therapy because of side effects. Two patients in the fluconazole group were withdrawn from therapy because of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels, one considered possibly related to drug therapy. Fluconazole was as effective as clotrimazole in the treatment of oral candidiasis and temporarily provided a more prolonged disease-free state. Future studies are needed to define the optimal regimen for both the treatment and prevention of recurrent oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, addressing special attention to the issue of compliance, cost, and emergence of resistance.",1
383,22993667,A rare cause of drug-induced hepatitis in an immunocompromised patient and the role of glutathione,"""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning on numerous herbal drugs, including many popular products at General Nutrition Centers (GNC), regarding unstudied hepatotoxicity. There have been recent reports of GNC products such as hydroxycut and herbalife, causing drug-induced hepatitis. Herbal medications are over-the-counter products and are not investigated thoroughly by the FDA. Given that the most common outpatient laboratory abnormality is elevated liver transaminases, a sign of hepatocellular toxicity; it is not surprising that some of these products end up causing hepatic dysfunction, especially when taken in large volume. There are numerous herbal supplements that are hepatotoxic, however, these medications have a much more significant effect in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients, which is secondary to depleted glutathione. We present a rare case of drug induced hepatitis secondary to herbal medications used to treat HIV and elucidate the role of glutathione depletion in immunocompromised patients.""",1
384,20062998,Effect of etanercept and entecavil in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who is a hepatitis B carrier: a review of the literature,"In this report, we describe a case of a 48-year-old Japanese woman who is a hepatitis B (HB) carrier with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She had the following antibody profile: HBs Ag(+), HBs Ab(-), HBe Ag(-), HBe Ab (+), HBc Ab(-) and undetectable HBV-DNA level. She was treated with auranofin, salazosulfapyridine, and bucillamine. Finally, she was treated with D: -penicillamine, but her disease activity remained elevated. Prophylactic treatment of entecavir 0.5 mg daily was started in March 2008 and all disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were stopped. After 2 weeks, etanercept monotherapy was started at 25 mg subcutaneously once a week. Significant improvement in clinical parameters of disease activity and well being was observed. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and HB virus viral load did not change significantly. Serum ALT, AST, and HB virus viral load were followed-up at every 3-month intervals, from initiation of therapy up to 24 months after the start of treatment with etanercept. We have also summarized the course of nine RA patients who received etanercept and were HB carriers or had chronic HB according to our literature search. Based on the results of our study, treatment of these patients with etanercept co-administered with lamivudine or entecavir appears to be safe.",1

386,23836169,Impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on bactericidal and sterilizing activity of a moxifloxacin-containing regimen in murine tuberculosis,"It has been shown previously that fluoroquinolone resistance (defined by resistance to at least 2 mg/liter ofloxacin) has a different impact on moxifloxacin monotherapy depending on the mutation in the sole fluoroquinolone target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, i.e., DNA gyrase. Since tuberculosis treatment relies on multidrug therapy, we wished to determine the impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on the bactericidal and sterilizing activity of a second-line antituberculous regimen containing moxifloxacin. A total of 280 mice were inoculated with the wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain or one of 3 isogenic fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant strains with increasing moxifloxacin resistance (the GyrB D500N, GyrA A90V, and GyrA D94G strains) and then treated for 6 months with a second-line regimen containing moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide supplemented with amikacin during the first 2 months. Mice were sacrificed during treatment for measurement of bactericidal activity and 3 months after treatment completion for measurement of relapse rates (sterilizing activity). The CFU counts decreased faster in mice inoculated with the wild type than in mice inoculated with the mutant strains. The relapse rate after treatment completion was different among mice inoculated with mutant strains in relation to the drug resistance level: wild type, 0%; GyrB D500N strain, 33%; GyrA A90V strain, 50%; and GyrA D94G strain, 86%. The relapse rate observed with the GyrB D500N strain was the only one not statistically different from that observed with the wild-type strain. We demonstrated that the impact on sterilizing activity of the most active second-line drug regimen containing moxifloxacin depends on the MIC of moxifloxacin. We suggest that the precise level of moxifloxacin resistance be determined for all strains resistant to 2 mg/liter ofloxacin.  ",0
387,602767,Liver ultrastructure in psoriatics related to methotrexate therapy. 2. Findings in bile ducts from 11 methotrexate treated psoriatics and 2 controls,To determinate what damage occurred in the bile ducts of psoriatics receiving Methotrexate (MTX) therapy liver biopsies from 11 patients were studied with the light and electron microscope and compared with normal material. Thick sections (1 micrometer) showed light and dark cells in biliary epithelium and lipofuscin granules. At the ultrastructural level these were confirmed. The lumen of the bile ducts contained debris. The microvilli were decreased in number and damaged forms appeared. Damage to the biliary epithelial mitochondria was widespread and there were foci of intracellular oedema. The Golgi apparatus was hypertrophied and dilated. Atrophic cells were seen. The lateral intercellular spaces were dilated and contained debris and the basement membrane showed zones of duplication. Similar changes were found in the ducts of Hering.,1
388,23651332,Effects of molybdenum on sperm quality and testis oxidative stress,"In order to investigate the effects of molybdenum (Mo) on sperm parameters and testicular oxidative stress, the ICR strain of adult mice were exposed to different doses of molybdenum for a sub-acute toxicity test. Compared to the control, our results showed that the sperm parameters, including the epididymis index, sperm motility, sperm count, and morphology, increased by a moderate dose of Mo (25 mg/L), but were negatively affected at high doses (≥ 100 mg/L). In addition, the changes of sperm parameters were accompanied with changes of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in testes. In conclusion, Mo affects the sperm quality through regulating the testicular oxidative stress in a complex manner. ",0
389,28083027,Relationship of coping ways and anxiety with Pregnancy Specific-stress,"To explore whether coping strategies and general anxiety are associated with pregnancy-specific stress (PSS) and how much of variance of PSS is explained with these variables. A cross sectional study was conducted at two teaching hospitals between November 2013 and December 2015. Total 190 pregnant women (60 women at 6-13-weeks of gestation, 60 at 13-26 weeks, and 70 at 27-40 weeks of gestation) completed the study. The participants completed three questionnaires including; Pregnancy experience scale (PES-41), Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and State-Trait anxiety inventory (SATI). Pearson coefficients and analysis of regression was done to assess the correlations between variables. Pregnant women who experienced higher mean level of pregnancy specific-stress had significantly higher mean level of occult anxiety, overt anxiety, and total anxiety than women who did not experience PSS. Although there was a positive and significant relationship between intensity of hassles and uplifts and ways of coping, the correlation between PSS and ways of coping was not significant. The results of analysis regression showed that general anxiety during pregnancy predicted 25% of the variance of PSS (F=4.480, β=0.159). Also, ways of coping predicted 38% of the variance in pregnancy Hassles (F=7.033, β=0.194). The ways of coping predicted the variance of pregnancy hassles, but does not evaluate pregnancy specific-stress. To think about PSS in terms of general anxiety may help to clarify past findings and to guide future research and interventions. ",0

METHODS: An international, phase III, randomized, open-label study in antiretroviral therapy-naive, HIV-infected adults. RESULTS: Patients with advanced HIV disease received FPV/r QD (n = 322) or NFV BID (n = 327). At week 48, 69% of patients in the FPV/r QD group and 68% in the NFV BID group had plasma HIV-1 RNA (vRNA) < 400 copies/ml, whereas 55% of patients in the FPV/r QD group and 53% in the NFV BID group had vRNA < 50 copies/ml (intent to treat, rebound/discontinuation = failure). More patients in the NFV BID group (17%) experienced virological failure than in the FPV/r QD group (7%). Efficacy of FPV/r QD was maintained in patients with CD4+ cell counts < 50 x 10 cells/l or vRNA >/= 100 000 copies/ml at entry. At week 48, median CD4+ cell counts were increased to 203 x 10 cells/l (FPV/r QD group) and 207 x 10 cells/l (NFV BID group). Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Diarrhea was more common on NFV BID than on FPV/r QD (16 versus 9%; P = 0.008). Fasting lipid profile results were generally favorable in both treatment arms. FPV/r QD maintained plasma amprenavir (APV) trough concentrations above the mean phenotypic drug-susceptibility (IC50) for wild-type virus for APV. CONCLUSION: As a first choice protease inhibitor with a low daily pill burden, FPV/r QD was well tolerated and provided potent, durable antiviral suppression.""",1
392,2391069,Lack of metabolic effects of cholecystokinin on hepatocytes,"We previously reported that the liver was the major organ that extracts small, biologically active, circulating forms of cholecystokinin. Although our work indicated extensive degradation of cholecystokinin extracted from plasma during its transit across the hepatocyte, it was unclear whether cholecystokinin might also have a physiological effect on this cell before its intracellular degradation. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that cholecystokinin has a direct biological effect on hepatocytes. Using freshly isolated or cultured hepatocytes, we studied whether cholecystokinin-octapeptide alters protein synthesis, affects amino acid transport or influences cytosolic free calcium concentrations. Using liver slices, we also determined the effect of cholecystokinin-octapeptide on cyclic nucleotide levels. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide, up to a concentration of 1 mumol/L, had no effect on the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into total hepatocyte protein; in contrast, comparable molar amounts of insulin stimulated protein synthesis by as much as 37% (ED50 = 1.5 x 10(-10) mol/L). Although insulin and glucagon stimulated the transport into hepatocytes of 14C-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, a nonmetabolizable amino acid analog, cholecystokinin-octapeptide had no affect Cholecystokinin-octapeptide also did not affect either the concentration of calcium in individual hepatocytes, as measured by digitized video microscopy using Fura-2, or the levels of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP in liver slices. Our results show that cholecystokinin has no effect on protein synthesis, on amino acid transport or on hepatocyte calcium and cyclic nucleotide levels. These and our previous data suggest that the primary outcome of hepatic extraction of cholecystokinin is hormone degradation.",0
393,23627662,"Effects of food processing and fibre content on the digestibility, energy intake and biochemical parameters of Blue-and-gold macaws (Ara ararauna L. - Aves, Psittacidae)","Considering the increased incidence of obesity and metabolic diseases in caged psittacines, the effect of fibre and food processing was evaluated in the Blue-and-gold macaw. Four food formulations (0%, 7%, 14% and 21% of sugarcane fibre) processed by pelleting or extrusion were studied, resulting in eight diets. To study digestibility, 48 macaws housed in pairs in cages was used in a block design. Subsequently, diets containing 0% or 21% sugarcane fibre, pelleted or extrude was fed for 4 months to evaluate energy intake and blood metabolites. A 2 × 2 × 2 (two fibre levels, two food processing methods and two genders) factorial arrangement with subplots (beginning and end) was used. When differences were detected in anova's F test, data were submitted to polynomial contrasts in the first experiment and to orthogonal contrasts in the second experiment (p < 0.05). Fibre addition reduced protein, fat and energy (p < 0.001) digestibility in both food processing. Pelleted foods presented higher dry matter digestibility and food metabolisable energy (ME) than the extruded ones (p < 0.05). Fibre addition or the type of processing did not change ME ingestion (p > 0.05). The macaws gained body weight (p < 0.05) regardless of the diet (p > 0.05), but females fed with the high-fibre diets did not gain weight (p > 0.05), suggesting a low food ME (12.5 kJ/g).The substitution of the original diet (sunflower seeds, fruits and cooked maize) by the experimental foods decreased the basal (12-h fast) concentrations of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.001). The consumption of pelleted diets reduced serum glucose and cholesterol (p < 0.05). Results suggest that the pelleted diets were more beneficial and can be used to reduce blood metabolites related to metabolic disorders that are commonly observed in macaws. ",0
394,8208269,Diabetes and the risk of pancreatic cancer,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes and pancreatic cancer are known to be associated, but the cause of the association and whether diabetes is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer remain controversial. METHODS: A total of 720 patients with pancreatic cancer and 720 control patients from 14 Italian centers were enrolled in the study. All subjects were interviewed personally and in detail about their clinical history. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on criteria recommended by the American Diabetes Association. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients with pancreatic cancer (22.8 percent) and 60 controls (8.3 percent) had diabetes. In the majority of the patients with pancreatic cancer (56.1 percent), diabetes was diagnosed either concomitantly with the cancer (in 40.2 percent), or within two years before the diagnosis of cancer (in 15.9 percent). The association between the two conditions was significant (odds ratio, 3.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.21 to 4.17). However, when only patients with diabetes of three or more years' duration were considered, the association was no longer significant (odds ratio, 1.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.98 to 2.07). All the patients with pancreatic cancer whose diabetes had been diagnosed before the cancer had non-insulin-dependent diabetes; all but one of the control patients with diabetes had the non-insulin-dependent form of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer is frequently of recent onset and is presumably caused by the tumor. Diabetes is not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.",0

At the outset it sounds excellent for the use in the elderly diabetic population, because of its minimal tendency to cause hypoglycemia. However, the clinician needs to exercise caution as it needs to be dosed renally. The clinician needs to be circumspect about potential drug interactions, especially when there is an underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Also its use is best avoided in people who are predisposed to genital mycotic and urinary tract infections (UTI).  ",0

Twenty body builders were studied at the end of a course of AS (group 1) and 42 body builders were studied after discontinuation of the AS for a mean of 5 months (group 2). Sixteen body builders were studied after discontinuation of AS for at least 2 months and at the end of a 9-week course of AS (group 3). A group of 13 body builders who never used AS served as a control group. Both groups 1 and 2 showed higher levels of transaminas and a higher systolic blood pressure than the controls (P less than 0.05). Group 3 showed an increase of the transaminases an a slight but significant increase of systolic blood pressure (+3 mm Hg) and heart rate (+7 bts/min) after one course of AS (P less than 0.05).

Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer,"""Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which unleash a patient's own T cells to kill tumors, are revolutionizing cancer treatment. To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non-small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti-PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape of lung cancers shapes response to anti-PD-1 therapy.""",1

Given its therapeutic significance has been deeply studied in the last decades.LR is an extraordinary complex process, strictly regulated, which accomplishes the characteristics of the most evolutionary biologic systems (robustness) and explains the difficulties of reshaping it with therapeutic goals.TH reproduces the physiological tissue damage response pattern, with a first phase of priming of the hepatocytes-cell-cycle transition G0-G1–, and a second phase of proliferation –cell-cycleS/M phases– which ends with the liver mass recovering. This process has been related with the tissue injury response regulators as: complement system, platelets, inflammatory cytokines(TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6), growth factors (HGF, EGF, VGF) and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-b).Given its complexity and strict regulation, illustrates the unique alternative to liver failure is liver transplantation.The recent induced pluripotential cells (iPS) description and the mesenchymal stem cell (CD133+) plastic capability have aroused new prospects in the cellular therapy field. Those works have assured the cooperation between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Herein, we review the physiologic mechanisms of liver regeneration. ",0
399,15074795,Ammonia emissions from swine houses in the southeastern United States,"Ammonia (NH3) from confined animal feeding operations is emitted from several sources including lagoons, field applications, and houses. This paper presents studies that were conducted to evaluate NH3 emissions from swine finisher and sow animal houses in the southeastern USA. Management and climate variables including animal weight, feed consumption, housing gutter water temperature, total time fans operated per day, house air temperature, house ambient NH3 concentration, and animal numbers were measured to determine their individual and combined effect on NH3 emissions. Ammonia emissions varied on daily and seasonal bases with higher emissions during warmer periods. For finishers, the summertime housing emissions on a per-animal basis were 2.4 times higher than wintertime (7.0 vs. 3.3 g NH3 animal(-1) d(-1)) or 3.2 times higher when compared on an animal unit (AU) basis (1 AU = 500 kg) because of climate and animal size differences between measurement periods. For summertime, the emission factor for the finishing pigs was 7.8 times higher than for sows on an animal basis and 25.6 times higher on an AU basis. Simple models were developed for housing emissions based on (i) all measured factors that were independent of each other and (ii) on three commonly measured management factors. The two models explained 97 and 64%, respectively, of variations in emissions. Ammonia emissions were found to be somewhat less than other studies on the same type housing due to more representative housing concentration measurements and calibration of exhaust fans; thus, emission factors for these type houses will be less than previously thought.

402,10607813,Treatment of allergic asthma with monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. rhuMAb-E25 Study Group,"BACKGROUND: Immune responses mediated by IgE are important in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. A recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb-E25) forms complexes with free IgE and blocks its interaction with mast cells and basophils. We studied the efficacy of rhuMab-E25 as a treatment for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. METHODS: After a 4-week run-in period, we randomly assigned 317 subjects (age range, 11 to 50 years) who required inhaled or oral corticosteroids (or both) to receive either placebo or one of two regimens of rhuMAB-E25: high-dose rhuMAb-E25 (5.8 microg per kilogram of body weight per nanogram of IgE per milliliter or low-dose rhuMAb-E25 (2.5 microg per kilogram per nanogram of IgE per milliliter) intravenously on days 0 (half a dose), 4 (half a dose), and 7 (full dose) and then once every 2 weeks thereafter for 20 weeks. For the first 12 weeks of the study, the subjects continued the regimen of corticosteroids they had received before enrollment. During the following eight weeks, the doses of corticosteroids were tapered in an effort to discontinue this therapy. The primary outcome measure was an improvement in the asthma symptom score at 12 weeks, according to a 7-point scale, in which a score of 1 indicated no symptoms and a score of 7 the most severe symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 106 subjects were assigned to receive a high dose of rhuMAb-E25, 106 were assigned to receive a low dose, and 105 were assigned to receive placebo. At base line, the mean asthma symptom score was 4.0. After 12 weeks of therapy, the mean (+/-SE) scores were 2.8+/-0.1 in the high-dose group (P=0.008) and 2.8+/-0.1 in the low-dose group (P=0.005), as compared with 3.8+/-0.1 in the placebo group. At 20 weeks, the mean scores were 2.7+/-0.1 in both the high-dose group (P=0.048) and the low-dose group (P=0.14), as compared with 2.9+/-0.1 in the placebo group. More subjects in the two rhuMAb-E25 groups were able to decrease or discontinue their use of corticosteroids than in the placebo group, but only some of the differences were significant. After 20 weeks, serum free IgE concentrations decreased by a mean of more than 95 percent in both rhuMAb-E25 groups. The therapy was well tolerated. After 20 weeks, none of the subjects had antibodies against rhuMAb-E25. CONCLUSIONS: A recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IgE has potential as a treatment for subjects with moderate or severe allergic asthma.",1

404,25564662,Genetic dissection of pheromone processing reveals main olfactory system-mediated social behaviors in mice,"Most mammals have two major olfactory subsystems: the main olfactory system (MOS) and vomeronasal system (VNS). It is now widely accepted that the range of pheromones that control social behaviors are processed by both the VNS and the MOS. However, the functional contributions of each subsystem in social behavior remain unclear. To genetically dissociate the MOS and VNS functions, we established two conditional knockout mouse lines that led to either loss-of-function in the entire MOS or in the dorsal MOS. Mice with whole-MOS loss-of-function displayed severe defects in active sniffing and poor survival through the neonatal period. In contrast, when loss-of-function was confined to the dorsal MOB, sniffing behavior, pheromone recognition, and VNS activity were maintained. However, defects in a wide spectrum of social behaviors were observed: attraction to female urine and the accompanying ultrasonic vocalizations, chemoinvestigatory preference, aggression, maternal behaviors, and risk-assessment behaviors in response to an alarm pheromone. Functional dissociation of pheromone detection and pheromonal induction of behaviors showed the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON)-regulated social behaviors downstream from the MOS. Lesion analysis and neural activation mapping showed pheromonal activation in multiple amygdaloid and hypothalamic nuclei, important regions for the expression of social behavior, was dependent on MOS and AON functions. Identification of the MOS-AON-mediated pheromone pathway may provide insights into pheromone signaling in animals that do not possess a functional VNS, including humans.  ",0
405,10366792,An Italian national multicenter study for the definition of reference ranges for normal values of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in healthy adults,"Reference ranges are necessary in clinical chemistry and hematology to compare an observed value and to provide meaningful information. The aim of this multicenter study was the definition of reference ranges of the relative and absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets by evaluating a large cohort of healthy adults and by using a standard protocol to reduce the variability in both sample preparation methodology and flow cytometer operation. Other aims of this study were the evaluation of the influence of sex, age, obesity, smoking, sport and some methodological variables on lymphocyte subsets and the comparison of differential white blood cell values obtained by flow cytometry and those obtained by hematology counters. Blood samples from 1311 healthy adults (blood donors and volunteers chosen according to the Italian law for donor selection) were analyzed to study, by flow cytometry, the immunophenotype of lymphocyte subsets and their distribution in terms of percentages and absolute values. Pre-analytical and analytical phases were performed according to the guidelines of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the Italian Group of Cytometry (GIC). T cells were defined by the expression of CD3; T subpopulations by the coexpression of CD4 or CD8 or HLA-DR; B-lymphocytes were identified by the expression of CD19 while natural killer lymphocytes were identified by positivity of CD16 and/or CD56 without CD3. We calculated, for each laboratory and for all data collected, the frequency distribution percent values and absolute values of each lymphocyte subset. The influence of age, sex, smoking, obesity and sport was calculated by the t-test. The influence of some methodological variables was calculated by the t-test and multiple regression test. Fifty-three flow cytometry laboratories at different institutions in Italy participated in this study. Data was obtained from 1311 healthy adults aged from 18 to 70; 968 phenotype analyses (74%) were considered eligible for statistical analysis. Significant results were found as regards sex, smoking and some methodological variables (quantity of sample, washing procedures, brand of monoclonal antibodies and kind of instruments used). The comparison between hematology counters and cytometers showed no difference for any of the parameters considered. The large number of cases, the different kinds of laboratories and their distribution throughout the country make our sample representative of the Italian adult population. The standardization criteria of pre-analytical and analytical phases (the most important issues in evaluating reference values for an indicator) assured good reproducibility among laboratories so that the obtained reference ranges may be useful for interlaboratory comparison of results. Instruments and the brand of monoclonal antibodies may represent an inevitable cause of variability. ",0
406,22041509,Chemotherapy before liver resection of colorectal metastases: friend or foe?,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature to critically assess benefits and risks of the use of preoperative chemotherapy in patients presenting with colorectal liver metastases. BACKGROUND: In many centers, chemotherapy is used before hepatic resection of colorectal metastases, even in the presence of a single lesion. Application of chemotherapy requires clear conceptual distinction between patients presenting with resectable lesions (neoadjuvant) versus patients presenting with unresectable lesions, for which chemotherapy is used to reach a resectable situation (downsizing). METHODS: The literature (PubMed) was systematically reviewed for publications related to liver surgery and chemotherapy according to the methodology recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: For unresectable liver metastases, combination regimens result in enhanced tumor response and resectability rates up to 30%, although the additional benefit from targeted agents such as bevacizumab or cetuximab is marginal. For resectable lesions, studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy failed to convincingly demonstrate a survival benefit. Most reports described increased postoperative complications in a subset of patients due to parenchymal alterations such as chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. CONCLUSION: Preoperative standard chemotherapy can be recommended for downsizing unresectable liver metastases, but not for resectable lesions, for which adjuvant chemotherapy is preferred.",1
407,17996663,Methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice in an elderly hyperthyroid patient,"BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism is a common disease in the elderly. Antithyroid medications such as methimazole are one of the few treatment options. CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with a 1-week history of fatigue, sleepiness, 7-pound weight loss, and tachycardia. Her blood work showed low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and high levels of free thyroxine. Due to persistence of her symptoms, she was hospitalized and started on methimazole 10 mg TID. Six weeks after receiving methimazole for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, she had severe jaundice and itching. Results of her liver function tests showed elevation of her alkaline phosphatase and liver transaminase levels, as well as hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. Methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice was diagnosed. Her symptoms gradually improved after discontinuation of the medication, and plasma bilirubin levels were near normal after 8 weeks without methimazole. CONCLUSIONS: We report here a probable association between methimazole use and severe cholestatic jaundice in an elderly hyperthyroid patient. The patient's jaundice was reversed after drug discontinuation.",1
408,31383749,Direct and Specific Functional Evaluation of the Nrf2 and MafG Heterodimer by Introducing a Tethered Dimer into Small Maf-Deficient Cells,"A group of cytoprotective genes is regulated by heterodimers composed of the cap'n'collar (CNC) family member Nrf2 and one of the small Maf (sMaf) proteins (MafF, MafG, or MafK) through the antioxidant response element (ARE, also referred to as the CNC-sMaf binding element [CsMBE]). Many lines of evidence support this model; however, a direct and specific evaluation of the Nrf2-sMaf heterodimer remains to be executed. To address this issue, we constructed a tethered Nrf2-MafG (T-N2G) heterodimer using a flexible linker peptide. We then introduced the T-N2G construct into cells lacking all three sMaf proteins to specifically evaluate the function of the tethered heterodimer without interference from other endogenous CNC-sMaf heterodimers or sMaf homodimers. In response to an Nrf2 activator, diethyl maleate, the T-N2G protein can widely activate the target genes of Nrf2 but not those of Nrf1, such as proteasome subunit genes. Genome-wide binding analysis showed that the T-N2G protein preferentially bound to the CsMBE motifs in the regulatory regions of the Nrf2 target genes. These results provide direct evidence that the Nrf2-MafG heterodimer acts as a transcriptional activator of Nrf2-dependent genes and show that this assay system will be a powerful tool to specifically examine the function of other CNC-sMaf heterodimers.

409,23390091,Implication of the proprotein convertases in iron homeostasis: proprotein convertase 7 sheds human transferrin receptor 1 and furin activates hepcidin,"The first seven members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family activate protein precursors by cleavage after basic residues. While PC7 has no known specific substrates, it shows redundancy with other PCs. A genome-wide association study suggested that circulating levels of shed human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) are regulated by PC7. We thus examined whether hTfR1 constitutes a specific substrate for PC7. Coexpression of hTfR1 with PCs in several cell lines indicated that PC7 is the only convertase that sheds this receptor into the medium. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that cleavage occurs at the unusual site KTECER100 ?LA, in which the P1 Arg100 and P6 Lys95 are critical. Pharmacological treatments revealed that shedding of hTfR1 by PC7 requires endocytosis into acidic clathrin-coated vesicles. A PC7 chimera, in which the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail of PC7 were replaced by that of the convertase furin, lost its ability to cleave the receptor, demonstrating the importance of these domains in the regulation of PC7 function. Analysis of primary hepatocytes from mice lacking furin, PC5, PACE4, or PC7 revealed that hepcidin, which limits iron availability in the circulation, is specifically generated by furin and not by PC7. Finally, depletion of iron in the medium of hepatoma cell lines incubated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine resulted in PC7 down-regulation. CONCLUSION: Among the PC family members, only furin activates hepcidin in hepatocytes, and uniquely the full-length membrane-bound PC7 can directly shed hTfR1 by cleavage at Arg100 ?. Our results support the notion that, when iron is limiting, hTfR1 levels increase at least in part by way of the down-regulation of PC7 expression. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;).",0
410,22397651,Donepezil and memantine for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether treatment benefits continue after the progression to moderate-to-severe disease. METHODS: We assigned 295 community-dwelling patients who had been treated with donepezil for at least 3 months and who had moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (a score of 5 to 13 on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE, on which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function]) to continue donepezil, discontinue donepezil, discontinue donepezil and start memantine, or continue donepezil and start memantine. Patients received the study treatment for 52 weeks. The coprimary outcomes were scores on the SMMSE and on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, on which scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). The minimum clinically important differences were 1.4 points on the SMMSE and 3.5 points on the BADLS. RESULTS: Patients assigned to continue donepezil, as compared with those assigned to discontinue donepezil, had a score on the SMMSE that was higher by an average of 1.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.5) and a score on the BADLS that was lower (indicating less impairment) by 3.0 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Patients assigned to receive memantine, as compared with those assigned to receive memantine placebo, had a score on the SMMSE that was an average of 1.2 points higher (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P<0.001) and a score on the BADLS that was 1.5 points lower (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8; P=0.02). The efficacy of donepezil and of memantine did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the other. There were no significant benefits of the combination of donepezil and memantine over donepezil alone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, continued treatment with donepezil was associated with cognitive benefits that exceeded the minimum clinically important difference and with significant functional benefits over the course of 12 months.

411,14502318,"The effects of sibutramine and orlistat on the ultrasonographic findings, insulin resistance and liver enzyme levels in obese patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis","""OBJECTIVE: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is frequent in obese subjects and has a relatively benign course; however, it may progress to cirrhosis. Weight loss in these patients may alleviate the findings of NASH. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pharmacological anti-obesity therapies on the findings of NASH. SUBJECTS: There were thirteen patients (9 women, 4 men) in sibutramine group and 12 patients (8 women, 4 men) in orlistat group. The mean ages and body-mass indexes of the two groups were 42.5 years, 37.3 kg/m2 and 43.2 years, 36.1 kg/m2, respectively. METHOD: The obese subjects with NASH were given sibutramine or orlistat for six months. Additionally, all patients were given a low caloric diet. Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT and ALP), insulin resistance (analysed by HOMA) and hepatic ultrasound (US) findings were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Both sibutramine and orlistat significantly reduced body weight (10.2 and 8.4%, respectively), insulin resistance (47 and 40%, respectively), AST (41 and 39%, respectively), ALT (59 and 58%, respectively), and GGT serum levels (27 and 25%, respectively). The ultrasonographic regression in steatosis was observed in 11 patients who received sibutramine and 8 patients who received orlistat. During the treatment, unexpectedly significant increases in total alkaline phosphatase levels were found in both sibutramine and orlistat groups (9 and 14%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present study shows that both sibutramine-induced and orlistat-induced weight losses result in reduction of insulin resistance, and improvements in biochemical markers and US findings of NASH. Because the GGT levels decreased in both groups, the increased ALP levels might have another source.""",1
412,25000900,"Characterization of a genetic and antigenic variant of avian paramyxovirus 6 isolated from a migratory wild bird, the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis)","A hemagglutinating virus (8KS0813) was isolated from a red-necked stint. Hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests indicated that 8KS0813 was antigenically related to a prototype strain, APMV-6/duck/Hong Kong/18/199/77, but with an 8- and 16-fold difference, respectively, in their titers. The full genome sequence of 8KS0813 showed 98.6 % nucleotide sequence identity to that of APMV-6/duck/Italy/4524-2/07, which has been reported to belong to an APMV-6 subgroup, and showed less similarity to that of the prototype strain (70.6 % similarity). The growth of 8KS0813 and the prototype strain in four different cell cultures was greatly enhanced by adding trypsin. Interestingly, this virus induced syncytia only in Vero cells. 8KS0813 was identified as APMV-6/red-necked stint/Japan/8KS0813/08, but it is antigenically and genetically distinguishable from the prototype strain, suggesting that variant APMV-6 is circulating in migratory birds.

413,16389032,Nevirapine toxicity in a cohort of HIV-1-infected pregnant women,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to complete an evaluation of nevirapine (NVP) toxicity in a cohort of HIV+ pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 611 women followed from January 1996 to December 2003. All women who used NVP for > 7 days were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test independent association of CD4 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection related to the outcome of toxic effects of NVP. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven women were exposed to NVP for > 7 days, and toxicity occurred in 11 (5.6%), leading to drug discontinuation in 7 patients. One case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurred. No serious liver toxicity occurred except for 1 grade 4 cholestasis. Median CD4 was 344 in women without toxicities and 298 in women with toxicities. HCV was the only significant factor associated to toxicity by logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] 15.61, P = .001). CONCLUSION: NVP toxicities occurred in a very small fraction of patients and were not associated with fatalities.",1
414,7641903,"Flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism: long-term clinical effects, endocrine changes, and androgen receptor behavior","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effects of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters, as well as on the androgen receptor status, in hirsute women. DESIGN: Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide, three times per day for 12 months. Barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women. Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study. Hirsutism, graded by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score, and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4-month intervals during treatment. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy. In addition, the concentration of androgen receptors in mononuclear leukocytes was measured, in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, basally and after 4 months of flutamide treatment. RESULTS: Flutamide was well tolerated in all women, with the noticeable exception of one patient who presented increased serum transaminase after 8 months of therapy. Hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment (Ferriman-Gallwey score after 1 year: 4.1 +/- 0.5 versus 14.1 +/- 0.9). A reduction of serum androgens was found, whereas no change was observed in either basal or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone response to ACTH. Cycles remained ovulatory. Before treatment, the number of androgen receptors was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase. This rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug. CONCLUSIONS: Flutamide is effective in the treatment of hirsutism but requires constant surveillance of liver function. Androgen receptor blockade might be potentiated by a reduction of serum androgens. Flutamide affects androgen receptor behavior during the menstrual cycle. The meaning of this finding remains to be elucidated.",1
415,19287732,Effect of Age on Body Wall Cuticle Morphology of Heterodera schachtii Schmidt females,"Fine structure of the body wall cuticle of Heterodera schachtii is compared with respect to age and body region of the female. The cuticle is more complex than previously reported. In newly molted females only layers A, B, and C are present, but 4 weeks after the final molt a thin D layer is present between the midbody and base of the cone. This D layer is absent in the cone of H. schachtii, regardless of age. As females age, an additional layer E is produced and includes zones E and E. Zone El apparently is unique to H. schachtii, whereas E is likely to be homologous with a similar layer in Atalodera. In the cone of old females (ca. 8 weeks after the final molt) of H. schachtii, the two zones become irregular in shape and comprise bullae. The presence of a thin D layer in Heterodera strengthens the previous hypothesis of a single ancestor of cyst nematodes. ",0
416,2108331,Do the poor cost more? A multihospital study of patients' socioeconomic status and use of hospital resources,"There is controversy about whether hospitalized poor patients use more resources and whether hospitals that provide care for the poor therefore merit supplementary payment under per-case prospective payment systems. We previously reported that patients of low socioeconomic status with connective-tissue disease had longer hospital stays and higher costs than patients of higher socioeconomic status at a single hospital. To examine the generalizability of this phenomenon, we interviewed 16,908 (83 percent) of 20,278 consecutive adult patients (excluding obstetrical and psychiatric patients) admitted in 1987 to five Massachusetts hospitals, to obtain information on three direct measures of socioeconomic status (income, occupation, and education). We divided each measure into three strata. Thus, there were 15 comparisons--three measures of socioeconomic status applied to each of five hospitals. After excluding outliers and adjusting for diagnosis-related group (DRG), we found that the patients of the lowest socioeconomic status had hospital stays 3 to 30 percent longer than those of patients of higher status, the differences varying with the hospital and the indicator of socioeconomic status (P less than or equal to 0.05 for 11 of the 15 comparisons). Hospital charges were 1 to 18 percent higher for the patients of lowest socioeconomic status than for those of higher status (P less than or equal to 0.05 for 9 of 15 comparisons). When we adjusted for age, severity of illness, and DRG, the patients of lowest socioeconomic status had longer stays than those of higher status in 14 of 15 comparisons (P less than 0.05 for 7 of the 15) and higher charges in 13 of 15 comparisons (P less than 0.05 for 6 of the 15). The differences between patients of high and low status ranged up to 21 percent for length of stay and 13 percent for charges. Our findings suggest that hospitalized patients of lower socioeconomic status have longer stays and probably require more resources. Supplementary payments to hospitals for the treatment of poor patients merit further consideration.",0

A systematic review of existing literature and a meta-analysis were carried out. After a comprehensive search, studies were included if 2 x 2 tables for outcomes poor response and pregnancy in IVF patients in relation to AMH or AFC could be constructed. Academic referral center for tertiary care. Cases indicated for IVF. None. Poor response and nonpregnancy after IVF. A total of 13 studies were found reporting on AMH and 17 on AFC. Because of heterogeneity among studies, calculation of a summary point estimate for sensitivity and specificity was not possible. However, for both tests summary receiver operating characteristic curves for the outcome measures poor response and nonpregnancy could be estimated and compared. The curves for the prediction of poor response indicated no significant difference between the performances of AMH and AFC. For the prediction of nonpregnancy, poor performance for both AMH and AFC was found. In this meta-analysis it was shown that AMH has at least the same level of accuracy and clinical value for the prediction of poor response and nonpregnancy as AFC. ",0
418,18943671,Characterization of Race-Specific Interactions Among Isolates of Verticillium dahliae Pathogenic on Lettuce,"ABSTRACT Verticillium wilt, caused by Verticillium dahliae, poses a major threat to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) production in California. Incorporation of resistance into commercial lettuce cultivars offers the least expensive technique of sustaining production in infested areas. To test the breadth of the resistance identified in field experiments, a pair of susceptible ('Salinas' and 'Sniper') and resistant ('La Brillante' and 'Little Gem') lettuce cultivars were used as differentials and individually inoculated with 29 isolates of V. dahliae and two isolates of V. albo-atrum from several hosts, including lettuce, in replicated greenhouse experiments. The reactions of the four cultivars were determined based on the disease severity at maturity. None of the V. albo-atrum isolates or V. dahliae isolates from cruciferous hosts caused significant disease on lettuce. Both Salinas and Sniper were susceptible to many isolates of V. dahliae (21 of 23) from noncruciferous hosts, and the isolates varied in their overall virulence. However, of these, only three isolates caused significant disease on the resistant cvs. La Brillante and Little Gem. These three isolates also were distinct from the other V. dahliae isolates based on sequence data from the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, suggesting that they form a phylogenetically distinct subgroup that differs in virulence toward specific lettuce genotypes. Accordingly, isolates of V. dahliae virulent on all tested cultivars, including the resistant La Brillante and Little Gem, were designated as race 2, whereas those virulent only on the susceptible Salinas and Sniper were designated as race 1. Although a range of virulence among isolates has been described in other hosts, this is the first description of distinct virulence phenotypes in V. dahliae since a similar race structure was described in tomato in the 1960s.

419,15051058,Structure-activity studies for a novel series of tricyclic dihydropyridopyrazolones and dihydropyridoisoxazolones as K(ATP) channel openers,"In search of a novel chemotype of K(ATP) channel openers a series of tricyclic dihydropyridopyrazolones and dihydropyridoisoxazolones was synthesized. It was found that cyclopentanone in the left hand portion of the molecule was 4-fold more potent than cyclohexanone. Introduction of gem-dimethyl groups as well as incorporation of oxygen in the cyclohexanone ring in the left hand portion of the molecule increased the potency 10-fold. In the right hand portion of the molecule, the NH-group of the pyrazolone can be effectively substituted by oxygen increasing the activity 5-fold. Incorporation of a methyl group adjacent to the dihydropyridine (DHP) nitrogen not only significantly boosted activity, but also provided an additional benefit of increased metabolic stability. In vitro tests on the tissue from pig bladder strips provided further confirmation of K(ATP) activity of these compounds. ",0

VM-26 60 mg/m2 i.v. infusion over 30-45 minutes was given daily for 5 days every 21 days. Twenty-one eligible patients with measurable disease and a SWOG performance status of 0-2 were analyzed for response and toxicity. Partial responses were seen in 2 of the 21 eligible patients (9.5%). Median survival was 3.8 months. Severe of life-threatening toxicity was observed in 13/21 (62%) patients. This included two drug related deaths related to neutropenic sepsis and seven other patients with grade 4 granulocytopenia (< 500/mm3). Liver dysfunction and hypotension were seen less often and were not dose limiting. Although the modest activity seen was comparable to that of VP-16 (etoposide) as a single agent, the hematologic toxicity observed in this trial would likely preclude further trials of VM-26 (teniposide) in advanced gastric cancer.",1
421,25705404,"Limitations of global end-diastolic volume index as a parameter of cardiac preload in the early phase of severe sepsis: a subgroup analysis of a multicenter, prospective observational study","In patients with severe sepsis, depression of cardiac performance is common and is often associated with left ventricular (LV) dilatation to maintain stroke volume. Although it is essential to optimize cardiac preload to maintain tissue perfusion in patients with severe sepsis, the optimal preload remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI) as a parameter of cardiac preload in the early phase of severe sepsis. Ninety-three mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to sepsis were enrolled for subgroup analysis in a multicenter, prospective, observational study. Patients were divided into two groups-with sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) and without SIMD (non-SIMD)-according to a threshold LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% on the day of enrollment. Both groups were further subdivided according to a threshold stroke volume variation (SVV) of 13% as a parameter of fluid responsiveness. On the day of enrollment, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.421, p = 0.045) between GEDI and SVV in the SIMD group, whereas this paradoxical correlation was not found in the non-SIMD group and both groups on day 2. To evaluate the relationship between attainment of cardiac preload optimization and GEDI value, GEDI with SVV ≤13% and SVV >13% was compared in both the SIMD and non-SIMD groups. SVV ≤13% implies the attainment of cardiac preload optimization. Among patients with SIMD, GEDI was higher in patients with SVV >13% than in patients with SVV ≤13% on the day of enrollment (872 [785-996] mL/m(2) vs. 640 [597-696] mL/m(2); p < 0.001); this finding differed from the generally recognized relationship between GEDI and SVV. However, GEDI was not significantly different between patients with SVV ≤13% and SVV >13% in the non-SIMD group on the day of enrollment and both groups on day 2. In the early phase of severe sepsis in mechanically ventilated patients, there was no constant relationship between GEDI and fluid reserve responsiveness, irrespective of the presence of SIMD. GEDI should be used as a cardiac preload parameter with awareness of its limitations. ",0

With continuous IV treprostinil having potential advantages over both of the above therapies, we investigated the safety and efficacy of this regimen in patients with PAH. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study of continuous IV treprostinil in 16 patients with PAH that was idiopathic (n = 8), related to connective tissue disease (n = 6), or related to congenital heart disease (n = 2). The primary end point was change from baseline to week 12 in exercise capacity assessed by the 6-min walk (6MW) test. RESULTS: Continuous IV treprostinil increased 6MW distance (mean +/- SE) by 82 m from baseline (319 +/- 22 m) to week 12 (400 +/- 26 m) [n = 14; p = 0.001]. There were also significant improvements in the secondary end points of Naughton-Balke treadmill time (p = 0.007), Borg dyspnea score (p = 0.008), and hemodynamics (mean pulmonary artery pressure, p = 0.03; cardiac index, p = 0.002; pulmonary vascular resistance, p = 0.001) at week 12 compared with baseline. Side effects were mild and consistent with those reported with prostacyclin treatment. One death, unrelated to study drug, occurred during the 12-week study in a patient who received 3 days of treprostinil and died 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term IV infusion of treprostinil is safe and appears to be effective for the treatment of patients with PAH.""",1
424,31400086,Preserved expressive language as a phenotypic determinant of Mosaic Angelman Syndrome,"Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with core features of intellectual disability, speech impairment, movement disorders, and a unique behavioral profile. Typically, AS results from absent maternal expression of UBE3A, but some individuals have imprinting defects in a portion of their cells. These individuals are mosaic for normal and defective UBE3A expression, resulting in mosaic AS (mAS) with a partial loss of gene expression. This study aims to contrast the mAS phenotype to that of AS. Clinical characteristics of mAS were obtained from a parental survey of 22 mAS patients and from the Angelman Natural History study. These were contrasted with those of AS using historical data. Developmental delay was present in nearly all mAS patients, whereas the core features of AS were reported in less than 40%. While language and ability to manage activities of daily living were markedly improved over that expected in AS, mAS patients demonstrated a high incidence of behavioral challenges. Clinical work-up of an individual with developmental delay, hyperactivity, anxiety, and an uncharacteristically happy demeanor should prompt methylation studies to rule out mAS. We expand the phenotypic spectrum of AS to include features that overlap with Prader-Willi such as hyperphagia. ",0
425,9328323,"Induction of cMrp/cMoat gene expression by cisplatin, 2-acetylaminofluorene, or cycloheximide in rat hepatocytes","The human multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP), a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter superfamily, is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells resistant to antineoplastic drugs. In the rat, two Mrp isoforms have been identified, Mrp and cMrp. cMrp, also called Mrp2 or cMoat (canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter), is expressed in the canalicular membrane of rat hepatocytes and mediates the excretion of glucuronate, sulfate, and glutathione conjugates into bile. We investigated the expression of cMrp and Mrp in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Treatment with the chemical carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), the antineoplastic drug cisplatin, and the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide led to a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in cmrp gene expression. A 347-base pair cmrp complementary DNA (cDNA) probe served to demonstrate the induction of cmrp messenger RNA (mRNA) with 40 micromol/L 2-AAF, 5 micromol/L cisplatin, or 5 micromol/L cycloheximide. An analogous response was obtained for the increase in cMrp protein. Mrp mRNA was below the detection limit in Northern blots of RNA from liver and hepatocyte cultures, in contrast to rat testis mRNA which served as a positive control. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured hepatocytes was used to visualize cMrp in the plasma membrane. Treatment with 2-AAF led to a marked increase in the immunofluorescence signal confirming the cMrp-inducing potency of 2-AAF. In conclusion, the inducing effect of the compounds studied may reflect a general inducibility of hepatic cMrp by a variety of cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and chemotherapeutic agents which is likely to be of relevance for the acquisition of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy and in the process of chemical carcinogenesis in the liver.",0

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of dutasteride (type 1 and 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) with finasteride (type 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) and placebo in men with androgenetic alopecia. METHODS: Men aged 20 to 50 years with androgenetic alopecia were randomized to receive dutasteride (0.02, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/d), finasteride (1 mg/d), or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was hair count (2.54-cm diameter) at week 24. Other assessments included hair count (1.13-cm diameter) and width, photographic assessments (investigators and panel), change in stage, and health outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 917 men were randomized. Hair count and width increased dose dependently with dutasteride. Dutasteride 0.5 mg significantly increased hair count and width in a 2.54-cm diameter and improved hair growth (frontal view; panel photographic assessment) at week 24 compared with finasteride (P�= .003, P�= .004, and P�= .002, respectively) and placebo (all P < .001). The number and severity of adverse events were similar among treatment groups. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited to 24 weeks.

427,22386736,Optimising outcome on thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease by co-prescription of allopurinol,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine remain first line immunomodulatory treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. Toxicity and non-response are significant issues. Co-prescription of allopurinol with reduced-dose (25-33%) azathioprine or mercaptopurine may overcome these problems. We present the outcome of co-prescription in a large single-centre cohort. METHOD: Patients on thiopurine/allopurinol co-prescription were identified. Indication for and outcome on combination treatment were established. Blood parameters and metabolite results were compared on single agent and combination treatment. Toxicity associated with combination treatment was sought. RESULTS: 110 patients on combination treatment were identified. Clinical remission was achieved in 60/79 (76%) of patients in whom the effect of thiopurine could be studied in isolation. 20/25 patients with hepatotoxicity tolerated combination treatment and normalised their liver function tests. 24/28 patients with atypical side effects tolerated co-therapy. 13/20 non-responders responded to combination treatment. In patients started on combination treatment as first line therapy, 15/23 achieved clinical remission. Thioguanine nucleotides were significantly higher and methylated metabolites significantly lower on combination therapy. Mean cell volume was higher and total white cell and neutrophil counts lower on combination treatment. 13 adverse events occurred, including 6 specific to co-therapy (3 rash, 2 abnormal liver function tests, 1 dosing error). All were minor and self-limiting. CONCLUSION: This is the largest published experience of the use of allopurinol to optimise outcomes on thiopurine treatment. Combination therapy permitted successful treatment of a significant number of patients who would otherwise have been labelled as thiopurine failures. A few self-limiting side effects were encountered.",1
428,15286086,Pharmacological and clinical profile of moexipril: a concise review,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, with the exception of the rare occasion of angioedema. These drugs have demonstrated additional cardiovascular protective effects to their blood pressure lowering, and their combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide potentiates their antihypertensive effectiveness. Moexipril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor suitable for once-daily administration, and like some ACE inhibitors, moexipril is a prodrug and needs to be hydrolyzed in the liver into its active carboxylic metabolite, moexiprilat, to become effective. Moexipril alone and in combination with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in lowering blood pressure and be well tolerated and safe given in single daily doses. In this review, the pharmacological profile of this drug and its clinical usefulness are discussed.",1
429,24323277,Bench to cribside: the path for developing a neuroprotectant,"The consequences of perinatal brain injury include immeasurable anguish for families and substantial ongoing costs for care and support of effected children. Factors associated with perinatal brain injury in the preterm infant include inflammation and infection, and with increasing gestational age, a higher proportion is related to hypoxic-ischemic events, such as stroke and placental abruption. Over the past decade, we have acquired new insights in the mechanisms underpinning injury and many new tools to monitor outcome in perinatal brain injury in our experimental models. By embracing these new technologies, we can expedite the screening of novel therapies. This is critical as despite enormous efforts of the research community, hypothermia is the only viable neurotherapeutic, and this procedure is limited to term birth and postcardiac arrest hypoxic-ischemic events. Importantly, experimental and preliminary data in humans also indicate a considerable therapeutic potential for melatonin against perinatal brain injury. However, even if this suggested potential is proven, the complexity of the human condition means we are likely to need additional neuroprotective and regenerative strategies. Thus, within this review, we will outline what we consider the key stages of preclinical testing and development for a neuroprotectant or regenerative neurotherapy for perinatal brain injury. We will also highlight examples of novel small animal physiological and behavioral testing that gives small animal preclinical models greater clinical relevance. We hope these new tools and an integrated bench to cribside strategic plan will facilitate the fulfillment of our overarching goal, improving the long-term brain health and quality of life for infants suffering perinatal brain injury.

430,16837676,Effects of raloxifene on cardiovascular events and breast cancer in postmenopausal women,"""BACKGROUND: The effect of raloxifene, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, on coronary heart disease (CHD) and breast cancer is not established. METHODS: We randomly assigned 10,101 postmenopausal women (mean age, 67.5 years) with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD to 60 mg of raloxifene daily or placebo and followed them for a median of 5.6 years. The two primary outcomes were coronary events (i.e., death from coronary causes, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome) and invasive breast cancer. RESULTS: As compared with placebo, raloxifene had no significant effect on the risk of primary coronary events (533 vs. 553 events; hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.07), and it reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer (40 vs. 70 events; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.83; absolute risk reduction, 1.2 invasive breast cancers per 1000 women treated for one year); the benefit was primarily due to a reduced risk of estrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast cancers. There was no significant difference in the rates of death from any cause or total stroke according to group assignment, but raloxifene was associated with an increased risk of fatal stroke (59 vs. 39 events; hazard ratio, 1.49; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.24; absolute risk increase, 0.7 per 1000 woman-years) and venous thromboembolism (103 vs. 71 events; hazard ratio, 1.44; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.95; absolute risk increase, 1.2 per 1000 woman-years). Raloxifene reduced the risk of clinical vertebral fractures (64 vs. 97 events; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.89; absolute risk reduction, 1.3 per 1000). CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene did not significantly affect the risk of CHD. The benefits of raloxifene in reducing the risks of invasive breast cancer and vertebral fracture should be weighed against the increased risks of venous thromboembolism and fatal stroke.

431,20006208,Bajiaolian poisoning-a poisoning with high misdiagnostic rate,"BACKGROUND: One of the oldest Chinese herbal medicine, bajiaolian is widely used in traditional therapy. In Taiwan, bajiaolian is the fifth highest cause of poisoning among herbal medicines. The diagnosis is difficult because physicians are unfamiliar with this medicine's multiple presentations in different stages of intoxication. PROCEDURES: The records of 4 major poison centers in Taiwan were searched for all bajiaolian intoxication from July 1985 (the opening of first poison center) to March 2003. Two emergency physicians with toxicologic training reviewed the admission charts and visited case patients for follow-up. FINDINGS: Seventeen patients were identified, of which 15 (88.2%) had been misdiagnosed initially. In the beginning of their medical care, 14 cases were diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis. CONCLUSION: Bajiaolian intoxication is probably misdiagnosed because of early gastrointestinal symptoms followed by neurologic symptoms. A detailed patient history should be taken, and symptoms should be reviewed systemically to improve diagnostic accuracy.",1
432,11374701,Jaundice and hepatocellular damage associated with nevirapine therapy,"OBJECTIVE: Nevirapine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor that is used as part of highly active antiretroviral therapeutic combinations. Nevirapine has been associated with a skin rash in 32 to 48% of patients. Recent reports indicate that hepatic toxicity also occurs. METHODS: We describe four instances of reversible hepatocellular damage associated with the use of nevirapine in patients with HIV infection. Two of the four patients were also coinfected with the hepatitis C virus. RESULTS: Evidence of malaise, skin rash, and icteric hepatitis with pruritus occurred 4-6 wk after the beginning of nevirapine therapy. No evidence of metabolic acidosis was present in any of our patients. In all cases, liver test results declined to normal or near normal levels, and pruritus disappeared 4-6 wk after discontinuation of the medication. No patient was rechallenged with the drug. CONCLUSION: Nevirapine can be associated with icteric hepatitis, which appears to be reversible after withdrawal of the drug.",1
433,2699787,Short term effects of ketoconazole in Cushing's syndrome],"The effects of Ketoconazole (600 mg/day) were evaluated in 10 patients with Cushing's syndrome during a mean period of 4.5 weeks (range 1-12). The urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) decreased by 21 +/- 15% (mean +/- SEM) (p less than 0.01) on day 1; 54 +/- 8% (p less than 0.0001) on day 2; 60 +/- 15% (p less than 0.0001) on day 3 and 87 +/- 3% (p less than 0.0001) on day 8 compared to baseline. Salivary cortisol at 0800 h decreased similarly. On day 3, 7 patients showed normal UFC values and on day 8, only 1 patient, with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, had persistent hypercortisolism. The cortisol decrease was associated with an increase in desoxycorticosterone values (p less than 0.01) and a decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (p less than 0.001), delta 4 androstenedione (p less than 0.05) and testosterone (p less than 0.05). No significant variations were observed in ACTH, 11 desoxycortisol, aldosterone, plasma renin activity, corticosteroid-binding globulin and sex hormone-binding globulin. Side effects were few: mild clinical adrenal insufficiency (n = 5), oedema (n = 3) and reversible hepatic toxicity (n = 1). We conclude that Ketoconazole is an effective inhibitor of cortisol and androgens synthesis. It is well tolerated, rapidly effective and its efficacy persists unchanged for at least one month in all forms of Cushing's syndromes. For these reasons Ketoconazole may be a valuable drug for preoperative treatment of Cushing's syndrome. ",0
434,9815810,Phase IB trial of chimeric antidisialoganglioside antibody plus interleukin 2 for melanoma patients,"We conducted a Phase IB trial of antidisialoganglioside chimeric 14. 18 (ch14.18) antibody and interleukin 2 (IL-2) to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), immunological effects, antitumor effects, and toxicity of this treatment combination. Twenty-four melanoma patients received immunotherapy with ch14.18 antibody and a continuous infusion of Roche IL-2 (1.5 x 10(6) units/m2/day) given 4 days/week for 3 weeks. The ch14.18 antibody (dose level, 2-10 mg/m2/day) was scheduled to be given for 5 days, before, during, or following initial systemic IL-2 treatment. The ch14.18 MTD was 7.5 mg/m2/day, and 15 patients were treated with the ch14.18 MTD. Immunological effects included the induction of lymphokine-activated killer activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, serum samples obtained following ch14.18 infusions were able to facilitate in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Antitumor activity included one complete response, one partial response, eight patients with stable disease, and one patient with >50% decrease of hepatic metastases in the face of recurrence of a s.c. lesion. Dose-limiting toxicities were a severe allergic reaction and weakness, pericardial effusion, and decreased performance status. Most patients treated at the MTD had abdominal, chest, or extremity pain requiring i.v. morphine. One patient had an objective peripheral neuropathy. This IL-2 and ch14.18 treatment combination induces immune activation in all patients and antitumor activity in some melanoma patients. We are attempting to enhance this treatment approach by addition of the anti-GD3 R24 antibody to this IL-2 and ch14.18 regimen.",1
435,18223307,Measurement of renal tissue oxygen tension: systematic differences between fluorescence optode and microelectrode recordings in anaesthetized rabbits,"The validity of fluorescence optodes for measurement of renal cortical tissue oxygen tension was tested by comparison with Clark electrodes. We varied renal blood flow and inspired O2 content in anaesthetized rabbits while simultaneously measuring cortical tissue oxygen tension. Cortical oxygen tension varied with inspired O2 content. Fluorescence optode measurements were more tightly distributed than those from a Clark electrode. Cumulative frequency distributions for fluorescence optodes were shifted to the left of those for Clark electrodes. The slope of the relationship between oxygen tension in arterial blood and cortical tissue was less for the fluorescence optode than the Clark electrode. Cortical tissue oxygen tension measurements by these two methods were correlated (r(2) = 0.32; p < 0.001), with no fixed bias but considerable proportional bias. Thus, the slope of the relationship between the two measurements was less than unity (0.57 [0.50-0.69]). Cortical oxygen tension values from fluorescence optodes are less variable but proportionally less than those from Clark electrodes. Theoretical considerations suggest that true interstitial oxygen tension lies somewhere between values provided by the two techniques. Nevertheless, the lesser variability of the fluorescence optode technique may aid detection of physiologically significant changes in intrarenal oxygenation. ",0
436,2113424,The high incidence of valproate hepatotoxicity in infants may relate to familial metabolic defects,"The incidence of fatal hepatic failure associated with valproic acid (VPA) therapy is highest in children under the age of three years, particularly in those with developmental delay. The pathogenesis of VPA hepatotoxicity is unclear but may relate to the accumulation of a toxic metabolite of VPA which impairs fatty-acid oxidation. We describe two unrelated infants with developmental delay who developed hepatic failure while receiving VPA. Siblings of both children subsequently developed hepatic steatosis and intractable seizures without being exposed to VPA. This suggests that the two children who developed liver failure when receiving VPA may have had a familial metabolic disorder. Familial metabolic disorders may account partly for the higher incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity described in infants receiving VPA.",1

We monitored the safety of mirtazapine as reported in primary practice in England. The exposure data were provided by monitoring the dispensed prescriptions issued between September 1997 and February 1999. Questionnaires sent to GPs provided outcome data. Drowsiness/sedation and malaise/lassitude were the most frequent ADRs (116, 71 respectively) and had the highest incidence density (per 1000 patient-months) in the first month of treatment (58.1, 27.8 respectively). Agitation (73), aggression (70), rash (20), hallucinations (13) and abnormal dreams (31 were unlabelled AES while abnormal liver function tests (12), syncope (8), abnormal behaviour (4) and visual disturbance (3) were labelled AES possibly due to mirtazapine use.

438,19293743,Willingness of health care personnel to work in a disaster: an integrative review of the literature,"Effective hospital surge response in disaster depends largely on an adequate number of personnel to provide care. Studies appearing since 1991 indicate health care personnel may not be willing to work in all disaster situations-and if so, this could degrade surge response. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the state of the evidence concerning the willingness of health care personnel to work in disaster. The aims of this review are to collate and assess the literature concerning willingness of health care personnel to work during a disaster, to identify gaps in the literature as areas for future investigation, and to facilitate evidence-based disaster planning. Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (25 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies). The current evidence indicates there may be certain factors related to willingness to work (or lack of willingness) in disaster including the type of disaster, concern for family, and concerns about personal safety. Barriers to willingness to work have been identified including pet care needs and the lack of personal protective equipment. This review describes the state of an emerging area of science. These findings have significant implications for community and organizational emergency planning and policymaking in an environment defined by limited resources. ",0
439,20304628,Phase II trial of the histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat in women with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer and micropapillary (LMP) ovarian tumours,"AIM: Micropapillary/borderline (LMP) ovarian tumours are rarely included in clinical trials and are intrinsically resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a poor prognosis. The histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat demonstrated antitumour activity in pre-clinical ovarian cancer models. METHODS: A phase II study was performed to evaluate the activity of belinostat in two patient populations: women with metastatic or recurrent platinum resistant (progression within 6 months) EOC and LMP ovarian tumours, both groups had received no more than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. Belinostat 1000 mg/m(2)/d was administered iv days 1-5 of a 21 d cycle. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumour biopsies, where possible, for correlative studies were obtained prior to and following treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with EOC and 14 patients with LMP tumours were enrolled on study. Belinostat was well tolerated with no grade four toxicity (179 cycles). Grade 3 toxicity consisted of thrombosis (3 patients), hypersensitivity (1) and elevated ALP (1). One patient with LMP tumour had a partial response (unconfirmed) and 10 had stable disease (SD), 3 were non-evaluable. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.6--not reached). Best response in patients with EOC was SD (nine patients) and median PFS was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.2-5.7 months). An accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 was noted in PBMCs and in tumour tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Belinostat is well tolerated in both patient groups and shows some activity in patients with micropapillary (LMP) disease.",1
440,17900246,Anabolic-androgenic steroids and liver injury,"Athletes and nonathletes have been using anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) for a long time, in an inadequate and unsurveilled manner, with the aim of improving sports performance or for cosmetic purposes. AAS consumption is becoming more widespread and involving younger people, and there is a trend for self-administration of higher doses and for combining AAS with other potentially harmful drugs. Almost any subject abusing AAS will experience adverse effects. Therefore, adverse effects from these exposures, including liver toxicity, are expected to increase in the years to come. The present manuscript describes a representative case of intrahepatic cholestasis with the intention to discuss AAS-related liver toxicity (including the potential therapeutic role of ursodeoxycholic acid) and to comment on several aspects of the clinical scenario the gastroenterologist should be aware of.",1
441,15659724,Effects of moderate alcohol consumption on cognitive function in women,"BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of excess alcohol intake on cognitive function are well established, but the effect of moderate consumption is uncertain. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2001, we evaluated cognitive function in 12,480 participants in the Nurses' Health Study who were 70 to 81 years old, with follow-up assessments in 11,102 two years later. The level of alcohol consumption was ascertained regularly beginning in 1980. We calculated multivariate-adjusted mean cognitive scores and multivariate-adjusted risks of cognitive impairment (defined as the lowest 10 percent of the scores) and a substantial decline in cognitive function over time (defined as a change that was in the worst 10 percent of the distribution of the decline). We also stratified analyses according to the apolipoprotein E genotype in a subgroup of women. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, moderate drinkers (those who consumed less than 15.0 g of alcohol per day [about one drink]) had better mean cognitive scores than nondrinkers. Among moderate drinkers, as compared with nondrinkers, the relative risk of impairment was 0.77 on our test of general cognition (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.88) and 0.81 on the basis of a global cognitive score combining the results of all tests (95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.93). The results for cognitive decline were similar; for example, on our test of general cognition, the relative risk of a substantial decline in performance over a two-year period was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98) among moderate drinkers, as compared with nondrinkers. There were no significant associations between higher levels of drinking (15.0 to 30.0 g per day) and the risk of cognitive impairment or decline. There were no significant differences in risks according to the beverage (e.g., wine or beer) and no interaction with the apolipoprotein E genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in women, up to one drink per day does not impair cognitive function and may actually decrease the risk of cognitive decline.",0

443,16175516,Randomized clinical trial of postoperative fondaparinux versus perioperative dalteparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in high-risk abdominal surgery,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess whether the synthetic factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism more efficiently than the low molecular weight heparin dalteparin in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. METHODS: In a double-blind double-dummy randomized study, patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia received once-daily subcutaneous injections of fondaparinux 2.5 mg or dalteparin 5000 units for 5-9 days. Fondaparinux was started 6 h after surgery. The first two doses of dalteparin, 2500 units each, were given 2 h before surgery and 12 h after the preoperative administration. The primary outcome measure was a composite of deep vein thrombosis detected by bilateral venography and symptomatic, confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism up until day 10. The main safety outcome measure was major bleeding during treatment. RESULTS: Among 2048 patients evaluable for efficacy, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 4.6 per cent (47 of 1027) with fondaparinux compared with 6.1 per cent (62 of 1021) with dalteparin, a relative risk reduction of 24.6 (95 per cent confidence interval -9.0 to 47.9) per cent (P = 0.144), which met the predetermined criterion for non-inferiority of fondaparinux. Major bleeding was observed in 49 (3.4 per cent) of 1433 patients given fondaparinux and 34 (2.4 per cent) of 1425 given dalteparin (P = 0.122). CONCLUSION: Postoperative fondaparinux was at least as effective as perioperative dalteparin in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery.",1

AIM: To evaluate the benefit of combination therapy with adefovir and lamivudine versus adefovir alone in maintaining virological, biochemical and histological responses. METHODS: Patients with chronic hepatitis B with and without previous lamivudine therapy were randomised to receive adefovir alone (10 mg/daily) or adefovir and lamivudine (100 mg/daily) for up to 192 weeks. Study endpoints were (i) maintained virological (HBV DNA <500 copies/mL), biochemical and histological response, (ii) loss of HBeAg and (iii) loss of HBsAg. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were enrolled, including 31 HBeAg -positive and 31 treatment-naive subjects. 30 patients remained on assigned therapy at 192 weeks. The percentage of patients achieving a combined maintained response was higher in the combination than the monotherapy arm, both at week 48 (59% vs. 26%, P = 0.06) and 192 (68% vs. 31%, P = 0.03). At week 192, 76% of the combination vs. 36% of the monotherapy group had loss of HBeAg (P = 0.03). One patient receiving adefovir cleared HBsAg. Adefovir resistance developed in 6 of 19 (32%) monotherapy but none of 22 combination treated patients (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Extended combination therapy with lamivudine and adefovir is associated with a high rate of long-term virological and biochemical response. Adefovir monotherapy appears to be less effective mainly because of poor initial response and the ultimate development of antiviral resistance (www.Clinical. Trials.gov NCT00023309).",1
448,24986165,"""""""We have become doctors for ourselves"""": motives for malaria self-care among adults in southeastern Tanzania""","Prompt and appropriate treatment of malaria with effective medicines remains necessary if malaria control goals are to be achieved. The theoretical concepts from self-care and the health belief model were used to examine the motivations for malaria self-care among the adult population. A qualitative study was conducted through eight focus group discussions with adult community members to explore their general opinions, views and perceptions of malaria and of its treatments. These groups were followed by 15 in-depth interviews of participants with a recent malaria experience to allow for an in-depth exploration of their self-care practices. The analysis followed principles of grounded theory and was conducted using Nvivo 9 qualitative data management software. The self-treatment of malaria at home was found to be a common practice among the study participants. The majority of the participants practiced self-medication with a painkiller as an initial response. The persistence and the worsening of the disease symptoms prompted participants to consider other self-care options. Perceptions that many malaria symptoms are suggestive of other conditions motivated participants to self-refer for malaria test. The accessibility of private laboratory facilities and drug shops motivated their use for malaria tests and for obtaining anti-malarial medicines, respectively. Self-treatment with anti-malarial monotherapy was common, motivated by their perceived effectiveness and availability. The perceived barriers to using the recommended combination treatment, artemether-lumefantrine, were related to the possible side-effects and to uncertainty about their effectiveness, and these doubts motivated some participants to consider self-medication with local herbs. Several factors were mentioned as motivating people for self-care practices. These included poor patient provider relationship, unavailability of medicine and the costs associated with accessing treatments from the health facilities. Malaria self-care and self-treatment with anti-malarial monotherapy are common among adults, and are motivated by both individual characteristics and the limitations of the existing health care facilities. There is a need for public health interventions to take into account community perceptions and cultural schemas on malaria self-care practices. ",0
449,9098664,"Fosfomycin tromethamine. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy as a single-dose oral treatment for acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections","Fosfomycin tromethamine is a phosphonic acid bactericidal agent with in vitro activity against most urinary tract pathogens. It is particularly active against Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterococcus spp. There appears to be little cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other antibacterial agents, possibly because it differs from other agents in its general chemical structure and site of action. In its new formulation as the oral tromethamine salt, fosfomycin has 34 to 41% oral bioavailability, has a mean elimination half-life of 5.7 hours, and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Following a single 3 g oral dose, peak urinary concentrations occur within 4 hours and remain high (> 128 mg/L) for 24 to 48 hours, which is sufficient to inhibit most urinary tract pathogens. In clinical trials in patients with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection, single-dose fosfomycin tromethamine therapy was effective, and comparable with several other antibacterial agents given either as single-dose or multiple-dose treatments [e.g. beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone agents, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), nitrofurantoin and pipemidic acid]. Bacteriological eradication rates of 75 to 90% were achieved 5 to 11 days after therapy, with eradication rates of 62 to 93% 4 to 6 weeks after therapy. In 3 large double-blind comparisons with ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole and nitrofurantoin, 99% of fosfomycin tromethamine recipients and 100% of patients receiving comparator agents were considered clinically cured or improved after therapy. Fosfomycin tromethamine is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. These comprise mainly gastrointestinal symptoms that are transient, mild and self-limiting. Thus, fosfomycin tromethamine achieves high clinical and bacteriological cure rates in patients with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection and is well tolerated. The single-dose administration regimen and favourable US pregnancy category rating of fosfomycin tromethamine should also encourage its use in this indication.",1
450,19281586,Survey of surgical skills of RANZCOG trainees,"In Australia, the Integrated Training Program (ITP) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) offers training in obstetrics and gynaecology. There is anecdotal concern among trainees and Fellows that the surgical component of training is inadequate, with new specialists lacking the confidence and competence to perform many 'standard' surgical procedures. These concerns have not previously been quantified in Australia and New Zealand. To determine trainees' subjective competence and confidence with surgical procedures and trainees' satisfaction with their surgical training. All 430 active RANZCOG trainees and 108 Fellows elevated within the previous two years were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire (65% response rate), which assessed details of procedures performed and confidence to perform them; satisfaction with the surgical training; and perceived teaching ability of the supervising consultants. Those in ITP year 6 rated their confidence high (>or= 4 of 5) for procedures performed very frequently, but lower for other procedures. No procedure regarding the management of complications reached a confidence score of >or= 4. Teaching abilities were rated best for obstetric procedures, with 54% rating their consultants' teaching ability as 'excellent'; but for laparoscopic procedures and procedures dealing with complications, 21.2% and 23.4% of respondents rated their consultants' teaching ability as 'poor', respectively. Advanced trainees lacked confidence in a range of surgical procedures; and possible weaker areas were identified in the teaching experience of trainers.

Male Wistar rats were fed purified diets containing casein, soy protein, or egg yolk protein for 14 d. The apparent absorptions of calcium, magnesium, and iron in the rats fed the yolk protein-based diet were lower than those in rats fed the casein- and soy protein-based diets. The apparent phosphorus absorption and the apparent protein digestibility in the yolk protein group were lower than those in the casein and soy protein groups. In the feces of the yolk protein group, serine comprised more than 30% of the amino acids. The addition of egg yolk phosvitin to the casein diets at levels of 1% and 2% (w/w) produced effects on calcium and magnesium absorptions similar to those produced by the diet containing yolk protein. The tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) pattern suggested that phosphopeptide fragments having molecular masses of 28, 22, and 15 kDa were evident in the contents of the small intestine of the rats fed phosvitin diets. These results indicate that yolk protein, when compared with casein and soy protein, decreases calcium and magnesium absorption via the resistance of phosvitin to proteolytic action. ",0
452,26324049,Bivalirudin or Unfractionated Heparin in Acute Coronary Syndromes,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting evidence exists on the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin administered as part of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: We randomly assigned 7213 patients with an acute coronary syndrome for whom PCI was anticipated to receive either bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin. Patients in the bivalirudin group were subsequently randomly assigned to receive or not to receive a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion. Primary outcomes for the comparison between bivalirudin and heparin were the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and net adverse clinical events (a composite of major bleeding or a major adverse cardiovascular event). The primary outcome for the comparison of a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion with no post-PCI infusion was a composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events. RESULTS: The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with heparin (10.3% and 10.9%, respectively; relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.09; P=0.44), nor was the rate of net adverse clinical events (11.2% and 12.4%, respectively; relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.03; P=0.12). Post-PCI bivalirudin infusion, as compared with no infusion, did not significantly decrease the rate of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events (11.0% and 11.9%, respectively; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an acute coronary syndrome, the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and net adverse clinical events were not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with unfractionated heparin. The rate of the composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events was not significantly lower with a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion than with no post-PCI infusion.

454,24330462,A system to simultaneously detect tick-borne pathogens based on the variability of the 16S ribosomal genes,"DNA microarrays can be used to quickly and sensitively identify several different pathogens in one step. Our previously developed DNA microarray, based on the detection of variable regions in the 16S rDNA gene (rrs), which are specific for each selected bacterial genus, allowed the concurrent detection of Borrelia spp., Anaplasma spp., Francisella spp., Rickettsia spp. and Coxiella spp. In this study, we developed a comprehensive detection system consisting of a second generation DNA microarray and quantitative PCRs. New oligonucleotide capture probes specific for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. genospecies and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis were included. This new DNA microarray system required substantial changes in solution composition, hybridization conditions and post-hybridization washes. This second generation chip displayed high specificity and sensitivity. The specificity of the capture probes was tested by hybridizing the DNA microarrays with Cy5-labeled, PCR-generated amplicons encoding the rrs genes of both target and non-target bacteria. The detection limit was determined to be 10(3) genome copies, which corresponds to 1-2 pg of DNA. A given sample was evaluated as positive if its mean fluorescence was at least 10% of the mean fluorescence of a positive control. Those samples with fluorescence close to the threshold were further analyzed using quantitative PCRs, developed to identify Francisella spp., Rickettsia spp. and Coxiella spp. Like the DNA microarray, the qPCRs were based on the genus specific variable regions of the rrs gene. No unspecific cross-reactions were detected. The detection limit for Francisella spp. was determined to be only 1 genome copy, for Coxiella spp. 10 copies, and for Rickettsia spp., 100 copies. Our detection system offers a rapid method for the comprehensive identification of tick-borne bacteria, which is applicable to clinical samples. It can also be used to identify both pathogenic and endosymbiontic bacteria in ticks for eco-epidemiological studies, tick laboratory colony testing, and many other applications. ",0
455,1454086,Sympathetic overactivity in patients with chronic renal failure,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a frequent complication of chronic renal failure, but its causes are not fully understood. There is indirect evidence that increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system might contribute to hypertension in patients with end-stage renal disease, but sympathetic-nerve discharge has not been measured directly in patients or animals with chronic renal failure. METHODS: We recorded the rate of postganglionic sympathetic-nerve discharge to the blood vessels in skeletal muscle by means of microelectrodes inserted into the peroneal nerve in 18 patients with native kidneys who were undergoing long-term treatment with hemodialysis (of whom 14 had hypertension), 5 patients receiving hemodialysis who had undergone bilateral nephrectomy (of whom 1 had hypertension), and 11 normal subjects. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SE) rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge was 2.5 times higher in the patients receiving hemodialysis who had not undergone nephrectomy than in the normal subjects (58 +/- 3 vs. 23 +/- 3 bursts per minute, P < 0.01). In contrast, the rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge was similar in the patients receiving hemodialysis who had undergone bilateral nephrectomy (21 +/- 6 bursts per minute) and the normal subjects. The rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge in the patients receiving hemodialysis who had not undergone nephrectomy was also significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that in the patients with bilateral nephrectomy, and it was accompanied in the former group by higher values for vascular resistance in the calf (45 +/- 4 vs. 22 +/- 4 units, P < 0.05) and mean arterial pressure (106 +/- 4 vs. 76 +/- 14 mm Hg, P < 0.05). The rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge was not correlated with either plasma norepinephrine concentrations or plasma renin activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic renal failure may be accompanied by reversible sympathetic activation, which appears to be mediated by an afferent signal arising in the failing kidneys.",0
456,7810402,Influence of management technology and parturition on antibody levels in cows with bovine leukosis,"Sera from 97 Holstein-Friesian cows kept in isolation (herd I) were tested on 9 occasions with an interval of 90 days. The cows had previously given a positive reaction with bovine leukaemia virus antigen in the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. During the period of loose housing (at tests 1-3) 0-3 cows per test (0-3.1%) gave a negative reaction. When the same animals were kept in the tie-in system (at tests 4-7) the number of negative reactors varied between 9 and 26 (16.9-20.1%). Twenty-eight cows of herd II were tested serologically by the AGID test on a total of 9 occasions from day 60 before term up to postpartum day 90. The lowest antibody level was obtained at calving, when 7 cows gave a negative result in the AGID test. In three cows the decline of antibody level was so pronounced that their serum was negative even after postpartum day 60. One cow was negative even at the end of the test period (on postpartum day 90). The variation in serum antibody level was demonstrable also by ELISA; however, by that test none of the animals gave a negative result. The antibody level demonstrable in the milk reached its peak at calving and then it underwent a gradual decline; however, it did not drop below the detectability limit by the end of the test period. It is concluded that in bovine leukosis infected herds the performance of the AGID test is extremely impaired by the use of the tie-in housing system, as well as by a combined effect of tying in and parturition. Therefore, during the leukosis eradication and qualification of herds kept in a tie-in system, ELISA is the method that can be used, instead of AGID, with satisfactory efficacy even for the testing of sera.

Case report and review article. Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, 1st Medical Faculty of the Charles University and General Faculty Hospital, Prague. Pregnancies and deliveries after the transplantation of solid organs are not common. Mostly there are experiences with women after kidney transplantation, smaller or no experiences are with women after transplantation of other solid organs. About 25 pancreas transplantation per year are performed in the Czech republic. Two women after the combined kidney and pancreas transplantation were the first in Czech republic to get pregnant spontaneously and delivered by using a chronic immunosupressive. therapy (Prograf, Imuran, Prednison) in 2002 and 2003. These single pregnancies were led as a high-risk pregnancy in Regional Perinatology Center in collaboration with Transplant and Diabetic Center. Both pregnancies were termined from the obstetrical indication before the term by cesarean section. Both children were healthy. The pregnancy of both patients has not affected the function of the transplanted organs and development of both children has been normal. ",0
458,18484783,Safety of the nonselective NSAID nabumetone : focus on gastrointestinal tolerability,"""Although effective in the treatment of pain associated with rheumatic conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, long-term use of NSAIDs is primarily limited by their association with upper gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Adverse effects range from dyspepsia and abdominal pain to ulceration and bleeding. GI damage elicited by NSAIDs arises as the result of biochemically induced topical irritant effects and by topical and systemic pharmacological suppression of gastroprotective prostaglandins. Variation in the physicochemical properties and pharmacological profiles among the individual NSAIDs translate into inter-agent differences regarding propensity to cause adverse GI effects. Nabumetone is a nonselective NSAID that offers distinct advantages over other agents in this class with regard to GI tolerability. Its non-acidic nature and pro-drug formulation, together with the lack of biliary secretion of its active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, are thought to contribute to the improved GI tolerability of this drug. In head-to-head trials with other NSAIDs, nabumetone has demonstrated significant benefits regarding the incidence of GI events and more serious perforations, ulcers and bleeds (PUBs). Pooled data from eight postmarketing, randomized, controlled trials demonstrated a lower cumulative frequency of PUBs with nabumetone (0.03%; 95% CI 0.0, 0.08) versus comparator NSAIDs (1.4%; 95% CI 0.5, 2.4). Large-scale database studies also indicate that risk of serious GI complications is lower with nabumetone than comparator NSAIDs. Limited comparative data suggest that nabumetone offers a GI tolerability profile similar to that of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (coxibs). Although adverse cardiovascular outcomes appear to be a class effect of the coxibs, conventional NSAIDs may also have the potential for causing atherothrombotic complications. However, based on available data, nabumetone does not appear to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Finally, there is no particular concern about the nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic potential of nabumetone. Nonetheless, the potential for adverse drug reactions remains, and hence nabumetone, as with any NSAID, should be used at the lowest dose, which is effective for each patient, and for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.""",1
459,29891151,Using process net-map to analyse governance challenges: A case study of livestock vaccination campaigns in Zambia,"The outbreak of livestock diseases in Sub-Saharan African countries is the most critical challenge affecting the development potential of the livestock sector. Vaccination campaigns are one of the most important strategies to deal with this challenge. However, such campaigns are difficult to implement due to major governance challenges, such as delays in the procurement of vaccines and the disbursement of funds. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of these governance challenges, based on a case study of a Livestock Development Animal Health Project in Zambia. The goal was to examine in detail why these problems occur and how they are linked to the implementation procedure. A novel qualitative research tool called Process Net-Map, which is a visual participatory mapping technique was applied. The tool made it possible to develop an understanding of the exact implementation mechanism and to identify the different actors involved, including government officials, private sector companies, and farmers. The study revealed that the complex design of the procurement procedure, the limited capacity of the procuring entity, and a lack of urgency among the actors involved, resulted in the procurement delays. The findings also indicate that the delay in the release of funds arises because of a diversion of funds. Some strategies to improve the efficiency of the procurement process were identified, such as increasing the sense of urgency, building staff capacity, using e-procurement and entering into framework contracts with suppliers. Building sustainable financial capacity in the overall management of public funds seems essential to deal with the challenge of fund diversion. Use of Citizen Report Cards and lobbying political decision markers are some of the mechanisms that farmers can employ to increase their capacity to hold the animal health service providers accountable and demand better services. The problems identified are not only relevant for vaccination programs but are general implementation challenges encountered in developmental programs that involve the distribution of publicly procured inputs.

460,29900943,Association Between Joint Hypermobility and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: An Observational Analytical Cross Sectional Study,"This study aims to assess the association between joint hypermobility (JHM) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This cross sectional study included 100 consecutive Iraqi patients (43 males, 57 females; mean age 30±6.6 years; range 18 to 40 years) with GERD diagnosed by a gastroenterologist according to the guidelines for diagnosis and management of GERD and age and sex matched 100 healthy controls (36 males, 64 females; mean age 30±5.2 years; range 20 to 40 years). JHM was measured using Beighton score method by a blinded observer. A score of 4 or more was considered hypermobile. Joint hypermobility values were significantly higher in GERD patients than in controls [46 (71.9%) vs 18 (28.1%), p<0.001, odds ratio=3.88; 95% confidence interval=2.04-7.39]. Multiple logistic regression analysis to detect predictors of GERD in JHM patients revealed that patients with high total mobility score (7- 9) had the highest risk for developing GERD [about 41 fold compared to those with normal mobility score (<4), P model <0.001, and overall prediction accuracy of 68%]. There is a significant association between JHM and GERD. The high total mobility score (7-9) was associated with a significantly high risk for developing GERD, indicating that early recognition of JHM may assist in early diagnosis and treatment of GERD.

461,21995388,Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant with influenza vaccine in young children,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines is known to be poor in infants and young children. METHODS: We studied the effect of the adjuvant MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion, on the efficacy of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 4707 healthy children 6 to less than 72 months of age who had not previously been vaccinated against influenza. The children were randomly assigned to three study groups, each of which received the assigned vaccines in two doses, 28 days apart, during two consecutive influenza seasons. Two of the groups were given age-appropriate doses of TIV either with or without the MF59 adjuvant, and the third group was given control (noninfluenza) vaccines to assess their absolute and relative efficacy against influenza-like illness, as confirmed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: Attack rates of influenza-like illness across both influenza seasons were 0.7%, 2.8%, and 4.7% in the adjuvant, nonadjuvant, and control vaccine groups, respectively. The absolute vaccine efficacy rates against all influenza strains (94 of 110 cases were due to vaccine-matched H3N2 viruses) were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to 93) for the MF59-adjuvant vaccine (ATIV) and 43% (95% CI, 15 to 61) for the vaccine without the adjuvant (TIV); the relative vaccine efficacy rate for ATIV versus TIV was 75% (95% CI, 55 to 87). The efficacy rates for ATIV were 79% (95% CI, 55 to 90) in children 6 to less than 36 months of age and 92% (95% CI, 77 to 97) in those 36 to less than 72 months of age, as compared with 40% (95% CI, -6 to 66) and 45% (95% CI, 6 to 68), respectively, for TIV. Antibody responses were higher with ATIV and remained so through day 181. The rates of systemic and local reactions to the influenza vaccines with and without the adjuvant were similar in the younger age group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09), but systemic events in the older age group were more frequent after administration of ATIV (63%) than after administration of TIV (44%) or the control vaccine (50%). Serious adverse events were distributed evenly across the three vaccine groups. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine with the MF59 adjuvant is efficacious against PCR-confirmed influenza in infants and young children.

462,2445154,Methotrexate hepatotoxicity and concentrations of methotrexate and folate in erythrocytes--relation to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis,"Assessment of folate and methotrexate concentrations in erythrocytes has been suggested as criterion for when to institute liver biopsy surveillance during methotrexate treatment of psoriasis. We report an investigation of these parameters in thirty psoriatics on long-term methotrexate treatment. The patients were six psoriatics with histologically verified methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis, eleven patients in which a blind histological evaluation had established a liver fibrosis in progression during treatment, and thirteen patients, who either had no liver fibrosis or no progression in the degree of fibrosis. There was no statistically significant difference in erythrocyte folate between the groups. When the two groups with progression were combined and compared with the group without progressive hepatic disease, erythrocyte methotrexate was found significantly higher in the patients with progression. Individual data, however, did not support the idea that assessment of folate and methotrexate in erythrocytes can limit the number of necessary liver biopsies during methotrexate treatment.",1
463,3027557,Evidence of an endogenous digitalis-like factor in the plasma of patients with acromegaly,"Evidence suggests that plasma-volume expansion leads to the release of a digitalis-like factor, which is thought to act on the renal tubular cells and cause natriuresis. We postulated that this factor might be present in patients with acromegaly (in whom plasma volume is elevated) and might return to normal levels when the disease was treated successfully. We measured the ability of plasma extracts from patients with acromegaly to inhibit the binding of ouabain to the sodium pump in normal red cells and to inhibit the enzymatic activity (sodium-potassium-ATPase) of the sodium pump in membrane preparations from normal kidneys. In 21 patients with active acromegaly, the mean (+/- SE) level of ouabain-binding inhibition (1.56 +/- 0.38) was higher (P less than 0.01) than that in either 11 successfully treated patients (0.18 +/- 0.05) or in 27 normal controls (0.19 +/- 0.03). The inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase activity by plasma was also greater in patients with active acromegaly (38.1 +/- 6.8 percent) than in successfully treated patients (18.4 +/- 5.6 percent, P less than 0.05) or controls (21.1 +/- 2.7 percent, P less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found between plasma volume and ouabain-binding inhibition in 23 patients (r = 0.72, P less than 0.01) and sodium-potassium-ATPase inhibition in 19 patients (r = 0.62, P less than 0.01). Pituitary adenomectomy decreased plasma volume and the inhibition by plasma of ouabain binding. We conclude that an endogenous digitalis-like factor is present in the plasma of patients with chronic volume expansion due to acromegaly. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this natriuretic factor may have a physiologic role in water and sodium homeostasis.",0

465,25683285,Safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel: expanded access in North America,"""BACKGROUND: The open-label, single-arm enzalutamide expanded access program (EAP) in the United States and Canada evaluated the safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had previously received docetaxel. METHODS: Patients (n?=?507) received enzalutamide 160?mg/day until disease progression, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or commercial availability occurred. AEs and other safety variables were assessed on day 1, weeks 4 and 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Data following transition to commercial drug were not collected. RESULTS: Median age was 71 years (range 43-97); 426 patients (83.9%) had a baseline ECOG score of ?1. In addition to docetaxel, the majority of patients had received prior prostate cancer treatments such as abiraterone (76.1%) or cabazitaxel (28.6%). Median study treatment duration was 2.6 months (range 0.03-9.07). The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation were commercial availability of enzalutamide (46.7%) and progressive disease (33.7%). A total of 88.2% of patients experienced AEs; 45.4% experienced AEs with a maximum grade of 1 or 2. Fatigue (39.1%), nausea (22.7%), and anorexia (14.8%) were the most commonly reported AEs. Seizure was reported in four patients (0.8%). The most commonly reported event leading to death was progression of metastatic prostate cancer (7.7%). CONCLUSION: In this heavily pretreated EAP population with progressive mCRPC, enzalutamide was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with that of the AFFIRM trial.""",1
466,31401122,Proteomics analysis of blood plasma in HIV-infected patients with chronic kidney disease,"Patients treated for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are prone to developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Current methods used in assessing kidney function suffer inaccuracy in HIV-infected patients. This study aims to identify biomarkers that could complement existing methods of kidney assessment among HIV-infected subjects. Plasma protein profiling was performed for HIV patients with CKD presented with negative/trace proteinuria (non-proteinuric) (n = 8) and their matched non-CKD controls, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE); selected protein candidates were identified using mass spectrometry. Subsequently, altered plasma abundance of protein candidates were verified using Western blotting in HIV-infected subjects with non-proteinuric CKD (n = 8), proteinuric CKD (n = 5), and their matched non-CKD controls, as well as in HIV-uninfected subjects with impaired kidney function (n = 3) and their matched controls. Analysis of 2DE found significantly altered abundance of five protein candidates between HIV-infected patients with non-proteinuric CKD and without CKD: alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M), serum albumin (ALB), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), haptoglobin (HP), and retinol binding protein (RBP4). Western blotting showed an increased abundance of A1M and HP in HIV-infected patients with non-proteinuric CKD compared to their non-CKD controls, whereas A1M, AZGP1, and RBP4 were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients with proteinuric CKD compared to their non-CKD controls. Such pattern was not found in HIV-uninfected subjects with impaired kidney function. The data suggests four proteins that may be used as biomarkers of CKD in HIV-infected patients. Further validation in a larger cohort of HIV-infected patients is necessary for assessing the clinical use of these proposed biomarkers for CKD. ",0

468,28089043,Contrasting microsatellite diversity in the evolutionary lineages of Phytophthora lateralis,"Following recent discovery of Phytophthora lateralis on native Chamaecyparis obtusa in Taiwan, four phenotypically distinct lineages were discriminated: the Taiwan J (TWJ) and Taiwan K (TWK) in Taiwan, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) in North America and Europe and the UK in west Scotland. Across the four lineages, we analysed 88 isolates from multiple sites for microsatellite diversity. Twenty-one multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were resolved with high levels of diversity of the TWK and PNW lineages. No alleles were shared between the PNW and the Taiwanese lineages. TWK was heterozygous at three loci, whereas TWJ isolates were homozygous apart from one isolate, which exhibited a unique allele also present in the TWK lineage. PNW lineage was heterozygous at three loci. The evidence suggests its origin may be a yet unknown Asian source. North American and European PNW isolates shared all their alleles and also a dominant MLG, consistent with a previous proposal that this lineage is a recent introduction into Europe from North America. The UK lineage was monomorphic and homozygous at all loci. It shared its alleles with the PNW and the TWJ and TWK lineages, hence a possible origin in a recent hybridisation event between a Taiwan lineage and PNW cannot be ruled out. ",0
469,12950418,Systematic review: hepatotoxic events associated with herbal medicinal products,"BACKGROUND: Large proportions of patients use herbal medicinal products, and encouraging data in terms of effectiveness exist for some of these. One aspect, however, which is still largely under-investigated is the question of potential harm. AIM: To review the recent evidence on hepatotoxic events associated with the use of herbal medicinal products. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed on Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Amed and Ciscom. To identify additional data, searches were conducted by hand in relevant medical journals and in our own files. The screening and selection of articles and the extraction of data were performed independently by the two authors. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. In order to be included articles were required to report data on hepatotoxic events associated with the therapeutic use of herbal medicinal products. RESULTS: Single medicinal herbs and combination preparations are associated with hepatotoxic events. Clinically, the spectrum ranges from transient elevations of liver enzyme levels to fulminant liver failure and death. In most instances hepatotoxic herbal constituents are believed to be the cause, while others may be due to herb-drug interactions, contamination and/or adulteration. CONCLUSIONS: A number of herbal medicinal products are associated with serious hepatotoxic events. Incidence figures are largely unknown, and in most cases a causal attribution is not established. The challenge for the future is to systematically research this area, educate all parties involved, and minimize patient risk.",1

Although imatinib is known to have a potential impact on various infectious organisms by altering the T-cell mediated immune response, only two cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during imatinib treatment have actually been reported. The role of liver transplantation (LT) after fatal HBV reactivation in patients with potentially treatable or curable hematologic malignancy is also unknown. Therefore, this report presents a case of fatal HBV reactivation during imatinib treatment for CML, where the patient is rescued by LT. Following a successful living donor LT, the liver function improves rapidly and the patient remains in complete cytogenetic remission after retreatment with imatinib for 6 months. The present report also covers the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in triggering HBV reactivation and a literature review of fulminant hepatic failure in CML patients taking imatinib.",1

473,1406792,The use of viral culture and p24 antigen testing to diagnose human immunodeficiency virus infection in neonates. The HIV Infection in Newborns French Collaborative Study Group,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants born to infected mothers is important for the infants' medical care, but the presence of maternal antibodies makes serologic tests uninformative. METHODS: In a cohort study of 181 infants born to HIV-infected mothers, we assessed the diagnostic value of HIV viral culture and testing for the presence of p24 antigen. The infants were tested at birth, again during the first 3 months, then followed and tested at the age of at least 18 months. RESULTS: Of the 181 infants, 3 died of HIV infection and 37 were seropositive after the age of 18 months. Viral cultures at birth were positive in 19 of the 40 infected infants and in none of the uninfected infants, yielding a sensitivity of 48 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 32 to 63 percent) and a specificity of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 97 to 100 percent). By the age of three months, 30 of the 40 infants (75 percent) had positive cultures; again, there were no false positive results among the infants who were tested a second time, of the 141 who remained uninfected. The sensitivity of testing for p24 antigen at birth was only 18 percent, with a specificity of 100 percent. The presence of p24 antigen at birth was associated with the development of early and severe HIV-related disease (P less than 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Viral culture at birth can correctly identify about half of newborns with HIV infection. The fact that this usually sensitive technique fails to identify about half the ultimately infected neonates suggests that vertical transmission of HIV may occur late in pregnancy or during delivery.",0
474,29178881,Atrial ERK1/2 activation in the embryo leads to incomplete Septal closure: a novel mouse model of atrial Septal defect,"MEK1 mutation and activated MAPK signaling has been found in patients with RASopathies and abnormal cardiac development. Previous studies have suggested that regulation of fetal MAPK signaling is essential for normal cardiac development. We investigated the effect of active MEK1 overexpression on fetal atrial septal development. An inducible double transgenic (DTg) mouse model was developed in which cardiac-specific fetal expression of a constitutively active form of human MEK1 (aMEK1) was induced primarily in the atrium via the withdrawal of doxycycline from the drinking water of pregnant mice. Atrial septal defect (ASD) was found in 51% (23/45) of DTg mice. Fifty-two percent (12/23) of ASD mice died before weaning, and surviving ASD mice exhibited hypertrophic hearts with enlarged right atria and decreased fractional shorting (40 ± 2% vs. 48 ± 0%, p < 0.05). The model mimicked human ASD in several key clinical features: severe ASD was associated with growth impairment; ASD-specific mortality was highest within the early postnatal period; despite an even distribution of ASD among the sexes, early mortality was significantly higher in males. The expression of aMEK1 and increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was documented via Western blot in DTg fetal hearts, with the largest increases seen in atrial tissue. In an alternative transgenic aMEK1 model with elevated atrial MKP3 expression and corresponding suppression of increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, animals did not develop ASD. This new model of ASD suggests that enhanced atrial MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling during fetal development disrupts normal atrial septation, possibly regulated by the balance of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. ",0

METHODS: A randomized, open-label, multicenter study comprised adults hospitalized with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of CAP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either (1) oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily (7-14 days); or (2) IV ceftriaxone 2 g once daily (1-7 days) followed by oral cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily (1-13 days) for a total of < or = 14 days. Patients receiving ceftriaxone/cefuroxime were allowed concomitant macrolide treatment. RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were randomized, of whom 341 received at least 1 dose of study medication (gemifloxacin, 169/172; ceftriaxone/cefuroxime, 172/173). Clinical success rates in the clinically evaluable (CE) population at follow-up (day 21-28 post-therapy), the primary end point, were 92.2% (107/116) for gemifloxacin and 93.4% (113/121) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference, -1.15; 95% CI, -7.73 to 5.43). In patients in Fine risk classes IV and V, the clinical success rate was 87.0% (20/23) for gemifloxacin versus 83.3% (20/24) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime. No difference in clinical response at follow-up was noted based on macrolide use. Bacteriologic success rates at follow-up in the bacteriologically evaluable (BE) population were 90.6% (58/64) for gemifloxacin and 87.3% (55/63) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference 3.32; 95% CI, -7.57 to 14.21). The clinical success rate in bacteremic patients at follow-up (BE population) was 100.0%. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. The frequency and types of adverse events were similar between the 2 groups. The most common treatment-related adverse events with gemifloxacin were diarrhea, liver-function adverse events, and rash; with ceftriaxone/cefuroxime, they were diarrhea, elevated hepatic-enzyme activity, and moniliasis. CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily were similar to those of IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefuroxime (with or without a macrolide) in the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe CAP. Both treatments were effective in bacteremic patients and those at increased risk of mortality.""",1
476,8292133,Administrative costs in U.S. hospitals,"BACKGROUND: Previous estimates of administrative costs in U.S. hospitals have been based on figures for California, and nationwide extrapolation has been controversial. If the costs of bureaucracy are high, major policy reforms may yield substantial savings. METHODS: We obtained detailed data on hospital expenses for fiscal year 1990 from reports submitted to Medicare by 6400 hospitals. We calculated each hospital's administrative costs by summing expenses in the following Medicare cost-accounting categories: administrative and general, nursing administration, central services and supply (excluding the purchase cost of supplies), medical records and library, utilization review, and the salary costs of the employee benefits department. We classified costs in most other categories as clinical. Some small categories of expenses (e.g., gift shop) were excluded from both our clinical and administrative groupings, and for others (e.g., plant operations), a proportional share was allocated between the two groupings. RESULTS: Nationwide, administration accounted for an average of 24.8 percent of each hospital's spending in fiscal 1990. Average hospital administrative costs ranged from 20.5 percent in Minnesota to 30.6 percent in Hawaii. Administrative salaries accounted for 22.4 percent of the average hospital's salary costs. Administrative costs were similar in states with high and low rates of enrollment in health maintenance organizations (HMOs). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital administrative costs in the United States are higher than previous estimates and more than twice as high as those in Canada. Greater enrollment in HMOs, with more competitive bidding by hospitals for managed-care contracts, an important element of proposed managed-competition health care reforms, does not seem to lower hospital administrative costs.",0
477,2927481,Impaired neurogenic and endothelium-mediated relaxation of penile smooth muscle from diabetic men with impotence,"Relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa of the penis is necessary for penile erection. To determine the relation of impaired relaxation to impotence in diabetic patients, we performed an in vitro examination of corpus cavernosum tissue obtained at the time of implantation of a penile prosthesis in 21 diabetic and 42 nondiabetic men with impotence. Contraction was induced in isolated strips of corporal smooth muscle by norepinephrine; then relaxation was assessed with electrical stimulation of autonomic nerves and with the administration of three agents: acetylcholine, which is known to be mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor; papaverine; and sodium nitroprusside. The latter two act directly on smooth muscle (i.e., they are endothelium-independent). Autonomically mediated relaxation with electrical stimulation was less pronounced in the smooth muscle from diabetic men (n = 18) than in the smooth muscle from nondiabetic men (n = 24; P = 0.001). The degree of impairment increased with the duration of diabetes (r = 0.61, P = 0.007). Endothelium-dependent relaxation was also impaired, as evidenced by a lower degree of muscle relaxation after the administration of acetylcholine in the tissue from diabetic men (n = 16) than in that from nondiabetic men (n = 22; P = 0.001). The adverse effects of diabetes persisted after we controlled for smoking and hypertension. Endothelium-independent relaxation after the administration of nitroprusside and papaverine was similar in tissue from the diabetic and nondiabetic men. We conclude that diabetic men with impotence have impairment in both the autonomic and the endothelium-dependent mechanisms that mediate the relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. These findings may provide a rationale for the treatment of diabetic men with impotence by intracavernosal injection of vasodilators to induce endothelium-independent relaxation of the smooth muscle.",0
478,985073,Is 80 years too old for aneurysmectomy?,"The records of 111 patients, 80 years of age or older, with a primary diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA) showed that 86 patients underwent aneurysm resection and grafting. Ruptured AAAs (n=30) were associated with an operative mortality of 74%. By contrast, AAA resection in the expanding aneurysm group (n=19) and in the elective surgery group (n=44) was associated with a 10% and 2% mortality, respectively. Thus, resection of a nonruptured AAA in 63 octogenarians was carried out with an overall mortality of 4.7%. While nearly half of the patients had cardiac disease detected preoperatively, the elective group demonstrated a low incidence of previous myocardial infarction (7%) and congestive heart failure (8%). Concomitantly, the incidence of myocardial infarction (6%) and congestive heart failure was relatively low after AAA resection. Significant postoperative oliguric azotemia was observed in only 5% of the nonruptured patients. Long-term survival was comparable to that of the general population over the age of 80 years. The quality of life enjoyed by these patients was not adversely affected by AAA resection. By contrast, 50% of patients treated conservatively died of ruptured AAA. Physiologic rather than chronologic age should determine selection for AAA resection in the octogenarian. ",0
479,18831033,Levetiracetam for seizures in children with brain tumors and other cancers,"""Children with brain tumors and other cancers can suffer from seizures. Unfortunately, most antiepileptic therapies are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Levetiracetam, a newer anticonvulsant, does not undergo CYP metabolism and does not alter the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy, antiemetics, and corticosteroids, which are metabolized by the liver. We studied 23 patients with cancer and seizures treated with levetiracetam. Over 95% of patients had fewer seizures, with 65.2% becoming seizure free; only one patient experienced an adverse reaction. Levetiracetam is effective and well tolerated in children with brain tumors and other cancers, who are often on multiple enzyme-inducing drugs.""",1
480,17993041,Evaluation of the safety of modafinil for treatment of excessive sleepiness,"""STUDY OBJECTIVES: Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent shown to improve wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) associated with shift work sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, or narcolepsy. Safety and tolerability data from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were combined to evaluate modafinil across these different patient populations. METHODS: One thousand five hundred twenty-nine outpatients received modafinil 200, 300, or 400 mg or placebo once daily for up to 12 weeks. Assessments included recording of adverse events and effects of modafinil on blood pressure/heart rate, electrocardiogram intervals, polysomnography, and clinical laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-three patients with shift work sleep disorder, 292 with obstructive sleep apnea, and 369 with narcolepsy received modafinil; 567 received placebo. Modafinil was well tolerated versus placebo, with headache (34% vs 23%, respectively), nausea (11% vs 3%), and infection (10% vs 12%) the most common adverse events. Adverse events were similar across all patient groups. Twenty-seven serious adverse events were reported (modafinil, n = 18; placebo, n = 9). In modafinil-treated patients, clinically significant increases in diastolic or systolic blood pressure were infrequent (n = 9 and n = 1, respectively, < 1% of patients). In the studies, 1 patient in the modafinil group and 1 in the placebo group had a clinically significant increase in heart rate. New clinically meaningful electrocardiogram abnormalities were rare with modafinil (n = 2) and placebo (n = 4). Clinically significant abnormalities in mean laboratory parameters were observed in fewer than 1% of modafinil-treated patients at final visit. Modafinil did not affect sleep architecture in any patient population according to polysomnography. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil is well tolerated in the treatment of excessive sleepiness associated with disorders of sleep and wakefulness and does not affect cardiovascular or sleep parameters.""",1
481,2925160,"D-glucaro-1,4-lactone: its excretion in the bile and urine and effect on the biliary secretion of beta-glucuronidase after oral administration in rats","This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that orally administered D-glucaro-1,4-lactone might be excreted in the bile and thus suppress the activity of biliary beta-glucuronidase, which is believed to play a key role in the development of pigment gallstones. D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone, 50 to 2,600 mu moles, was fed to adult Sprague-Dawley rats which had a bile fistula and were kept in metabolic cages for bile and urine collection. A total of 21 feeding experiments were carried out. Quantitation of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and total D-glucaric acid as the sum of D-glucaric acid and its lactones in the bile and urine involved extraction of bile with tetrahexylammonium chloride, adjustment of pH, boiling and determination of percentage inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity. The maximal velocity of beta-glucuronidase in the bile was also determined by the enzyme kinetic method. The results showed that 11% of administered D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was excreted in the urine and only 0.2% in the bile, with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone accounting for 20% of the total excreted D-glucaric acid. The concentration and excretory rate of total D-glucaric acid and D-glucaro-1,4-lactone in the urine, but not in the bile, were proportional to the amount of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone fed. The mean concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone in the bile after feeding was 0.06 mM, which was capable of suppression of 75% of beta-glucuronidase activity. Oral administration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone decreased biliary beta-glucuronidase concentration, slowed bile flow rate and hence decreased biliary beta-glucuronidase secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

Three different subcellular fractions, from rat liver, containing caveolin-1, the structural protein of caveolae, were morphologically and biochemically characterized. A caveolae-enriched plasma membrane fraction (CEF), contains large membrane structures surrounding attached internal plasmalemmal vesicles; the receptor-recycling compartment (RRC), contains tubules and vesicles with similar morphology to the internal vesicles observed by electron microscopy in CEF; and finally, caveolin-1 was also detected in early-sorting endosomes (CURL, compartment of uncoupling receptors and ligands). In this study, we show that following an intravenous administration of retinol-binding protein (RBP), there was a redistribution of caveolin-1 from the plasma membrane (CEF) to intracellular endocytic compartments (RRC and early-sorting endosomes). Thus, these results indicate that, in the hepatocyte, caveolae are dynamic structures actively interacting with the endocytic compartment.",0

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 12-week international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 449 postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis at 44 sites in 19 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Subjects were randomized to alendronate 70 mg once weekly or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The safety and tolerability of weekly alendronate and placebo were captured as clinical and laboratory adverse events. The primary endpoint was upper GI tolerability based on the incidence of upper GI tract adverse events. Secondary endpoints included the percentage of subjects who discontinued therapy due to a drug-related upper GI adverse event. Change from baseline in bone turnover as measured by the urinary N-telopeptide-collagen crosslinks corrected for creatinine (NTx/Cr) was assessed at 12 weeks as an indicator of efficacy. RESULTS: The percentages of subjects reporting an upper GI tract adverse event in the alendronate 70 mg once weekly group (9.8%) and the placebo group (9.4%) were similar. The risk difference between the two treatment groups (alendronate minus placebo) was 0.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), -5.1%, 5.9%]. Percentages of subjects who discontinued due to a drug-related upper GI adverse event were also similar (alendronate 2.7%; placebo 2.2%; risk difference 0.4%, 95% CI, -2.4, 3.3). The overall tolerability profile of alendronate 70 mg once weekly, as measured by the percentage 8.0% (95% CI, 1.4%, 15.0%) increase in the of subjects reporting any adverse event, was similar to that of placebo (risk difference 2.1%, 95% CI -6.9, 11.0). There was a significant 43.3% (95% CI, -47.9%, -38.3%) decrease from baseline in urinary NTx/Cr in the alendronate group compared with an placebo group at Week 12. CONCLUSION: Alendronate 70 mg administered once weekly to women and men with osteoporosis has an upper GI and overall tolerability profile similar to that of placebo.""",1

P92-01 Study Group","BACKGROUND: Patients with Sj�gren syndrome (SS) experience slowly progressive infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands by mononuclear cells. This leads to diminished secretions, with resultant symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia. Although pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets are currently indicated for the treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia, their effects on dry mouth or dry eyes in patients with SS are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of pilocarpine (Salagen) tablets as symptomatic treatment for dry mouth and dry eyes caused by SS in a multicenter, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: After providing written informed consent, 373 patients with primary or secondary SS and clinically significant dry mouth and dry eyes were randomized to receive 2.5-mg pilocarpine, 5-mg pilocarpine, or placebo tablets 4 times daily for 12 weeks. Symptoms were assessed by questionnaires with visual analog scales or categorical checkboxes. Whole-mouth salivary flow rates were measured. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of patients in the 5-mg pilocarpine group showed improvement compared with the placebo group (P< or =.01) in global assessments of dry mouth, dry eyes, and other symptoms of dryness (P< or =.05). Salivary flow was significantly increased 2- to 3-fold (P<.001) after administration of the first dose and was maintained throughout the 12-week study. The most common adverse effect was sweating, and no serious drug-related adverse experiences were reported.

During regular visits to the clinic, blood samples were collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations and clinical chemistry parameters including liver enzymes (LEs) and total bilirubin (TBR). Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as a grade > or =3 elevation in at least one of the tested LEs or TBR levels while on therapy. Analysis of predictive factors was focused on increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) to grade > or =2. Grade > or =3 elevation developed with an incidence of 0.15 per patient year (PY); only 3.4% of the patients developed grade > or =3 values for ASAT and/or ALAT (incidence 0.03 per PY). We found that patients who use a protease inhibitor (PI) in a nevirapine-containing regimen and patients who have chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection are at a higher risk for the development of increases in ASAT and/or ALAT to grade > or =2. In contrast, the plasma concentration of nevirapine does not appear to be a predictive factor in this study population.""",1

METHODS: Data from 8 clinical trials of IV abatacept in RA were pooled. Safety events were assessed during the short-term (duration </= 12 months) and cumulative (short-term plus longterm extensions) abatacept treatment periods. Incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for hospitalized infections and malignancies were compared with external RA cohorts and, for malignancies, with the US general population. RESULTS: There were 3173 IV abatacept-treated patients with 2331 patient-years of exposure in the short-term periods, and 4149 IV abatacept-treated patients with 12,132 patient-years of exposure in the cumulative period. Incidence rates for serious infections were low and consistent over time (3.68 for abatacept vs 2.60 for placebo during the short-term, and 2.87 for abatacept during the cumulative period). Hospitalized infections were generally similar to external RA patient cohorts and were consistent over time. Incidence rates of malignancies were similar for abatacept- and placebo-treated patients during the short-term period (0.73 vs 0.59) and remained low during the abatacept cumulative period (0.73). SIR of some tissue-specific malignancies (e.g., colorectal and breast) in the cumulative period tended to be lower, while others (lymphoma and lung) tended to be higher, compared with the general population; however, incidence rates were comparable with RA cohorts. Autoimmune events were rare and infusion reactions uncommon.

491,15069242,Cerebral perfusion pressure management of severe diffuse head injury: effect on brain compliance and intracranial pressure,"Cerebral perfusion pressure management (CPPM) is an accepted modality of treatment of severe diffuse head injury (SDHI). However, CPPM has the potential to cause transcapillary exudation in the presence of a disrupted blood brain barrier and can lead to further increase of intracranial pressure (ICP) and worsening of compliance. This study attempts to evaluate the effect of both transient and prolonged changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) on ICP and cerebral compliance as measured by the Pressure Volume Index (PVI), and to correlate changes in PVI with outcome at 12 months using the Glasgow Outcome Score. Prospective study in a neurosurgical ICU. Twenty-seven SDHI patients managed using standard protocol to maintain CPP above 70 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), ICP and CPP were monitored every half-hour. Daily monitoring of the PVI and ICP was done before, and after the induced elevation of MAP using IV Dopamine infusion. The relationship between CPP, MAP, ICP, PVI and outcome was evaluated. The paired and independent samples T-test, and the Pearson correlation coefficient. CPPM rarely leads to progressive rise in ICP. Maintaining CPP above 70mmHg does not influence ICP or PVI. Transient elevations in CPP above 70mmHg may produce a small rise in ICP. Trend of change in PVI influenced outcome despite similar ICP and CPP. Elevating the CPP above 70mmHg does not either reduce the ICP or worsen the compliance. Monitoring changes in compliance should form an integral part of CPPM. ",0
492,17984210,Duplicate copies of lic1 direct the addition of multiple phosphocholine residues in the lipopolysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae,"The genes of the lic1 operon (lic1A to lic1D) are responsible for incorporation of phosphocholine (PCho) into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae. PCho plays a multifaceted role in the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles of a range of mucosal pathogens, including H. influenzae. Structural studies of the LPS of nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI) have revealed that PCho can be linked to a hexose on any one of the oligosaccharide chain extensions from the conserved inner core triheptosyl backbone. In a collection of NTHI strains we found several strains in which there were two distinct but variant lic1D DNA sequences, genes predicted to encode the transferase responsible for directing the addition of PCho to LPS. The same isolates were also found to express concomitantly two PCho residues at distinct positions in their LPS. In one such NTHI isolate, isolate 1158, structural analysis of LPS from lic1 mutants confirmed that each of the two copies of lic1D directs the addition of PCho to a distinct location on the LPS. One position for PCho addition is a novel heptose, which is part of the oligosaccharide extension from the proximal heptose of the LPS inner core. Modification of the LPS by addition of two PCho residues resulted in increased binding of C-reactive protein and had consequential effects on the resistance of the organism to the killing effects of normal human serum compared to the effects of glycoforms containing one or no PCho. When bound, C-reactive protein leads to complement-mediated killing, indicating the potential biological significance of multiple PCho residues. ",0

This hinders analysis of nativity-related cancer disparities. In the current study, the authors evaluated multiple imputation of nativity status among Hispanic patients diagnosed with cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer and demonstrated the effect of multiple imputation on apparent nativity disparities in survival. Multiple imputation by logistic regression was used to generate nativity values (US-born vs foreign-born) using a priori-defined variables. The accuracy of the method was evaluated among a subset of cases. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate the effect of imputation by comparing survival among US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, with and without imputation of nativity. Birthplace was missing for 31%, 49%, and 39%, respectively, of cases of cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The sensitivity of the imputation strategy for detecting foreign-born status was ≥90% and the specificity was ≥86%. The agreement between the true and imputed values was ≥0.80 and the misclassification error was ≤10%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated different associations between nativity and survival when nativity was imputed versus when cases with missing birthplace were omitted from the analysis. Multiple imputation using variables available in the SEER data file can be used to accurately detect foreign-born status. This simple strategy may help researchers to disaggregate analyses by nativity and uncover important nativity disparities in regard to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival. ",0
495,23686600,Crizotinib for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer,"""PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of crizotinib in the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are reviewed. SUMMARY: Crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer Inc.) is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who exhibit assay-confirmed mutations of the gene coding for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The primary biochemical mechanism of crizotinib is to inhibit ALK expression, leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Crizotinib is metabolized and excreted after O-dealkylation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4/5; as crizotinib is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, its use entails a high potential for drug interactions, including confirmed interactions with ketoconazole and rifampin that can alter crizotinib pharmacokinetics. A Phase I trial involving patients with ALK gene mutation-positive NSCLC demonstrated significant disease control with oral crizotinib use, including an overall eight-week response rate of 87% and an estimated six-month survival of 72%. At the standard dosage of 250 mg twice daily, crizotinib is well tolerated. In clinical trials to date, the most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and visual disturbances; more severe toxicities included transaminase elevations (less than 7% of patients) and pneumonitis (less than 2% of patients). Hypogonadism leading to low testosterone levels appears to be universal among male patients treated with crizotinib. CONCLUSION: Crizotinib appears to be efficacious and well tolerated in patients with NSCLC and may have future potential applications in treating lymphomas and other cancers driven by ALK or c-MET gene mutations.""",1

497,26789727,Assessment of Minimal Residual Disease in Standard-Risk AML,"BACKGROUND: Despite the molecular heterogeneity of standard-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), treatment decisions are based on a limited number of molecular genetic markers and morphology-based assessment of remission. Sensitive detection of a leukemia-specific marker (e.g., a mutation in the gene encoding nucleophosmin [NPM1]) could improve prognostication by identifying submicroscopic disease during remission. METHODS: We used a reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay to detect minimal residual disease in 2569 samples obtained from 346 patients with NPM1-mutated AML who had undergone intensive treatment in the National Cancer Research Institute AML17 trial. We used a custom 51-gene panel to perform targeted sequencing of 223 samples obtained at the time of diagnosis and 49 samples obtained at the time of relapse. Mutations associated with preleukemic clones were tracked by means of digital polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Molecular profiling highlighted the complexity of NPM1-mutated AML, with segregation of patients into more than 150 subgroups, thus precluding reliable outcome prediction. The determination of minimal-residual-disease status was more informative. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle and was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). These results were validated in an independent cohort. On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts. Although mutations associated with preleukemic clones remained detectable during ongoing remission after chemotherapy, NPM1 mutations were detected in 69 of 70 patients at the time of relapse and provided a better marker of disease status. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of minimal residual disease, as determined by quantitation of NPM1-mutated transcripts, provided powerful prognostic information independent of other risk factors.

498,28946873,Myanmar mortality registration: an assessment for system improvement,"The vital registration system in Myanmar has a long history and geographical coverage is currently high. However, a recent assessment of vital registration systems of 148 countries showed poor performance of the death registration system in Myanmar, suggesting the need for improvement. This study assessed the quality of mortality data generated from the vital registration system with regard to mortality levels and patterns, quality of cause of death data, and completeness of death registration in order to identify areas for improvement. The study used registered deaths in 2013 from the vital registration system, data from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census, and mortality indicators and COD information for the country estimated by international organizations. The study applied the guidelines recommended by AbouZahr et al. 2010 to assess mortality levels and patterns and quality of cause of death data. The completeness of death registration was assessed by a simple calculation based on the estimated number of deaths. Findings suggested that the completeness of death registration was critically low (less than 60%). The under-registration was more severe in rural areas, in states and regions with difficult transportation and poor accessibility to health centers and for infant and child deaths. The quality of cause of death information was poor, with possible over-reporting of non-communicable disease codes and a high proportion of ill-defined causes of death (22.3% of total deaths). The results indicated that the vital registration system in Myanmar does not produce reliable mortality statistics. In response to monitoring mortalities as mandated by the Sustainable Development Goals, a significant and sustained government commitment and investment in strengthening the vital registration system in Myanmar is recommended.

Only 5 of 37 patients started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were able to complete treatment; in 29 patients drug toxicity occurred and in 19 treatment was changed due to adverse reactions that included rash, fever, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. Pentamidine was given to 30 patients (1 as initial treatment); toxicity occurred in 13 but only 4 required a change in drug. Adverse reactions from pentamidine included fever, rash, neutropenia, transaminase elevation, azotemia, and hypoglycemia. Patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole a median of 9.5 days, and pentamidine, a median of 12.5 days. Toxicity from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appeared earlier than toxicity associated with pentamidine (7.5 versus 9.5 days of treatment). In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has a higher incidence of adverse reactions than pentamidine (p less than 0.005).""",1

Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) techniques are now available for the detection of point mutations. The original method using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is disadvantageous, particularly for clinical tests and for analysis of large numbers of samples. Therefore, using an automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) technique with a molecular-sieving polymer solution, we have devised a completely automatic fluorescence-based PCR-SSCP system (CE-FSSCP) for the differential detection of point mutations that dose not require SSCP with radioisotopes and polyacrylamide gels. The automatic CE-FSSCP system was developed for reproducible operations in the denaturation of double-stranded DNA and electrophoresis of single-stranded DNA. The detection system consists of a 100 W I2 lamp and photomultiplier. We performed CE-FSSCP with a 2% linear polyacrylamide polymer solution containing 5% glycerol. Four tissue specimens of lung tumors with mutations in exon 7 of the p53 gene were found to have mutant alleles; six-base-pair deletion at codons 247-248, a one-base-pair deletion at codon 260, a one-base-pair deletion at codon 244 and a GGC to CGC substitution at codon 244. We expect this technique to prove useful for the clinical DNA diagnosis of human cancers, determination of the therapeutic effect of anticancer agents and for the study of the molecular aspects of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers.

504,23853552,The effect of intermittent antenatal iron supplementation on maternal and infant outcomes in rural Viet Nam: a cluster randomised trial,"Anemia affects over 500 million women, and in pregnancy is associated with impaired maternal and infant outcomes. Intermittent antenatal iron supplementation is an attractive alternative to daily dosing; however, the impact of this strategy on infant outcomes remains unclear. We compared the effect of intermittent antenatal iron supplementation with daily iron supplementation on maternal and infant outcomes in rural Viet Nam. This cluster randomised trial was conducted in Ha Nam province, Viet Nam. 1,258 pregnant women (< 16 wk gestation) in 104 communes were assigned to daily iron-folic acid (IFA), twice weekly IFA, or twice weekly multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation. Primary outcome was birth weight. Mean birth weight was 3,148 g (standard deviation 416). There was no difference in the birth weights of infants of women receiving twice weekly IFA compared to daily IFA (mean difference [MD] 28 g; 95% CI -22 to 78), or twice weekly MMN compared to daily IFA (MD -36.8 g; 95% CI -82 to 8.2). At 32 wk gestation, maternal ferritin was lower in women receiving twice weekly IFA compared to daily IFA (geometric mean ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80), and in women receiving twice weekly MMN compared to daily IFA (geometric mean ratio 0.62; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.68), but there was no difference in hemoglobin levels. Infants of mothers who received twice weekly IFA had higher cognitive scores at 6 mo of age compared to those who received daily IFA (MD 1.89; 95% CI 0.23 to 3.56). Twice weekly antenatal IFA or MMN did not produce a clinically important difference in birth weight, when compared to daily IFA supplementation. The significant improvement in infant cognitive outcomes at 6 mo of age following twice weekly antenatal IFA requires further exploration, and provides additional support for the use of intermittent, rather than daily, antenatal IFA in populations with low rates of iron deficiency.

The real time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression difference of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 between gastric cancer and its adjacent normal tissues. Then, the correlation between the expression of CADM1-AS1 in gastric cancer and the clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed by the Chi-square test. Moreover, the potential of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 in predicting the prognosis of patients with GC after the operation was assessed by the Log-rank test and the Cox's proportional hazards regression model. The expression of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 was significantly decreased in tumor tissues. According to the mean expression of lncRNA CADM1-AS1, the patients were divided into a high expression group and a low expression group, and the expression of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 in gastric cancer was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, N stage, M stage, and TNM stage. Moreover, the gastric cancer patients with higher expression of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 had a statistically better overall survival (OS) time and progression-free survival (PFS) time. In univariate analyses and multivariate analyses, the expression of lncRNA CADM1-AS1 was an independent prognosis index of patients with gastric cancer. LncRNA CADM1-AS1 might be a new prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer. ",0
507,24071734,Differential interaction of neuroleptics with apomorphine-induced behavior in rats as a function of changing levels of dopamine receptor stimulation,"Twenty-two neuroleptic drugs were studied for interaction with the behavior induced by intravenous injection of apomorphine in rats. All compounds dose-dependently shortened the duration of the apomorphine-induced agitation and-with the exception of clozapine-shortened the onset of the de-arousal grooming that typically occurs immediately after the agitation phase has been terminated. Progressively higher doses were required to antagonize higher levels of apomorphine at earlier time intervals after the intravenous injection. The compounds also decreased palpebral opening, and most of them suppressed grooming behavior at higher doses. Compounds differed considerably in dose increments required for: 1) suppression of grooming, from 0.33 for clozapine to >600 for remoxipride, raclopride, and droperidol; 2) blockade of agitation at 5 minutes after apomorphine, from 2.6 for pimozide to 165 for chlorprothixene and 254 for remoxipride; 3) mild decrease of palpebral opening, from 0.21 for sertindole to 191 for remoxipride; and 4) pronounced decrease of palpebral opening, from 10 for melperone to >820 for raclopride. Only four compounds were able to advance grooming to 15 minutes postapomorphine, but again dose increments varied considerably: droperidol (3.4), pimozide (9.1), raclopride (42), and remoxipride (383). Based on these results obtained in a single animal model, compounds were differentiated in terms of behavioral specificity, incisiveness (the power to counteract the effects of progressively higher apomorphine concentrations), and sedative side-effect liability. Possible explanations for the observed differences and clinical relevance are discussed.  ",0

Previous work has postulated that either E3BP, or a molecule cross-reactive with the PDC-E2 molecule, is uniquely expressed on the surface of biliary epithelial cells in PBC. To address this issue, we performed in situ hybridization for all of the major 2-OADC components at the mRNA level, including PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, OGDC-E2, PDC-E1a, BCOADC-E1a, OGDC-E1, and E3BP using 13 PBC and 9 control livers using 7 mitochondrial antisense probes. In both PBC and controls, the expression of all 2-OADC component mRNA studied herein were found in hepatocytes and infiltrating mononuclear cells, without significant differences. Interestingly, however, despite published data on immunohistochemical staining, interlobular bile ducts including the injured bile ducts in PBC were generally negative or only faintly positive, with the exception of 1 bile duct in 1 of 13 cases of PBC and 1 of 9 control liver specimens. Moreover, confocal microscopic examination and image analysis revealed that the mRNA signal intensity of each of the 2-OADC components in the bile ducts of PBC was relatively lower in comparison with control liver diseases. These data suggest that continuous enhanced synthesis of the 2-OADC components is not likely to be occurring in the biliary epithelial cells in PBC, and that an increase of PDC-E2 or E3BP immunoreactivity in PBC is caused by exogenous imported or cross-reactive molecules.",0

513,3219687,The safety and usefulness of buspirone as an anxiolytic drug in elderly versus young patients,"Buspirone, the prototype of the new azaspirodecanedione series of antianxiety drugs, was studied in over 6,000 patients in an open, multicenter trial to confirm its safety and usefulness for anxiety in a typical medical practice setting. Non-psychotic patients with clinically manifest anxiety that required anxiolytic drug therapy were enrolled to receive four weeks of treatment with a fixed dose of buspirone (15 mg/day). Patient data were analyzed according to age: the elderly group comprised 605 patients aged 65 years or older, and the younger group included 5,969 patients less than 65 years old. Both the elderly and younger patients achieved similar relief of anxiety within four weeks based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and global assessments of improvement. Most patients (80%) in both groups reported no side effects. Further, the side effect profile in the elderly differed little from that in the younger patients. Overall, the data indicate that buspirone may be administered to patients aged 65 years or older without any special adjustment in dose, does not cause unusual adverse age-related phenomena, and relieves moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety in elderly patients.",1
514,9287230,"Mutation of RFXAP, a regulator of MHC class II genes, in primary MHC class II deficiency","BACKGROUND: Major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) class II deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disease in which MHC class II molecules are absent. It is a genetically heterogeneous disease of gene regulation resulting from defects in several transactivating genes that regulate the expression of MHC class II genes. The mutations responsible for MHC class II deficiency are classified according to complementation group (a group in which the phenotype remains uncorrected in pairwise fusions of cells). There are three known complementation groups (A, B, and C). METHODS: To elucidate the genetic defect in patients with MHC class II deficiency that was not classified genetically, we performed direct complementation assays with the three genes known to regulate the expression of MHC class II genes, CIITA, RFX5, and RFXAP, and the relevant mutations were identified in each patient. RESULTS: Mutations in the RFXAP gene were found in three patients from unrelated families, and the resulting defect was classified as belonging to a novel complementation group (D). Transfection with the wild-type RFXAP gene restored the expression of MHC class II molecules in the patients' cells. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in a novel MHC class II transactivating factor, RFXAP, can cause MHC class II deficiency. These mutations abolish the expression of MHC class II genes and lead to the same clinical picture of immunodeficiency as in patients with mutations in the other two MHC class II regulatory genes.",0
515,12140298,A population-based comparison of strategies to prevent early-onset group B streptococcal disease in neonates,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines issued in 1996 in the United States recommend either screening of pregnant women for group B streptococcal colonization by means of cultures (screening approach) or assessing clinical risk factors (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: In a multistate retrospective cohort study, we compared the effectiveness of the screening and risk-based approaches in preventing early-onset group B streptococcal disease (in infants less than seven days old). We studied a stratified random sample of the 629,912 live births in 1998 and 1999 in eight geographical areas where there was active surveillance for group B streptococcal infection, including all births in which the neonate had early-onset disease. Women with no documented culture for group B streptococcus were considered to have been cared for according to the risk-based approach. RESULTS: We studied 5144 births, including 312 in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease. Antenatal screening was documented for 52 percent of the mothers. The risk of early-onset disease was significantly lower among the infants of screened women than among those in the risk-based group (adjusted relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.60). Because women whose providers had no strategy for prophylaxis may have been misclassified in the risk-based group, we excluded all women with risk factors and adequate time for prophylaxis who did not receive antibiotics. The adjusted relative risk of early-onset disease associated with the screening approach in this secondary analysis was similar--0.48 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for group B streptococcus during pregnancy prevents more cases of early-onset disease than the risk-based approach. Recommendations that endorse both strategies as equivalent warrant reconsideration.",0

517,18227271,The muscle chloride channel ClC-1 is not directly regulated by intracellular ATP,"ClC-1 belongs to the gene family of CLC Cl(-) channels and Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters. It is the major skeletal muscle chloride channel and is mutated in dominant and recessive myotonia. In addition to the membrane-embedded part, all mammalian CLC proteins possess a large cytoplasmic C-terminal domain that bears two so-called CBS (from cystathionine-beta-synthase) domains. Several studies indicate that these domains might be involved in nucleotide binding and regulation. In particular, Bennetts et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 2005. 280:32452-32458) reported that the voltage dependence of hClC-1 expressed in HEK cells is regulated by intracellular ATP and other nucleotides. Moreover, very recently, Bennetts et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 2007. 282:32780-32791) and Tseng et al. (J. Gen. Physiol. 2007. 130:217-221) reported that the ATP effect was enhanced by intracellular acidification. Here, we show that in striking contrast with these findings, human ClC-1, expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied with the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique, is completely insensitive to intracellular ATP at concentrations up to 10 mM, at neutral pH (pH 7.3) as well as at slightly acidic pH (pH 6.2). These results have implications for a general understanding of nucleotide regulation of CLC proteins and for the physiological role of ClC-1 in muscle excitation. ",0
518,23747952,Ramipril-induced liver injury: case report and review of the literature,"""BACKGROUND: Ramipril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEI), is a drug commonly used in the therapy of hypertension. ACEI-induced hepatotoxicity is rare, and most of the reported cases are associated with captopril. Here, we present the first case of ramipril-induced liver injury proven by positive rechallenge and a review of the literature including the data from the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS). METHODS: Patient data were collected in the Berlin Case-Control Surveillance Study for adverse drug reactions. PubMed research on ACEI-induced hepatotoxicity included all ACEIs except captopril; analysis of the FAERS database focused on ramipril-induced hepatotoxicity in the period 2009-2011. RESULTS: A 40-year-old male patient presented with acute onset jaundice and highly (>20-fold increase of alanine aminotranferase (ALT)) elevated liver enzymes (LEs). Viral or autoimmune hepatitis and biliary etiology were ruled out. Withdrawal of several medications including ramipril resulted in an immediate decrease in LEs, whereas a subsequent re-exposure with ramipril resulted in a striking increase in LEs (>35-fold increase of ALT). After definitely discontinuing ramipril, a rapid decline in LEs was observed, suggesting a certain causal relationship between drug intake and hepatic damage. Analysis of the FAERS database retrieved 65 cases of ramipril-associated hepatotoxicity, with jaundice being the most frequent hepatic adverse event. PubMed research detected 23 relevant publications, with enalapril being the ACEI most commonly reported as being associated with liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: ACEI-induced hepatotoxicity is rare. Our case confirms a hepatotoxic potential of ramipril, highlighting the need for alertness among physicians regarding this matter.""",1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of efalizumab, a T-cell modulator, in patients with plaque psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial involving 556 adult patients with stable, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and conducted at 30 study centers in the United States and Canada between January and July 2002. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 12 weekly doses of subcutaneous efalizumab, 1 mg/kg (n = 369), or placebo equivalent (n = 187). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At least 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75); improvement on the overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Itching Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Psoriasis Symptom Assessment (PSA) at week 12 vs baseline. RESULTS: Efalizumab-treated patients experienced significantly greater improvement on all end points than placebo-treated patients. Twenty-seven percent of efalizumab-treated patients achieved PASI-75 vs 4% of the placebo group ( P<.001). Efalizumab-treated patients exhibited significantly greater mean percentage improvement than placebo-treated patients on the overall DLQI (47% vs 14%; P<.001), Itching VAS (38% vs -0.2%; P<.001), and PSA frequency and severity subscales (48% vs 18% and 47% vs 17%, respectively; P<.001 for both) at the first assessment point. Efalizumab was safe and well tolerated, with primarily mild to moderate adverse events.

Here, we compared the frequency of two polymorphisms: monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter in LOAD patients versus controls. No evidence of association was observed when these polymorphisms were compared separately; however, the combination of the MAOA allele 1+the short allele of 5-HTTLPR+ApoE-epsilon4 was significantly more frequent in patients than in controls. It reinforces the hypothesis that different genes acting together might play a role in AD susceptibility. Based on these data, we suggest replicating these studies in larger samples of LOAD patients belonging to different ethnic groups. ",0

Allogeneic HSCT recipients from years 2000 to 2010 were evaluated in order to study the impact of being HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive in this population. Overall, 137 of 764 patients (18%) were HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive before HSCT. Overall survival, non-relapse mortality (NRM), acute and chronic graft-vs.-host disease were similar in HBcAb-positive and HBcAb-negative patients. Reactivation occurred in 14 patients (10%) within a median of 19 months after HSCT (range 9-77). Cause-specific hazard for reactivation was decreased in the case of an HBV-immune/exposed donor (HRadjusted = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.96; p 0.045) and increased in patients who received rituximab treatment (HRadjusted = 2.91; 95%CI, 0.77-10.97; p 0.11). Competing risk analyses documented a protective role of an HBV-immune/exposed donor (p 0.041) and an increased probability associated with the length of treatment with cyclosporine (p <0.001) and treatment with rituximab (but not with low-dose rituximab prophylaxis, p <0.001 at each landmark point). No differences in overall survival and NRM were found between patients with and without HBV reactivation.

522,3292364,Autoantibodies against nuclear envelope-associated proteins in primary biliary cirrhosis,"An antinuclear immunofluorescence pattern displaying a thin ring confined to the nuclear envelope was assessed in sera from 38 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and in sera from a control group of 277 patients with other antinuclear antibody-positive diseases. This rim-like antinuclear reactivity was present in sera from 20 primary biliary cirrhosis patients (52.6%) but in only two patients from the control group (0.7%) (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, this autoantibody was present in three of four primary biliary cirrhosis patients without antimitochondrial antibodies. Presence of this rim-like pattern in primary biliary cirrhosis did not correlate with the presence of associated autoimmune diseases nor with other clinical, biochemical, nor histological features of the disease. The antigenic specificity of sera displaying this antinuclear immunofluorescence pattern was characterized by Western blot analysis using an antigenic extract containing nuclear envelope proteins purified from rat liver. Sixteen of the 20 positive sera showed a common pattern of reactivity with a set of nuclear envelope-associated proteins approximately 200 kD in size. In conclusion, sera from primary biliary cirrhosis patients showing a rim-like fluorescent nuclear pattern have antinuclear autoantibodies that react specifically with components of the nuclear envelope. The high specificity of these new autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis indicate that they might be a serological marker of the disease, particularly useful in patients without antimitochondrial antibodies.",0
523,6138592,Cyclosporin in cadaveric renal transplantation: one-year follow-up of a multicentre trial,"""In a multicentre trial conducted in eight European centres, 232 recipients of cadaveric renal allografts were randomly allocated to receive either cyclosporin (117 patients) or azathioprine and steroids (115 patients) for immunosuppression. All patients have now been followed up for at least a year. 1-year graft survival was 72% in the cyclosporin group and 52% in the control group. 24 of the 84 patients in the cyclosporin group with functioning grafts at 1 year had been changed to azathioprine and steroids, and 1 patient had had prednisolone added to cyclosporin therapy; the other 59 patients were receiving cyclosporin as their sole immunosuppressive agent. 16 patients on cyclosporin treatment never received steroids. 1-year patient survival was 94% in the cyclosporin group and 92% in the control group. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in the prevalence of infection. Lymphoma did not develop in any patient. At 1 year post-transplantation, renal function was poorer in patients on cyclosporin than in those on conventional therapy. Thus the 1-year graft-survival rate is higher with cyclosporin alone as a first-line immunosuppressive agent than with azathioprine and steroids.""",1
524,15074031,Radiofrequency ablation in primary and metastatic hepatic tumors],"A number of alternative therapies have been used for the treatment of malignant hepatic tumors. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an evolving technology being used to treat patients with unresectable primary and metastatic hepatic cancers. RFA produces coagulative necrosis of the tumor through local tissue heating. Liver tumors can be treated percutaneously, laparoscopically, or during laparotomy, using ultrasonography to identify tumors and to guide placement of the RFA needle electrode. In general, RFA is a safe, well-tolerated, effective treatment for unresectable hepatic malignancies less than 6.0 cm in diameter. ",0
525,7660341,Comparative study of the effects of different glucocorticosteroids on eosinophil survival primed by cultured epithelial cell supernatants obtained from nasal mucosa and nasal polyps,"Supernatants from epithelial cell cultures enhance eosinophil survival in vitro, this effect being abrogated by previous incubation of eosinophils with glucocorticosteroids. This property has resulted in the development of an in vitro test to compare the potency of these drugs. A comparative study was performed with dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, deflazacort, and budesonide. Human epithelial cell conditioned media (HECM) was generated from cultured epithelial cells obtained from healthy nasal mucosa and polyps. Eosinophils isolated from the peripheral blood were incubated with different corticosteroids for one hour before the addition of HECM. The inhibitory potency of the four steroids on the eosinophil survival index was compared using the concentration of steroid causing 50% inhibition (IC50). Eosinophil survival was increased by HECM from both healthy nasal mucosa and polyps. All four steroids blocked HECM-induced eosinophil survival in a dose-dependent manner. On healthy nasal mucosa methylprednisolone was the least potent (IC50 = 536 nM), deflazacort (IC50 = 264 nM) was twice as potent as methylprednisolone, while budesonide and dexamethasone were approximately nine times as potent (both IC50 = 58 nM). When potency was evaluated on the promoting effects of the HECM obtained from nasal polyps, the inhibitory potencies were lower and consequently the IC50 values were higher when compared with HECM generated from healthy nasal mucosa: methylprednisolone (IC50 = 546 nM), deflazacort (IC50 = 390 nM), dexamethasone (IC50 = 76 nM), and budesonide (IC50 = 78 nM). The potencies of glucocorticosteroids can be compared by evaluating their effects on the survival of eosinophils previously primed by supernatants obtained from epithelial cell culture. The different effects of steroids on eosinophils primed by HECM obtained from healthy nasal mucosa compared with HECM obtained from nasal polyps suggest that polyps might represent more active tissue which is relatively resistant to treatment with corticosteroids.

526,12759480,Cost effectiveness of lung-volume-reduction surgery for patients with severe emphysema,"BACKGROUND: The National Emphysema Treatment Trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing lung-volume-reduction surgery with medical therapy for severe emphysema, included a prospective economic analysis. METHODS: After pulmonary rehabilitation, 1218 patients at 17 medical centers were randomly assigned to lung-volume-reduction surgery or continued medical treatment. Costs for the use of medical care, medications, transportation, and time spent receiving treatment were derived from Medicare claims and data from the trial. Cost effectiveness was calculated over the duration of the trial and was estimated for 10 years of follow-up with the use of modeling based on observed trends in survival, cost, and quality of life. RESULTS: Interim analyses identified a group of patients with excess mortality and little chance of improved functional status after surgery. When these patients were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratio for lung-volume-reduction surgery as compared with medical therapy was 190,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 53,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 10 years. Subgroup analyses identified patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity after pulmonary rehabilitation who had lower mortality and better functional status than patients who received medical therapy. The cost-effectiveness ratio in this subgroup was 98,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 21,000 dollars at 10 years. Bootstrap analysis revealed substantial uncertainty for the subgroup and 10-year estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Given its cost and benefits over three years of follow-up, lung-volume-reduction surgery is costly relative to medical therapy. Although the predictions are subject to substantial uncertainty, the procedure may be cost effective if benefits can be maintained over time.",0
527,23637086,Nanoparticle transport in epithelial cells: pathway switching through bioconjugation,"The understanding and control of nanoparticle transport into and through cellular compartments is central to biomedical applications of nanotechnology. Here, it is shown that the transport pathway of 50 nm polystyrene nanoparticles decorated with vitamin B12 in epithelial cells is different compared to both soluble B12 ligand and unmodified nanoparticles, and this is not attributable to B12 recognition alone. Importantly, the study indicates that vitamin B12 -conjugated nanoparticles circumnavigate the lysosomal compartment, the destination of soluble vitamin B12 ligand. Whereas cellular trafficking of soluble B12 is confirmed to occur via the clathrin-mediated pathway, transport of B12 -conjugated nanoparticles appears to predominantly take place by a route that is perturbed by caveolae-specific inhibitors. This data suggests that, following its conjugation to nanoparticles, in addition to dramatically increasing the cellular uptake of nanoparticles, the normal cell trafficking of B12 is switched to an alternative pathway, omitting the lysosomal stage: a result with important implications for oral delivery of nanoparticulate diagnostics and therapeutics.

529,24994830,Whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging in correlation to visual-evoked potentials in multiple sclerosis: a tract-based spatial statistics analysis,"Functional correlates of microstructural damage of the brain affected by MS are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate correlations of visual-evoked potentials with microstructural brain changes as determined by DTI in patients with demyelinating central nervous disease. Sixty-one patients with clinically isolated syndrome or MS were prospectively recruited. The mean P100 visual-evoked potential latencies of the right and left eyes of each patient were calculated and used for the analysis. For DTI acquisition, a single-shot echo-planar imaging pulse sequence with 80 diffusion directions was performed at 3T. Fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were calculated and correlated with mean P100 visual-evoked potentials by tract-based spatial statistics. Significant negative correlations between mean P100 visual-evoked potentials and fractional anisotropy and significant positive correlations between mean P100 visual-evoked potentials and radial diffusivity were found widespread over the whole brain. The highest significance was found in the optic radiation, frontoparietal white matter, and corpus callosum. Significant positive correlations between mean P100 visual-evoked potentials and axial diffusivity were less widespread, notably sparing the optic radiation. Microstructural changes of the whole brain correlated significantly with mean P100 visual-evoked potentials. The distribution of the correlations showed clear differences among axial diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and radial diffusivity, notably in the optic radiation. This finding suggests a stronger correlation of mean P100 visual-evoked potentials to demyelination than to axonal damage. ",0
530,15349915,A case-control study for differences among hepatitis B virus infections of genotypes A (subtypes Aa and Ae) and D,"""There are two subtypes of hepatitis B virus genotype A (HBV/A) and they are provisionally designated Aa (""""a"""" standing for Africa/Asia) and Ae (""""e"""" for Europe). In a case-control study, 78 HBV/Aa, 78HBV/Ae, and 78HBV/D carriers from several countries were compared. The prevalence of HBe antigen (HBeAg) in serum was significantly lower in carriers of HBV/Aa than in carriers of HBV/Ae (31% vs. 49%; P = .033), with a difference more obvious in the carriers aged 30 years or younger (34% vs. 67%; P = .029). HBV DNA levels in the carriers of HBV/Aa (median, 3.46 log copies/mL; 95% CI, 2.93-3.95) were significantly lower than those of carriers of HBV/Ae (6.09 log copies/mL; 95% CI, 4.24-7.64) or of carriers of HBV/D (5.48 log copies/mL; 95% CI, 4.06-7.02), regardless of the HBeAg status (P < .001). The most specific and frequent substitutions in 54 HBV/Aa isolates were double substitutions for T1809 (100%) and T1812 (96%) immediately upstream of the precore initiation codon, which would interfere with the translation of HBeAg in HBV/Aa infections. They were not detected in 57 HBV/Ae or 61 HBV/D isolates examined. The double mutation in the core promoter (T1762/A1764) was more frequent in both HBV/Aa (50%) and HBV/Ae (44%) than in HBV/D isolates (25%; P < .01), whereas the precore mutation (A1896) occurred in HBV/D isolates only (48%; P < .0001). In conclusion, the clearance of HBeAg from serum may occur by different mechanisms in HBV/Aa, HBV/Ae, and HBV/D infections, which may influence clinical manifestations in the Western countries where both genotypes A and D are prevalent.""",0
531,18703472,The effects of tibolone in older postmenopausal women,"""BACKGROUND: Tibolone has estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic effects. Although tibolone prevents bone loss, its effects on fractures, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease are uncertain. METHODS: In this randomized study, we assigned 4538 women, who were between the ages of 60 and 85 years and had a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less at the hip or spine or a T score of -2.0 or less and radiologic evidence of a vertebral fracture, to receive once-daily tibolone (at a dose of 1.25 mg) or placebo. Annual spine radiographs were used to assess for vertebral fracture. Rates of cardiovascular events and breast cancer were adjudicated by expert panels. RESULTS: During a median of 34 months of treatment, the tibolone group, as compared with the placebo group, had a decreased risk of vertebral fracture, with 70 cases versus 126 cases per 1000 person-years (relative hazard, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001), and a decreased risk of nonvertebral fracture, with 122 cases versus 166 cases per 1000 person-years (relative hazard, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.93; P=0.01). The tibolone group also had a decreased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative hazard, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.80; P=0.02) and colon cancer (relative hazard, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.96; P=0.04). However, the tibolone group had an increased risk of stroke (relative hazard, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.23; P=0.02), for which the study was stopped in February 2006 at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board. There were no significant differences in the risk of either coronary heart disease or venous thromboembolism between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tibolone reduced the risk of fracture and breast cancer and possibly colon cancer but increased the risk of stroke in older women with osteoporosis.

532,19584139,Association between global DNA hypomethylation in leukocytes and risk of breast cancer,"Global DNA hypomethylation may result in chromosomal instability and oncogene activation, and as a surrogate of systemic methylation activity, may be associated with breast cancer risk. Samples and data were obtained from women with incident early-stage breast cancer (I-IIIa) and women who were cancer free, frequency matched on age and race. In preliminary analyses, genomic methylation of leukocyte DNA was determined by measuring 5-methyldeoxycytosine (5-mdC), as well as methylation analysis of the LINE-1-repetitive DNA element. Further analyses used only 5-mdC levels. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of breast cancer in relation to amounts of methylation. In a subset of samples tested (n = 37), 5-mdC level was not correlated with LINE-1 methylation. 5-mdC level in leukocyte DNA was significantly lower in breast cancer cases than healthy controls (P = 0.001), but no significant case-control differences were observed with LINE-1 methylation (P = 0.176). In the entire data set, we noted significant differences in 5-mdC levels in leukocytes between cases (n = 176) and controls (n = 173); P value < 0.001. Compared with women in the highest 5-mdC tertile (T3), women in the second (T2; OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.84-2.65) and lowest tertile (T1; OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.65-4.94) had higher risk of breast cancer (P for trend < or = 0.001). Among controls only and cases and controls combined, only alcohol intake was found to be inversely associated with methylation levels. These findings suggest that leukocyte DNA hypomethylation is independently associated with development of breast cancer. ",0

534,16517009,Cross-transmission of nosocomial pathogens in an adult intensive care unit: incidence and risk factors,"The incidence and determinants of cross-transmission in an adult intensive care unit (ICU) were examined under normal conditions. Four hundred and thirty patients were followed for 3947 patient-days. Cross-transmitted pathogens were identified by genetic typing. A cross-transmission episode was defined as when two or more patients had indistinguishable isolates and had been treated in the ICU during intervals up to seven days apart. The direction of cross-transmission was confirmed if the incriminated pathogen was isolated from the donor before admission of the recipient; otherwise, both patients could potentially be a donor or a recipient. These patients were excluded from the risk factor analysis. Recipients of pathogens were compared with those who were not involved in cross-transmission. Out of 22 056 examined specimens, 275 isolates were typed and 40 episodes of cross-transmission were detected. The overall incidence of cross-transmission was 10.7 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 7.6-14.5] per 1000 patient-days. In multivariate analysis, those who were nursed in an understaffed environment [odds ratio (OR) = 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.8], had a nasogastric tube (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8) and were ventilated (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.0) for all of their stay, compared with none or part of their stay, showed an increase in the risk of cross-transmission. Repeated bronchoscopy (OR = 5.1, 95% CI 1.04-25) compared with no bronchoscopy and immunosuppresion (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.5) also increased the risk. This study showed that cross-transmission of nosocomial pathogens in the ICU is associated with understaffing, immunosuppression and factors that result in multiple staff/patient contacts, thus emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene.

535,32706533,Duodenal Microbiota in Stunted Undernourished Children with Enteropathy,"BACKGROUND: Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an enigmatic disorder of the small intestine that is postulated to play a role in childhood undernutrition, a pressing global health problem. Defining the incidence of this disorder, its pathophysiological features, and its contribution to impaired linear and ponderal growth has been hampered by the difficulty in directly sampling the small intestinal mucosa and microbial community (microbiota). METHODS: In this study, among 110 young children (mean age, 18 months) with linear growth stunting who were living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and had not benefited from a nutritional intervention, we performed endoscopy in 80 children who had biopsy-confirmed EED and available plasma and duodenal samples. We quantified the levels of 4077 plasma proteins and 2619 proteins in duodenal biopsy samples obtained from these children. The levels of bacterial strains in microbiota recovered from duodenal aspirate from each child were determined with the use of culture-independent methods. In addition, we obtained 21 plasma samples and 27 fecal samples from age-matched healthy children living in the same area. Young germ-free mice that had been fed a Bangladeshi diet were colonized with bacterial strains cultured from the duodenal aspirates. RESULTS: Of the bacterial strains that were obtained from the children, the absolute levels of a shared group of 14 taxa (which are not typically classified as enteropathogens) were negatively correlated with linear growth (length-for-age z score, r?=?-0.49; P?=?0.003) and positively correlated with duodenal proteins involved in immunoinflammatory responses. The representation of these 14 duodenal taxa in fecal microbiota was significantly different from that in samples obtained from healthy children (P<0.001 by permutational multivariate analysis of variance). Enteropathy of the small intestine developed in gnotobiotic mice that had been colonized with cultured duodenal strains obtained from children with EED. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for a causal relationship between growth stunting and components of the small intestinal microbiota and enteropathy and offer a rationale for developing therapies that target these microbial contributions to EED.

Our aim was to assess the oral, direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate for such prophylaxis. METHODS: In this double-blind study, we randomised 3494 patients undergoing total hip replacement to treatment for 28-35 days with dabigatran etexilate 220 mg (n=1157) or 150 mg (1174) once daily, starting with a half-dose 1-4 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (1162), starting the evening before surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of total venous thromboembolism (venographic or symptomatic) and death from all causes during treatment. On the basis of the absolute difference in rates of venous thromboembolism with enoxaparin versus placebo, the non-inferiority margin for the difference in rates of thromboembolism was defined as 7.7%. Efficacy analyses were done by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00168818. FINDINGS: Median treatment duration was 33 days. 880 patients in the dabigatran etexilate 220 mg group, 874 in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg group, and 897 in the enoxaparin group were available for the primary efficacy outcome analysis; the main reasons for exclusion in all three groups were the lack of adequate venographic data. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 60 (6.7%) of 897 individuals in the enoxaparin group versus 53 (6.0%) of 880 patients in the dabigatran etexilate 220 mg group (absolute difference -0.7%, 95% CI -2.9 to 1.6%) and 75 (8.6%) of 874 people in the 150 mg group (1.9%, -0.6 to 4.4%). Both doses were thus non-inferior to enoxaparin. There was no significant difference in major bleeding rates with either dose of dabigatran etexilate compared with enoxaparin (p=0.44 for 220 mg, p=0.60 for 150 mg). The frequency of increases in liver enzyme concentrations and of acute coronary events during the study did not differ significantly between the groups. INTERPRETATION: Oral dabigatran etexilate was as effective as enoxaparin in reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism after total hip replacement surgery, with a similar safety profile.""",1
537,16507906,Emerin-lacking mice show minimal motor and cardiac dysfunctions with nuclear-associated vacuoles,"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an inherited muscular disorder clinically characterized by slowly progressive weakness affecting humero-peroneal muscles, early joint contractures, and cardiomyopathy with conduction block. The X-linked recessive form is caused by mutation in the EMD gene encoding an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, emerin. In this study, mutant mice lacking emerin were produced by insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into exon 6 of the coding gene. Tissues taken from mutant mice lacked emerin. The mutant mice displayed a normal growth rate indistinguishable from their littermates and were fertile. No marked muscle weakness or joint abnormalities were observed; however, rotarod test revealed altered motor coordination. Electrocardiography showed mild prolongation of atrioventricular conduction time in emerin-lacking male mice older than 40 weeks of age. Electron microscopic analysis of skeletal and cardiac muscles from emerin-lacking mice revealed small vacuoles, which mostly bordered the myonuclei. Our results suggest that emerin deficiency causes minimal motor and cardiac dysfunctions in mice with a structural fragility of myonuclei. ",0

In a double-blind study 100 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with either high-dose vitamin C (10 g daily) or placebo. Overall, these patients were in very good general condition, with minimal symptoms. None had received any previous treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Vitamin C therapy showed no advantage over placebo therapy with regard to either the interval between the beginning of treatment and disease progression or patient survival. Among patients with measurable disease, none had objective improvement. On the basis of this and our previous randomized study, it can be concluded that high-dose vitamin C therapy is not effective against advanced malignant disease regardless of whether the patient has had any prior chemotherapy.",0
540,18335481,Tissue Doppler imaging for detecting onset of muscle activity,"Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is typically used to image and quantify tissue motion. We investigated whether this method would serve as a viable alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) in providing a reliable and valid measure of the onset of muscle activity. Ten healthy subjects performed maximal knee extension exercises at 0 degrees /s (isometric), 60 degrees /s, 120 degrees /s, 180 degrees /s, and 240 degrees /s (5 times each, on each side), using an isokinetic dynamometer. Simultaneous EMG and TDI velocity (superimposed on motion-mode ultrasound cine-loops) recordings were made from vastus lateralis. All tests were repeated 1 week later. There was a good correlation between the onset times determined with TDI velocity and EMG: r = 0.78 (day 1), and r = 0.80 (day 2) (each P < 0.001). The mean difference (and SD) in muscle onset time between the two methods (TDI minus EMG) was -20.3 +/- 31.0 ms (day 1) and -17.4 +/- 27.2 ms (day 2). TDI represents a reliable and valid measure of detecting onset of muscle activity. The mean difference between EMG and TDI onset times (approximately 20 ms) is likely explained by electromechanical delay. TDI represents a viable method for measuring the onset of muscle activity; it may offer a non-invasive alternative to fine-wire EMG for use with small or deep muscles. ",0
541,16952291,Identification of a novel 974C-->G nonsense mutation of the MRP2/ABCC2 gene in a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome and analysis of the effects of rifampicin and ursodeoxycholic acid on serum bilirubin and bile acids,"Rifampicin (RIF) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapies have beneficial effects in chronic cholestatic diseases. These may result in part from the induction of multidrug-resistance protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2) expression in the liver and kidney. However, the precise mechanisms by which RIF and UDCA act in cholestasis remain unclear. In the present study, we report the effects of chronic administration of both drugs in a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS), an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the absence of functional MRP2 protein at the canalicular hepatocyte membrane. A novel 974C-->G nonsense mutation was identified in the MRP2 gene sequence from this patient. RIF induced further increase in conjugated bilirubinemia, whereas concomitant administration of RIF and UDCA led to a dramatic rise in serum bile acid concentrations. These biochemical effects, which are in marked contrast to those observed in cholestatic settings, were concomitant with an increased MRP3, but not MRP4, expression on basolateral hepatocyte membrane. Such findings highlight the key role of MRP2 in the pharmacological properties of RIF and UDCA and suggest that both drugs should be used with caution in pathologic settings in which MRP2 expression may be downregulated, as in advanced stage of cholestatic diseases.",1

The proliferation and viability of HFL cells were evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, and the cells increased by more than 100-fold by culture for 15 d. The levels of expression of albumin (ALB), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 mRNAs in HFL cells increased with culture period, while that of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNA decreased gradually. In HepG2 cells, however, the expression levels of ALB and AFP mRNAs were not changed, and the levels of expression of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 mRNAs decreased gradually. The mRNA expression of major CYP isoforms including CYP3As, i.e., CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C (2C9 and 2C19), CYP2D6, and CYP2E1, could be detected in HepG2 cells. With the exception of CYP1A2, all of the CYP mRNAs expressed in HepG2 cells were detected in HFL cells. In HFL cells, CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 mRNA expression levels were markedly up-regulated by dexamethasone (DEX), but not by rifampicin (RIF). CYP3A5 mRNA expression was increased to a level 3-fold greater than control by DEX. On the other hand, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 mRNA expression levels in HepG2 cells were increased from 2- to 3-fold by treatment with DEX and RIF. Pregnane X receptor mRNA was expressed in HepG2 cells, but not HFL cells. These results indicate that the character of HFL cells with regard to CYP expression was different from that of HepG2 cells.

543,11807149,Frequency of uterine contractions and the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery,"BACKGROUND: The measurement of the frequency of uterine contractions has not been useful for reducing the rate of preterm delivery in randomized trials. Nonetheless, ambulatory monitoring of contractions continues to be used in clinical practice. METHODS: We assessed the frequency of uterine contractions as a predictor of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery before 35 weeks of gestation. We enrolled women with singleton pregnancies between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation. The women used a contraction monitor at home to record contraction frequency twice daily on 2 or more days per week from enrollment to delivery or 37 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: We obtained 34,908 hours of successful monitoring recordings from 306 women. Although more contractions were recorded from women who delivered before 35 weeks than from women who delivered at 35 weeks or later, we could identify no threshold frequency that effectively identified women who delivered preterm infants. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of a maximal hourly frequency of contractions of four or more between 4 p.m. and 3:59 a.m. were 9 percent and 25 percent, respectively, at 22 to 24 weeks and 28 percent and 23 percent at 27 to 28 weeks. Other proposed screening tests, such as digital and ultrasound evaluations of the cervix and assays for fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions, also had low sensitivity and positive predictive value for preterm labor. CONCLUSIONS: Although the likelihood of preterm delivery increases with an increased frequency of uterine contractions, measurement of this frequency is not clinically useful for predicting preterm delivery.",0
544,23124649,Phase II study of nedaplatin and irinotecan in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: The standard chemotherapy for Japanese patients with extensive disease of small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is cisplatin and irinotecan. METHODS: Patients with untreated ED-SCLC were treated with nedaplatin (NP) at 50 mg/m(2) and irinotecan (CPT) at 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for four cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were registered. Nineteen patients were male and six female, with a median age of 64 years (50-79 years). Two patients had a performance status of 2. Nineteen of them were able to receive 4 courses of NP and CPT chemotherapy. Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 8.0, 68.0, and 36.0 % of patients, respectively. Other grade 3 toxicities were SGOT, hyponatremia, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, febrile neutropenia, oral hemorrhage, and pneumonia. Grade 4 fatigue occurred in one patient. There was no treatment-related death. The overall response rate was 100 %. The median progression-free and overall survivals were 6.6 and 16.0 months, respectively, and the 2-year survival rate was 28 %. CONCLUSION: NP with CPT is effective and safe for patients with ED-SCLC.",1
545,7654290,Epidemiology of trichinosis in Chile. Prevalence study by immunodiagnostic reactions],"In the period 1983-1994 a series of seroepidemiological surveys, by using immunodiagnostic tests for trichinosis, was carried out in 138 localities and health institutions from the 13 regions of the country. Thus, a total of 12,882 randomly selected persons, with different sex and age distribution, were submitted to precipitin test and indirect hemagglutination test for trichinosis. One hundred and ninety one (1.5%) persons resulted positive for trichinosis. Higher rates of infection were observed in central and southern Chile. No differences of positivity, according to age sex, but constant increase parallel to age of the individual were detected. The general prevalence rate of infection of 1.5% is in a reasonable accordance with the prevalence of 2.0% found in human corpses in 1992. ",0

547,10362820,"Effect of cigar smoking on the risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer in men","BACKGROUND: The sale of cigars in the United States has been increasing for the past six years. Cigar smoking is a known risk factor for certain cancers and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, unlike the relation between cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease, the association between cigar smoking and cardiovascular disease has not been clearly established. METHODS: We performed a cohort study among 17,774 men 30 to 85 years of age at base line (from 1964 through 1973) who were enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente health plan and who reported that they had never smoked cigarettes and did not currently smoke a pipe. Those who smoked cigars (1546 men) and those who did not (16,228) were followed from 1971 through the end of 1995 for a first hospitalization for or death from a major cardiovascular disease or COPD, and through the end of 1996 for a diagnosis of cancer. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, cigar smokers, as compared with nonsmokers, were at higher risk for coronary heart disease (relative risk, 1.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.45), COPD (relative risk, 1.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.91), and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (relative risk, 2.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.01 to 4.06) and lung (relative risk, 2.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 4.11), with evidence of dose-response effects. There appeared to be a synergistic relation between cigar smoking and alcohol consumption with respect to the risk of oropharyngeal cancers and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. CONCLUSIONS: Independently of other risk factors, regular cigar smoking can increase the risk of coronary heart disease, COPD, and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and lung.",0
548,23212706,Characterization of the inhibition of hepatitis C virus entry by in vitro-generated and patient-derived oxidized low-density lipoprotein,"Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) has been reported as an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell entry, making it the only known component of human lipid metabolism with an antiviral effect on HCV. However, several questions remain open, including its effect on full-length cell-culture-grown HCV (HCVcc) of different genotypes or on other steps of the viral replication cycle, its mechanism of action, and whether endogenous oxLDL shares the anti-HCV properties of in vitro-generated oxLDL. We combined molecular virology tools with oxLDL serum measurements in different patient cohorts to address these questions. We found that oxLDL inhibits HCVcc at least as potently as HCV pseudoparticles. There was moderate variation between genotypes, with genotype 4 appearing the most oxLDL sensitive. Intracellular RNA replication and assembly and release of new particles were unaffected. HCV particles entering target cells lost oxLDL sensitivity with time kinetics parallel to anti-SR-BI (scavenger receptor class B type I), but significantly earlier than anti-CD81, suggesting that oxLDL acts by perturbing interaction between HCV and SR-BI. Finally, in chronically HCV-infected individuals, endogenous serum oxLDL levels did not correlate with viral load, but in HCV-negative sera, high endogenous oxLDL had a negative effect on HCV infectivity in vitro. CONCLUSION: oxLDL is a potent pangenotype HCV entry inhibitor that maintains its activity in the context of human serum and targets an early step of HCV entry.",0

550,3001394,Tension development in frog skeletal muscle induced by silver ions,"In single fibers of frog toe muscles placed in a Cl- free MOPS solution containing 1.8 mM Ca2+, tension developed slowly in the presence of very low concentrations of Ag+. This tension was not blocked by the administration of Co2+ or Ni2+. On the other hand, two types of transient tensions developed with the application of 5 microM Ag+, in fibers pretreated with 0-Ca2+ MOPS solution, containing either 2 mM Co2+ or 1mM Ni2+, for 10 min. In the presence of divalent cations or TTX, the first repetitive twitch-like contraction disappeared, indicating this tension is induced by action potentials repeatedly generated by the lack of divalent cations. The 2nd subsequent transient tension was caused by 5 microM Ag+ in the presence of various kinds of divalent cations, or TTX. After reversion to the resting tension, the fiber was contracted by adding more than 0.1 mM of Ca2+ or 25 mM caffeine to the external medium. Even when placed in a Ca2+-free solution containing 3 mM EGTA and 3 mM Mg2+ for 30 min, the fiber still developed an appreciable tension in response to 5 microM Ag+. These findings suggest that a transient development of the Ag+-induced tension does not require the presence of external Ca2+. A specific sulfhydryl reagent, pCMPS, did not contract the muscle fiber. Therefore, Ag+ may develop tension by mediating unknown chemical reaction(s) other than the sulfhydryl group on T-tubular membrane proteins. ",0
551,17973561,Altered reproduction in fish exposed to pulp and paper mill effluents: roles of individual compounds and mill operating conditions,"For the last 20 years, studies conducted in North America, Scandinavia, and New Zealand have shown that pulp and paper mill effluents affect fish reproduction. Despite the level of effort applied, few leads are available regarding the factors responsible. Effluents affect reproduction in multiple fish species, as evidenced by decreased gonad size, decreased circulating and gonadal production of reproductive steroids, altered expression of secondary sex characteristics, and decreased egg production. Several studies also have shown that effluent constituents are capable of accumulating in fish and binding to sex steroid receptors/ binding proteins. Studies aimed at isolating biologically active substances within the pulping and papermaking process have provided clues about their source, and work has progressed in identifying opportunities for in-mill treatment technologies. Following comparisons of manufacturing processes and fish responses before and after process changes, it can be concluded that effluent from all types of mill processes are capable of affecting fish reproduction and that any improvements could not be attributed to a specific process modification (because mills normally performed multiple modifications simultaneously). Improved reproductive performance in fish generally was associated with reduced use of molecular chlorine, improved condensate handling, and liquor spill control. Effluent biotreatment has been effective in reducing some effects, but biotreated effluents also have shown no difference or an exacerbation of effects. The role of biotreatment in relation to effects on fish reproduction remains unclear and needs to be resolved. ",0
552,18579814,"Polygenes, risk prediction, and targeted prevention of breast cancer","BACKGROUND: New developments in the search for susceptibility alleles in complex disorders provide support for the possibility of a polygenic approach to the prevention and treatment of common diseases. METHODS: We examined the implications, both for individualized disease prevention and for public health policy, of findings concerning the risk of breast cancer that are based on common genetic variation. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the risk profile generated by the known, common, moderate-risk alleles does not provide sufficient discrimination to warrant individualized prevention. However, useful risk stratification may be possible in the context of programs for disease prevention in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical use of single, common, low-penetrance genes is limited, but a few susceptibility alleles may distinguish women who are at high risk for breast cancer from those who are at low risk, particularly in the context of population screening.",0
553,15054677,Distribution of Nevskia ramosa and other rosette-forming neustonic bacteria,"Samples from 27 natural and artificial aquatic environments were analyzed for the presence of rosette-forming bacteria by a combined cultivation and molecular biological approach. Rosette-forming bacteria developed in 20 enrichment cultures with ammonia-free medium under air. Three morphotypes could be distinguished. The most abundant type I resembled Nevskia ramosa and formed hydrophobic, flat, and dichotomously branching rosettes. Type II rosettes were three-dimensional and were observed in 10 enrichments, often together with those of type I. These rosettes were hydrophilic indicating life in the hyponeuston underneath the air-water interface. Rosettes of a third type consisted of hydrophilic slime stalks that were excreted at the cell poles and were observed in only one sample. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the Nevskia-specific probes NEV177 and NEV656, the presence of Nevskia ramosa was demonstrated in exactly those samples that showed type I rosettes. In a series of most-probable-number experiments, during a calm and sunny weather period 430,000 Nevskia-like bacteria per mL were found in surface samples, while during rainy weather and within the water body the numbers were lower by several orders of magnitude. Five pure cultures isolated from various enrichments were characterized in detail. The two isolates forming type I rosettes were identified as Nevskia ramosa by 16S rDNA analysis. However, comparison by genomic fingerprinting (ERIC-PCR) revealed differences between the two isolates and previously characterized strains. The 16S rDNA of two isolates forming type II rosettes showed 97.6% similarity to that of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The closest relative of the isolate forming type III rosettes was Sphingomonas parapaucimobilis (96.4% sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA sequence). All isolates grew homogeneously submersed if ammonia was added to the medium. Our results indicate that Nevskia ramosa is a widely distributed epineustonic bacterium, which can specifically be deleted by its flat and hydrophobic rosettes on ammonia-free media. ",0

555,9872479,Coexistent minocycline-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis,"""OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to raise awareness among rheumatologists about two autoimmune disorders associated with long-term minocycline therapy that can coexist in the same patient. We provide an update on the occurrence of these disorders, their main characteristics, and the current knowledge of potential pathogenic mechanisms. METHODS: We searched the medical literature in English indexed in MEDLINE from 1966 through April 1998 for the term minocycline combined with each of the following: autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic hepatitis, lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO), arthritis, vasculitis, and toxicity. We also reviewed relevant references cited in the articles our search uncovered. RESULTS: We identified over 60 minocycline-induced cases of SLE and 24 cases of minocycline-induced AIH. Both autoimmune disorders coexisted in the same patient in 12 cases reported in the literature and in one case seen at our clinic. These 13 patients were characterized by symmetrical polyarthralgias/polyarthritis, elevated liver enzymes, and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA); they also were generally anti-histone-negative, and only two patients had perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA). After withdrawal of minocycline, their symptoms resolved, and abnormal laboratory results normalized or markedly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Although data on the actual prevalence of autoimmune disorders induced by minocycline are not available, numerous case reports or small series deal with such disorders. Probable pathogenic mechanisms for each of these conditions are discussed.""",1
556,15917383,Statins and the risk of colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and effective lipid-lowering agents. Statins inhibit the growth of colon-cancer cell lines, and secondary analyses of some, but not all, clinical trials suggest that they reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study is a population-based case-control study of patients who received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in northern Israel between 1998 and 2004 and controls matched according to age, sex, clinic, and ethnic group. We used a structured interview to determine the use of statins in the two groups and verified self-reported statin use by examining prescription records in a subgroup of patients for whom prescription records were available. RESULTS: In analyses including 1953 patients with colorectal cancer and 2015 controls, the use of statins for at least five years (vs. the nonuse of statins) was associated with a significantly reduced relative risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.63). This association remained significant after adjustment for the use or nonuse of aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; the presence or absence of physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of colorectal cancer; ethnic group; and level of vegetable consumption (odds ratio, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.74). The use of fibric-acid derivatives was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 2.01). Self-reported statin use was confirmed for 276 of the 286 participants (96.5 percent) who reported using statins and whose records were available. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was associated with a 47 percent relative reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer after adjustment for other known risk factors. Because the absolute risk reduction is likely low, further investigation of the overall benefits of statins in preventing colorectal cancer is warranted.",0
557,16864918,Efficacy and safety of leflunomide alone and in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis patients who develop refractoriness are left with no alternatives other than leflunomide and costly biological response modifiers. Leflunomide, though effective, was associated with adverse events and has not been extensively studied in the Indian population. AIMS: Determination of safety and efficacy of leflunomide alone and if not useful, in combination with methotrexate in patients refractory to conventional disease-modifying agents. SETTING AND DESIGN: Open labeled clinical trial with leflunomide [100 mg, OD x 3 days followed by 20 mg, OD x 6 months], if no improvement at three months, combined with methotrexate [5-7.5 mg, OD x 3 months] at a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary endpoint in the improvement in EULAR criteria and secondary endpoints were patient and physician global evaluation, incidence of remission and biochemical and clinical adverse events. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Chi square test or Fisher's exact test and parametric and non-parametric repeat measure ANOVA were used for analysis. RESULTS: Among 84 patients who were included in the study, leflunomide showed improvement and remission in 52 [62%] and 6 [7%] in six months, by intention to treat analysis. Adverse events were observed in 15, discontinuation in 5 and 24 dropped out. With combination in 11 patients, there was improvement and remission in nine [91%] and one [9%] after three months. Adverse events were observed in six and one discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: If regular monitoring of hepatic function and hematological parameters are performed, leflunomide is an effective and safe drug in the Indian population in resistant rheumatoid arthritis patients, especially if used alone.",1
558,7678126,Current methods of mutation detection,"Mutation detection is important in all areas of biology. Detection of unknown mutations can involve sequencing of kilobases of DNA, often in many patients. This has lead to the development of methods to screen DNA for mutations as well as methods to detect previously described mutations. This review discusses current methods used for such purposes with special emphasis on genetic diseases of humans. However, savings can be made by similar means in other areas of biology where repetitive or extensive sequencing for comparative purposes needs to be done. This review covers the methods used for detection of unknown mutations, namely the ribonuclease, denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis, carbodiimide, chemical cleavage, single-strand conformation polymorphism, heteroduplex and sequencing methods. Once mutations have been defined they can be searched for repeatedly by methods referred to as diagnostic methods. Such methods include allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, allele-specific amplification, ligation, primer extension and the artificial introduction of restriction sites. We can now choose from a range of excellent methods, but the choice will usually depend on the background of the laboratory and/or the application in hand. Screening methods are evolving to more satisfactory forms, and the diagnostic methods can be automated to screen whole populations inexpensively. ",0
559,10504728,Crystal structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from hepatitis C virus reveals a fully encircled active site,"Various classes of nucleotidyl polymerases with different transcriptional roles contain a conserved core structure. Less is known, however, about the distinguishing features of these enzymes, particularly those of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase class. The 1. 9 A resolution crystal structure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) presented here provides the first complete and detailed view of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. While canonical polymerase features exist in the structure, NS5B adopts a unique shape due to extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb polymerase subdomains that serve to encircle the enzyme active site. Several insertions in the fingers subdomain account for intersubdomain linkages that include two extended loops and a pair of antiparallel alpha-helices. The HCV NS5B apoenzyme structure reported here can accommodate a template:primer duplex without global conformational changes, supporting the hypothesis that this structure is essentially preserved during the reaction pathway. This NS5B template:primer model also allows identification of a new structural motif involved in stabilizing the nascent base pair.",1
560,17987884,Update on ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: Part 1--Incidence and pathogenesis,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication during controlled ovarian stimulation. It can be associated with severe morbidity and may even be fatal. The etiology of the condition and predisposing factors are still not fully understood. Data concerning pathophysiology in patients with OHSS were searched using PubMed and other medical data bases. The incidence of severe OHSS, as calculated by World Health Organization (WHO), is 0.2-1% of all stimulation cycles in assisted reproduction. Considerations on OHSS classifications and forms of manifestations are discussed in detail. New insights concerning genetics and altered FSH receptor are given. OHSS may involve, according to its grade of severity, elevated or decreased levels of growth factors, cytokines, mediators, changes in hormones, renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein system. There are massive electrolytic imbalances and changes in hemodynamic and fluid metabolism. Furthermore, liver and pulmonary dysfunction is observed as well as increased coagulation with subsequent thromboembolism. The influence of OHSS on the pregnancy rate and outcome of pregnancy is a matter of controversy. Patients with OHSS have high pregnancy rates with a tendency to an increased incidence of abortion.",1

We compared these two combinations directly in treatment-naive patients. METHODS: In this open-label, international non-inferiority study, 883 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients were randomly assigned to receive atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily (n=440) or lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n=443), in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine 300/200 mg once daily. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated centralised randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline levels of HIV RNA (viral load) and geographic region. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with viral load less than 50 copies per mL at week 48. The main efficacy analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00272779. FINDINGS: At week 48, 343 (78%) of 440 patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir and 338 (76%) of 443 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir had achieved a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1.7%, 95% CI -3.8 to 7.1). Mean increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were similar (203 cells per muL in the atazanavir/ritonavir group vs 219 cells per muL in the lopinavir/ritonavir group). 25 (6%) patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group and 26 (6%) in the lopinavir/ritonavir group were virological failures by week 48. Only two patients, both in the atazanavir/ritonavir group, had non-polymorphic protease inhibitor resistance mutations emerge on treatment, which conferred phenotypic resistance to atazanavir in one patient. Serious adverse events were noted in 51 (12%) of 441 patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group and in 42 (10%) of 437 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. Fewer patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group than in the lopinavir/ritonavir group experienced grade 2-4 treatment-related diarrhoea (10 [2%] vs 50 [11%]) and nausea (17 [4%] vs 33 [8%]). Grade 2-4 jaundice was seen in 16 (4%) of 441 patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group versus none of 437 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group; grade 3-4 increases in total bilirubin were seen in 146 (34%) of 435 patients on atazanavir/ritonavir and in one (<1%) of 431 patients on lopinavir/ritonavir. INTERPRETATION: In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir/ritonavir once-daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir/ritonavir twice-daily, with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia.""",1
562,22198540,Maximally tolerated busulfan systemic exposure in combination with fludarabine as conditioning before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,"Systemic exposure to high-dose busulfan has been correlated with efficacy and toxicity after hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignancy. We used the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to prospectively determine the maximally tolerated systemic exposure to i.v. busulfan when given once daily after fludarabine administered at 40 mg/m(2) for 4 days. Three target AUC levels were planned: 6,000, 7,500, and 9,000 muM-min. Included were patients 16 to 65 years old, with a hematologic malignancy, an HLA A, B, or C, DRB1 8/8 or 7/8 matched donor, Karnofsky performance status >/=70%, and adequate organ function. For level 1 patients, i.v. busulfan doses 1 and 2 were 170 mg/m(2)/day, then doses 3 and 4 were adjusted based on first-dose pharmacokinetic modeling to achieve an average daily AUC of 6,000 muM-min. Doses 1 and 2 for the subsequent cohorts were based on the level 1 data: 180 mg/m(2)/day for AUC 7,500 muM-min (level 2) and 220 mg/m(2)/day for AUC 9,000 muM-min (level 3), with pharmacokinetic targeting for doses 3 and 4. Pharmacokinetic analysis after the last dose showed that 88% of the patients had been exposed to a mean AUC within 10% of the target. Forty patients were treated at level 1, 29 patients at level 2, and three patients at level 3. DLT was veno-occlusive disease of the liver, which occurred in none of 40 patients (0%) at level 1, two of 29 patients (7%) at level 2, and three of three patients (100%) at level 3. Dermatitis (P < .01) and pulmonary toxicity (P = .01) were also increased at higher AUC levels. Level 2 (7,500 muM-min x 4 days) was the maximally tolerated AUC. Within the confines of the trial's small sample size, there was no suggestion that escalating busulfan AUC from 6,000 to 7,500 muM-min x 4 days increased nonrelapse mortality. Assessment of the higher busulfan AUC on relapse prevention requires trials in patients with a homogeneous risk of relapse.",1
563,2948451,Etretin therapy for severe psoriasis. Evaluation of initial clinical responses,"We have investigated the clinical responses of 21 patients with severe psoriasis to therapy with etretin, a metabolite of etretinate. In a preliminary double-blind dose-finding study, the optimum dose of etretin was determined to be 50 mg/d (mean, 0.66 mg/kg/d). In an open study, patients receiving etretin therapy were followed up for a minimum of six months. An excellent or good response (greater than 50% clearance) was obtained in 18 of 21 patients. The incidence of mucocutaneous side effects from etretin therapy was similar to that previously reported with etretinate therapy. As a group, patients who received etretin therapy for six or more months showed no significant aberrations from normal levels of serum lipids or serum liver enzymes. However, five patients had mild elevation of liver enzymes or blood lipids, which were corrected by dose reduction. Etretin showed equivalent efficacy to that previously reported with etretinate in severe recalcitrant plaque psoriasis vulgaris. Taken with the reportedly more rapid clearance of etretin from the body, there may be clinical advantages of the use of etretin over the use of etretinate.",1
564,18035189,Nelarabine: a novel purine antimetabolite antineoplastic agent,"""BACKGROUND: Nelarabine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2005 for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) that has not responded to or has relapsed after treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the pharmacology, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of nelarabine. Also reviewed are nelarabine's clinical efficacy in T-ALL, T-LBL, and other hematologic malignancies; its toxicity profile, dosage, and administration; and areas of ongoing and future research. METHODS: Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007), and the American Society of Hematology database (2003-2006) using the terms nelarabine, Arranon, 506U78, and 2-amino-6-methoxypurine arabinoside. The reference lists of the identified articles were searched for additional sources. Product information obtained from the manufacturer of nelarabine was consulted, as were the FDA reviews of nelarabine. All identified publications were considered, and those meeting the objectives of this review were included. RESULTS: Nelarabine, a soluble prodrug of 9-beta-D- arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G), is a novel purine antimetabolite antineoplastic that preferentially accumulates in T-cells. Ara-G is rapidly phosphorylated in T-cells to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), which exerts cytotoxic effects. Renal elimination of ara-G is decreased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended. Accumulation of ara-GTP occurs in T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, leading to preferential cytotoxicity. Nelarabine has activity in T-cell malignancies, as evaluated in 2 Phase I and 5 Phase II studies. It received accelerated approval from the FDA based on the resuits of 2 Phase II trials, one in pediatric patients (PGAA 2001) and the other in adults (CALGB 19801). In PGAA 2001, patients with T-ALL in first relapse (n = 33) had an objective response rate of 55% (16 with a complete response [CR] and 2 with a partial response [PR]), and those with T-ALL in second relapse (n = 30) had an objective response rate of 27% (7 CR and 1 PR). Among patients with central nervous system-positive T-ALL or T-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (T-NHL) (n = 21), 33% had an objective response (5 CR and 2 PR); among patients with T-ALL or T-NHL with extramedullary relapse (n = 22), 14% had a PR. CALGB 19801 included 39 adult patients with T-cell malignancies, of whom 7 (18%) had a CR and an additional 2 (5%) had a CR without full hematologic recovery. The recommended dose of nelarabine in adults is 1500 mg/m(2) IV given over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, repeated every 21 days; the recommended dose in pediatric patients is 650 mg/m(2) IV given over 1 hour for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicities observed in the Phase I and II trials included central and peripheral neurotoxicity. Symptoms of central neurotoxicity included somnolence, seizures, dizziness, confusion, and ataxia; symptoms of peripheral neurotoxicity included paresthesias, pain in the extremities, and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Nelarabine is indicated for the treatment of T-ALL and T-LBL that has not responded to or has relapsed after treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. Objective response rates in Phase II clinical trials of nelarabine have ranged from 11% to 60%. Use of nelarabine is limited by potentially severe neurotoxicity.""",1

567,24330075,Signalling properties and pharmacology of a 5-HT7 -type serotonin receptor from Tribolium castaneum,"In the last decade, genome sequence data and gene structure information on invertebrate receptors has been greatly expanded by large sequencing projects and cloning studies. This information is of great value for the identification of receptors; however, functional and pharmacological data are necessary for an accurate receptor classification and for practical applications. In insects, an important group of neurotransmitter and neurohormone receptors, for which ample sequence information is available but pharmacological information is missing, are the biogenic amine G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the present study, we investigated the sequence information, pharmacology and signalling properties of a 5-HT7 -type serotonin receptor from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Trica5-HT7 ). The receptor encoding cDNA shows considerable sequence similarity with cognate 5-HT7 receptors and phylogenetic analysis also clusters the receptor within this 5-HT receptor group. Real-time reverse transcription PCR demonstrated high expression levels in the brain, indicating the possible importance of this receptor in neural processes. Trica5-HT7 was dose-dependently activated by 5-HT, which induced elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels but had no effect on calcium signalling. The synthetic agonists, α-methyl 5-HT, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-carboxamidotryptamine and 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide, showed a response, although with a much lower potency and efficacy than 5-HT. Ketanserin and methiothepin were the most potent antagonists. Both showed characteristics of competitive inhibition on Trica5-HT7 . The signalling pathway and pharmacological profile offer important information that will facilitate functional and comparative studies of 5-HT receptors in insects and other invertebrates. The pharmacology of invertebrate 5-HT receptors differs considerably from that of vertebrates. The present study may therefore contribute to establishing a more reliable classification of invertebrate 5-HT receptors.  ",0
568,9920954,"""Do """"America's Best Hospitals"""" perform better for acute myocardial infarction?""","""BACKGROUND: """"America's Best Hospitals,"""" an influential list published annually by U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential use of recommended therapies. METHODS: Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of therapy to short-term mortality. RESULTS: Admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Admission to a hospital ranked high on the list of """"America's Best Hospitals"""" was associated with lower 30-day mortality among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. A substantial portion of the survival advantage may be associated with these hospitals' higher rates of use of aspirin and beta-blocker therapy.""",0
569,21049473,"Type 2 diabetes in mice induces hepatic overexpression of sulfatase 2, a novel factor that suppresses uptake of remnant lipoproteins","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impairs hepatic clearance of atherogenic postprandial remnant lipoproteins. Our work and that of others have identified syndecan-1 heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as remnant lipoprotein receptors. Nevertheless, defects in the T2DM liver have not been molecularly characterized, and neither has the correction that occurs upon caloric restriction. We used microarrays to compare expression of proteoglycan-related genes in livers from control db/m mice; obese, T2DM db/db littermates fed ad libitum (AL); and db/db mice pair-fed to match the intake of db/m mice. Surprisingly, the arrays identified only one gene whose dysregulation by T2DM would disrupt HSPG structure: the heparan sulfate glucosamine-6-O-endosulfatase-2 (Sulf2). SULF2 degrades HSPGs by removing 6-O sulfate groups, but had no previously known role in diabetes or lipoprotein biology. Follow-up quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays revealed a striking 11-fold induction of Sulf2 messenger RNA in the livers of AL T2DM mice compared with controls. Immunoblots demonstrated induction of SULF2 in AL livers, with restoration toward normal in livers from pair-fed db/db mice. Knockdown of SULF2 in cultured hepatocytes doubled HSPG-mediated catabolism of model remnant lipoproteins. Notably, co-immunoprecipitations revealed a persistent physical association of SULF2 with syndecan-1. To identify mechanisms of SULF2 dysregulation in T2DM, we found that advanced glycosylation end products provoked a 10-fold induction in SULF2 expression by cultured hepatocytes and an approximately 50% impairment in their catabolism of remnants and very low-density lipoprotein, an effect that was entirely reversed by SULF2 knockdown. Adiponectin and insulin each suppressed SULF2 protein in cultured liver cells and in murine livers in vivo, consistent with a role in energy flux. Likewise, both hormones enhanced remnant lipoprotein catabolism in vitro. CONCLUSION: SULF2 is an unexpected suppressor of atherogenic lipoprotein clearance by hepatocytes and an attractive target for inhibition.",0

571,24071493,Interventional oncology in the elderly: complications and early response in liver and kidney malignancies,"The complication rate, loco-regional responses and length of hospital stay were analyzed in patients with liver and kidney cancer older than 70years treated with interventional oncology procedures. The findings from the older population were compared with the younger patients (<70years) to detect any difference not related to chance. Prospectively collected data on patients who underwent hepatic artery embolization (with or without radiofrequency ablation) and kidney radiofrequency ablation were retrospectively analyzed. Complication rates, loco-regional responses and length of hospital stay for patients older and younger than 70 were compared. 163 patients were treated, 66 (40.5%) older and 97 (59.5%) younger than 70years. The complication rate in patients older than 70 was 4.5% (3/66 pts) versus 3.1% (3/97 pts) (p=0.69) in the younger age-group. The complication rates for the liver embolization group, liver embolization plus radiofrequency and kidney radiofrequency group were 2/90 pts (2.2%), 2/42 pts (4.8%) and 2/31 pts (6.5%), respectively (p=0.46). Median hospital stay was three nights in both older and younger patients. Response rates were not significantly influenced by age. Liver embolization with or without radiofrequency and renal radiofrequency are safe and effective in older patients. Age alone should not be considered a contraindication to treatment in carefully selected patients. ",0
572,26327301,"A phase 2, open-label, multicenter study of the long-term safety of siltuximab (an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody) in patients with multicentric Castleman disease","BACKGROUND: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a rare, systemic lymphoproliferative disorder driven by interleukin (IL)-6 overproduction. Siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable tumor and symptomatic responses in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study of MCD. METHODS: This preplanned safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of siltuximab treatment among 19 patients with MCD who had stable disease or better and were enrolled in a phase-1 study and subsequent ongoing, open-label, phase-2 extension study. Dosing was 11 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks, per protocol, or every 6 weeks at the investigator's discretion. Safety monitoring focused on potential risks associated with the anti-IL-6 mechanism of action. Investigator-assessed disease control status was also documented. RESULTS: Median treatment duration for the 19 patients was 5.1 (range 3.4, 7.2) years, with 14 (74%) patients treated for >4 years. Grade-? 3 adverse events (AEs) reported in >1 patient included hypertension (n = 3) and nausea, cellulitis, and fatigue (n = 2 each). Grade-? 3 AEs at least possibly attributed to siltuximab were leukopenia, lymphopenia, and a serious AE of polycythemia (n = 1 each). Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol) were reported in 8 and 9 patients, respectively. No disease relapses were observed, and 8 of 19 patients were able to switch to an every-6-week dosing schedule. CONCLUSIONS: All MCD patients in this extension study have received siltuximab for a prolonged duration (up to 7 years) without evidence of cumulative toxicity or treatment discontinuations and with few serious infections. All patients are alive, demonstrate sustained disease control, and continue to receive siltuximab.",1
573,22614989,Management of immune-related adverse events and kinetics of response with ipilimumab,"""Monoclonal antibodies directed against the immune checkpoint protein cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152)-ipilimumab and tremelimumab-have been investigated in metastatic melanoma and other cancers and have shown promising results. Recently, ipilimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We review the literature on managing the adverse effects and kinetics of tumor regression with ipilimumab and provide guidelines on their management. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique set of adverse effects may occur, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These include rashes, which may rarely progress to life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis, and colitis, characterized by a mild to moderate, but occasionally also severe and persistent diarrhea. Hypophysitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, iridocyclitis, lymphadenopathy, neuropathies, and nephritis have also been reported with ipilimumab. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of sequelae. Interestingly, irAEs correlated with treatment response in some studies. Unique kinetics of response have been observed with CTLA-4 blockade with at least four patterns: (1) response in baseline lesions by week 12, with no new lesions seen; (2) stable disease, followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden; (3) regression of tumor after initial increase in total tumor burden; and (4) reduction in total tumor burden during or after the appearance of new lesion(s) after week 12. We provide a detailed description of irAEs and recommendations for practicing oncologists who are managing them, along with the unusual kinetics of response associated with ipilimumab therapy.""",1
574,23823346,Effect of pH values of two bleaching gels on enamel microhardness,"This study evaluated the influence of bleaching gel pH and the effect of remineralizing gels after bleaching in different time intervals. Sixty bovine incisors were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Group 1 was bleached with a 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) acid gel and Group 2 was bleached with a 35% HP neutral gel. Each group was then divided into 3 subgroups (n = 10) according to the post-bleaching treatment used: storage in artificial saliva, application of a fluoride gel, or application of a gel consisting of fluoride, potassium nitrate, and nanostructured calcium phosphate. Specimens were stored in artificial saliva, and enamel microhardness was evaluated at 24 hours and 15 days postbleaching. Vickers microhardness data were analyzed by means of 2-way ANOVA, with repeated measurements and Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Twenty-four hours after bleaching, no significant differences were found between the bleaching gels. At 15 days postbleaching, Group 2 samples demonstrated a significant reduction in microhardness. No significant differences were found between the remineralizing gels, though all of the postbleaching treatments after the use of 35% neutral gel were able to re-establish baseline microhardness. It was concluded that neutral bleaching gel significantly reduced enamel microhardness 15 days after bleaching and that the use of remineralizing gels did not significantly enhance the microhardness of bleached enamel. However, in clinical situations, the acquired enamel pellicle protects tooth surfaces, and postbleaching, decalcified enamel would undergo recalcification. This study indicates that it is important to consider the bleaching agent's pH and composition when treating patients with reduced salivary secretion.  ",0
575,16034011,"Quality of care in U.S. hospitals as reflected by standardized measures, 2002-2004","BACKGROUND: In July 2002, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations implemented standardized performance measures that were designed to track the performance of accredited hospitals and encourage improvement in the quality of health care. METHODS: We examined hospitals' performance on 18 standardized indicators of the quality of care for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. One measure assessed a clinical outcome (death in the hospital after acute myocardial infarction), and the other 17 measures assessed processes of care. Data were collected over a two-year period in more than 3000 accredited hospitals. All participating hospitals received quarterly feedback in the form of comparative reports throughout the study. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed a significant improvement (P<0.01) in the performance of U.S. hospitals on 15 of 18 measures, and no measure showed a significant deterioration. The magnitude of improvement ranged from 3 percent to 33 percent during the eight quarters studied. For 16 of the 17 process-of-care measures, hospitals with a low level of performance at baseline had greater improvements over the subsequent two years than hospitals with a high level of performance at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Over a two-year period, we observed consistent improvement in measures reflecting the process of care for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Both quantitative and qualitative research are needed to explore the reasons for these improvements.",0
576,17287479,"Religion, conscience, and controversial clinical practices","BACKGROUND: There is a heated debate about whether health professionals may refuse to provide treatments to which they object on moral grounds. It is important to understand how physicians think about their ethical rights and obligations when such conflicts emerge in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a stratified, random sample of 2000 practicing U.S. physicians from all specialties by mail. The primary criterion variables were physicians' judgments about their ethical rights and obligations when patients request a legal medical procedure to which the physician objects for religious or moral reasons. These procedures included administering terminal sedation in dying patients, providing abortion for failed contraception, and prescribing birth control to adolescents without parental approval. RESULTS: A total of 1144 of 1820 physicians (63%) responded to our survey. On the basis of our results, we estimate that most physicians believe that it is ethically permissible for doctors to explain their moral objections to patients (63%). Most also believe that physicians are obligated to present all options (86%) and to refer the patient to another clinician who does not object to the requested procedure (71%). Physicians who were male, those who were religious, and those who had personal objections to morally controversial clinical practices were less likely to report that doctors must disclose information about or refer patients for medical procedures to which the physician objected on moral grounds (multivariate odds ratios, 0.3 to 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians do not consider themselves obligated to disclose information about or refer patients for legal but morally controversial medical procedures. Patients who want information about and access to such procedures may need to inquire proactively to determine whether their physicians would accommodate such requests.",0
577,28952425,Reduction of acrylamide in whole-wheat bread by combining lactobacilli and yeast fermentation,"This study mainly focuses on a strategy for reducing acrylamide content in whole-wheat bread by combining lactobacilli and yeast in sourdough breadmaking. Combinations of sourdough (fermented dough using different Lactobacillus strains including Lactobacillus plantarum PTCC 1896 [probiotic], L. sakei DSM 20,017, L. rhamnosus DSM 20,021, and L. delbrueckii DSM 20,081) and yeast, in comparison with yeast alone, were used for breadmaking. The results showed that acrylamide levels in breads fermented using sourdough+yeast were in all cases much lower (6.9-20 μg/kg on a dry weight basis [d.b.]) than those in the yeast-only fermented bread (47.6 μg/kg d.b.). Significant (p < 0.05) correlations were also found between pH, total titratable acids (TTA) and lactic acid, and acrylamide content. Furthermore, the obtained results showed that the moisture content of dough directly influenced the formation of acrylamide in bread (r = 0.925, p < 0.0001). In addition, no significant correlations were observed between acrylamide content in breads and either the reducing sugar or free amino acid contents in dough samples. According to the different effects of Lactobacillus strains, it could be concluded that the acrylamide reducing potential of lactobacilli was strain-specific, with L. rhamnosus being the most effective. This suggests that sourdough fermentation with appropriate Lactobacillus strains can be used as an advantageous technology to reduce the acrylamide content of whole-wheat breads. ",0

Soil artificially-spiked with chlorobenzenes (CBs) was amended with either PAC or GAC to obtain an application rate of 1%. The results showed that the dissipation and volatilization of CBs from the amended soil significantly decreased compared to the unamended soil. The bioavailabilities of CBs, which is expressed as butanol extraction and earthworm accumulation, were significantly reduced in PAC and GAC amended soils. The lower chlorinated and hence more volatile CBs experienced higher reductions in both dissipation and bioavailability in the amended soils. The GAC and PAC equally immobilized more volatile CBs in soil. Therefore, it could be concluded that along with environmental implication, applying GAC was the more promising approach for the effective immobilization of volatile compounds in soil.  ",0
580,1530977,D1 receptor stimulation inhibits dopamine cell activity after reserpine treatment but not after chronic SCH 23390: an effect blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists,"Single unit recordings were conducted to examine the effects of systemic D1 agonist SKF 38393 on the firing rate of substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine (DA) neurons in rats pretreated subchronically with reserpine or chronically with a D1 antagonist. The effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists on these processes was also investigated. An i.v. injection of SKF 38393 (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited DA cell activity by approximately 70% in rats pretreated with reserpine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) for 6 days and studied under conditions of local anesthesia. SKF 38393 exerted no effect in reserpinized rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The SKF 38393-induced inhibition was reversed by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, but not by the preferential D2 antagonist haloperidol. This effect of SKF 38393 was observed in 60% of the rats as early as 3 to 8 hr after the first reserpine injection, and the inhibition remained significant 5 to 15 days (averaging 64 and 58%) after termination of the 6-day reserpine treatment. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists ketamine, at anesthetic doses (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and MK 801, at a nonanesthetic dose (0.15 mg/kg, i.v.), completely blocked the inhibitory effect of SKF 38393. In contrast, DA cells recorded in rats pretreated with SCH 23390 for 7 to 21 days, followed by a 4-day washout period, failed to respond to SKF 38393. Because nigrostriatal DA neurons do not appear to express D1 receptors, these results suggest that D1 receptors can exert an indirect inhibitory effect on the activity of nigral DA neurons, presumably through striatonigral neuronal pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0

586,25970010,"X-linked TEX11 mutations, meiotic arrest, and azoospermia in infertile men","BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of nonobstructive azoospermia is unknown in the majority of infertile men. METHODS: We performed array comparative genomic hybridization testing in blood samples obtained from 15 patients with azoospermia, and we performed mutation screening by means of direct Sanger sequencing of the testis-expressed 11 gene (TEX11) open reading frame in blood and semen samples obtained from 289 patients with azoospermia and 384 controls. RESULTS: We identified a 99-kb hemizygous loss on chromosome Xq13.2 that involved three TEX11 exons. This loss, which was identical in 2 patients with azoospermia, predicts a deletion of 79 amino acids within the meiosis-specific sporulation domain SPO22. Our subsequent mutation screening showed five novel TEX11 mutations: three splicing mutations and two missense mutations. These mutations, which occurred in 7 of 289 men with azoospermia (2.4%), were absent in 384 controls with normal sperm concentrations (P=0.003). Notably, five of those TEX11 mutations were detected in 33 patients (15%) with azoospermia who received a diagnosis of azoospermia with meiotic arrest. Meiotic arrest in these patients resembled the phenotype of Tex11-deficient male mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed specific cytoplasmic TEX11 expression in late spermatocytes, as well as in round and elongated spermatids, in normal human testes. In contrast, testes of patients who had azoospermia with TEX11 mutations had meiotic arrest and lacked TEX11 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, hemizygous TEX11 mutations were a common cause of meiotic arrest and azoospermia in infertile men. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).",0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year study, 188 postmenopausal women, aged 42 to 75 years, with low bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 daily treatment groups: placebo for 2 years, alendronate 5 or 10 mg for 2 years, alendronate 20 or 40 mg for 1 year followed by placebo for 1 year, or alendronate 40 mg for 3 months followed by 2.5 mg for 21 months. All subjects were given 500 mg/d of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate. RESULTS: At each dose, alendronate produced significant reductions in markers of bone resorption and formation, and significantly increased bone mass at the lumbar spine, hip, and total body, as compared with decreases (significant at lumbar spine) in subjects receiving placebo. In the 10-mg group, mean urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine had declined by 47% at 3 months, and mean serum osteocalcin by 53% at 6 months. Mean changes in BMD over 24 months with 10 mg alendronate were +7.21% +/- 0.49% for the lumbar spine, +5.27% +/- 0.70% for total hip, and +2.53% +/- 0.68% for total body (each P < 0.01) compared to changes of -1.35% +/- 0.61%, -1.20% +/- 0.64% and -0.31% +/- 0.44% at these sites, respectively, with placebo treatment. Progressive increases in BMD of both lumbar spine and total hip were observed in the second year of treatment with 10 mg alendronate (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Alendronate, a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, reduces markers of bone remodeling and significantly increases BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and total body, and is well tolerated at therapeutic doses (5 or 10 mg daily) in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",1

592,20160715,Changes in liver biochemistry during methotrexate use for inflammatory bowel disease,"""OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the spectrum of liver enzyme test (LET) abnormalities that occur while using methotrexate for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of subjects using methotrexate for IBD at a single center. The clinical and epidemiological parameters, and hepatotoxicity risk factors, were recorded. Subjects were excluded if cumulative methotrexate doses could not be ascertained, if they had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, or if baseline and follow-up LETs were not available. Also noted were the cumulative methotrexate dose during the peak LET increase, severity of LET increase, and whether normalization occurred. RESULTS: Eighty-seven subjects were included (Crohn's disease, n=67; UC, n=17; indeterminate colitis n=3). The mean therapy duration was 81 weeks (3- to 364-week range), and the cumulative average dose was 1,813 mg (25-8,255-mg range). Thirty-seven (43%) subjects received a cumulative dose >1,500 mg. Sixty-seven (77%) had normal LETs, and in 51 (76%) LETs remained normal throughout methotrexate therapy. In the 16 (24%) who developed LET abnormalities, seven (44%) had underlying risk factor(s) for liver disease. Normalization (without dose reduction) occurred in 14 (88%) while continuing methotrexate. Of 20 subjects with abnormal LETs at baseline, nine (45%) subsequently normalized while continuing methotrexate, whereas nine (45%) worsened. Seventeen liver biopsies were performed in 11 and were classified as Roenigk's grade I in 15 (88%) subjects. Roenigk IIIb or IV was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate is commonly associated with LET abnormalities, but these frequently normalize while still on therapy, and in only 5% will drug discontinuation be necessary. Liver biopsies rarely have substantive abnormalities.""",1
593,16231956,The safety profile of sustained release paracetamol during therapeutic use and following overdose,"""Sustained release (SR) formulations of paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been introduced in several countries to provide lasting pain relief and reduced risk of rebound pain. However, few studies have evaluated the safety of paracetamol SR formulations. To assess the available published safety data regarding SR formulations of paracetamol, the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched from 1980 to June 2003 for published worldwide human experience with paracetamol SR formulations. All publications that included any information about ingestion of any paracetamol SR formulation were systematically reviewed and abstracted by trained staff. The literature searches returned a total of 14 references containing safety data on paracetamol SR. In addition, the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) database was searched for human exposure cases. The TESS database yielded 3003 cases from 1994 to 2002 that involved a paracetamol SR product. The available information indicates that the adverse event and safety profile of paracetamol SR is very similar to immediate release (IR) formulations of paracetamol. During therapeutic use, minor effects such as gastrointestinal upset and headache may occur. The rate of these effects varies substantially among studies but overall does not appear to be different between the SR and IR formulations of paracetamol. Overdose with paracetamol SR is expected to cause liver injury similar to overdose with IR formulations. The number of human exposure cases has increased since introduction of the SR formulation; however, sales of the SR formulation amounted to 7.5% of all paracetamol sales but accounted for 2.5% of the cases reported to poison centres. There were two deaths recorded in the TESS database: both were the result of multiple drug ingestion. No cases of death or unusual types of toxicity have been described from an overdose of paracetamol SR alone.""",1
594,7664693,A cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase activity is induced by follicle stimulating hormone and insulin like growth factor-I in human granulosa cells,"Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) induces estradiol (E2) production in rat, porcine and human granulosa cells with a concomitant increase in cAMP. In human granulosa cells insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induces E2 production without cAMP accumulation. In the current study we report that IGF-I and FSH effects on aromatase activity both involve activation of a cytosolic soluble protein tyrosine kinase (CytPTK). This FSH and IGF-I stimulated CytPTK activity was blocked by AG-82 (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and by staurosporine (STS) (a non specific protein kinase inhibitor) at concentrations which inhibited E2 production. These new findings strengthen the concept of fail-safe mechanism in E2 production in human granulosa cells by an involvement of tyrosine kinase(s) activity downstream of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation.

595,29898728,Trimester-specific phthalate concentrations and glucose levels among women from a fertility clinic,"Subfertile women are at increased risk of glucose intolerance in pregnancy. Based on epidemiologic studies, exposure to certain phthalates is associated with diabetes, elevated glucose, and increased insulin resistance. To evaluate the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and pregnancy glucose levels in women seeking medically assisted reproduction. We evaluated 245 women participating in a prospective cohort study based at a large fertility clinic who delivered live births and had data on pregnancy urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and blood glucose levels. Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were from single spot urine samples collected in 1st and 2nd trimesters. Blood glucose data was abstracted from medical records for non-fasting 50-g glucose challenge tests at 24-28 weeks gestation. Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between 7 urinary phthalate metabolites in quartiles and mean glucose adjusted for potential confounders. Eighteen percent of women had glucose levels ≥ 140 mg/dL. Second trimester monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations were positively associated with glucose levels, with adjusted mean (95%CI) glucose levels of 121 mg/dl (114, 128) vs. 109 mg/dL (103, 116) for women in highest and lowest quartiles, respectively. Women in the highest quartile of second trimester mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) concentrations had a mean glucose level 14 mg/dL lower compared to women in the lowest quartile. No other urinary phthalate metabolites were associated with glucose levels. MEP and MiBP-metabolites of diethyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate, respectively-were associated with higher pregnancy glucose in subfertile women-a population at high risk of glucose intolerance in pregnancy.

596,180859,Editorial: Systemic contraceptives and liver tumors,"Since 1973 more than 100 cases of benign liver tumors occuring in association with oral contraceptive (OC) use have been reported. These tumors have varied in histologic appearance. Recent reports have identified 5 women with hepatocellular carcinoma nad 1 with hepatoblastoma occurring in association with use of systemic contraceptives. Before 1960 these tumors were rare. There are probably a larger number of unrecognized cases as many patients with these tumors have been asymptomatic. A significant difference in duration of OC use by patients and controls has been noted (p more than .01). The mean duration of OC use of 6 years before clinical appearance of liver cell adrenomas has been determined. The number of women entering the high-risk group for formation of liver cell adenomas may increase in the future. Unresectable tumors have been observed to decrease in size when OCs habe been discontinued and such tumors have recurred in patients in whom OC use was continued after resection. Other factors may also be important. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) has instituted an epidemiologic survey that will review cases of hepatocellular tumors occurring in young women. Physicians may refer documented cases to Dr. Kamal G. Ishak at AFIP in Washington, D.C. A national registry for these tumors is recommended to establish the magnitude of the problem. Basic research into the effects of OCs on liver structure is needed. Funding agencies are urged to cooperate.",1
597,1710779,Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and the risk of subsequent fetal death,"BACKGROUND: The finding of an elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester of pregnancy may indicate that the fetus has died or is about to die. It is uncertain, however, whether the finding is associated with an increased risk of fetal death later in gestation independent of known causes of elevation, such as the presence of neural-tube defects or multiple gestation. METHODS: To address this question, we performed a case-control study of 612 women whose pregnancies ended in fetal death and 2501 women who gave birth to live infants, using reports from California vital statistics for 1987. All the women had signleton pregnancies and alpha-fetoprotein screening in the second trimester. RESULTS: Women with elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of fetal death, and the risk was increased until term. Women with the highest levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein--greater than or equal to 3.0 times the median value--had a very high risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 22.0) as compared with women who had normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels that were 2.0 to 2.9 times the median were also associated with an elevated risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.4). Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein were especially likely to be associated with fetal death in cases in which maternal hypertension or placental infarction was also present. CONCLUSIONs. An unexplained elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent fetal death, up to four to five months after alpha-fetoprotein screening.",0

Metabolization of the non-conventional thiopurine 6-thioguanine does not generate 6-methyl mercaptopurine. Hence, the aim of our study was to evaluate hepatotoxicity during 6-thioguanine in IBD patients who previously failed conventional thiopurines due to 6-methyl mercaptopurine associated hepatotoxicity. METHODS: A retrospective single center intercept cohort study was performed of IBD patients using 6-thioguanine between January 2006 and July 2010 after failing conventional thiopurine therapy due to 6-methyl mercaptopurine associated hepatotoxicity. The primary outcome was the occurrence of 6-thioguanine induced hepatotoxicity, scaled according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included. Median duration of 6-thioguanine therapy (median daily dosage 21 mg (9-24)) was 23 weeks (6-96). Hepatotoxicity did not reoccur in 15 out of 19, whereas grade 1 toxicity persisted in 4 patients (p<0.001). Median aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations decreased from 34 U/l (20-59) and 64 U/l (15-175) to 23 U/l (18-40; p=0.003) and 20 U/l (14-48; p=0.019), respectively. CONCLUSION: Hepatotoxicity does not reoccur during 6-thioguanine treatment in most IBD patients who failed conventional thiopurines due to 6-methyl mercaptopurine associated hepatotoxicity. Hence, at least at short-term, 6-thioguanine appears a justifiable alternative thiopurine for these IBD patients.""",1
599,25582431,Infection with Helicobacter bilis but not Helicobacter hepaticus was Associated with Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma,"The biliary tract cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents the sixth leading cause of gastrointestinal tumors in the Western world, and mortality varies across the world, with regions such as Chile, Thailand, Japan, and northeastern India presenting the highest rates. CCA may develop in the bile duct, gallbladder, or ampulla of Vater; and risk factors include obesity, parity, genetic background, geographical and environmental factors. Inflammation induced by bacterial infections might play a role in the pathogenesis of CCA. In this work, we investigated whether there is an association between extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECCA) and infection with S. typhi, H. hepaticus, or H. bilis in a Mexican population. A total of 194 patients were included and divided into 91 patients with benign biliary pathology (controls) and 103 with ECCA (cases). Tumor samples were taken during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by biliary brushing, followed by DNA extraction and PCR testing for infections. We found that 44/103 cases were positive for H. bilis, compared with 19/91 controls (p = 0.002; OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.49-5.32), and when analyzed by sub-site, H. bilis infection was significantly more associated with cancer in the common bile duct (p = 0.0005; OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.77-7.17). In contrast, H. hepaticus infection was not different between cases (17/103) and controls (13/91) (p = 0.82; OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.54-2.60). None of the samples were positive for S. typhi infection. In conclusion, infection with H. bilis but neither H. Hepaticus nor S. typhi was significantly associated with ECCA, particularly with tumors located in the common bile duct. ",0
600,25005844,An analysis of the safety profile of proteasome inhibitors for treating various cancers,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence demonstrates that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a promising target for cancer therapy. Bortezomib (Velcade) exhibits great efficacy against multiple myeloma (MM) since the first clinical application. However, there are still several limitations associated with the use of bortezomib, including severe toxicities. To overcome bortezomib's shortcomings and to improve its safety profile, several second-generation proteasome inhibitors, for example, carfilzomib, ixazomib, oprozomib and marizomib, have been developed and currently tested in various clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: A literature search was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar. The activity and safety profiling of proteasome inhibitors in treatment of various cancers were reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Bortezomib, as a single or in combination therapy, demonstrates efficacy against MM or other hematological malignancies in clinical settings. However, it encounters two major problems, the acquired resistance and the severe side effects. Future direction in bortezomib-based therapy should focus on how to increase or retain its efficacy but improve its safety profile through, for example, rational combination therapies. Second-generation proteasome inhibitors have shown benefits in both overcoming bortezomib resistance and reducing related side effects, although these encouraging results should be further confirmed in a larger clinic population.",1
601,16950959,Detection of acetaminophen protein adducts in children with acute liver failure of indeterminate cause,"OBJECTIVE: Acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts are a widely recognized correlate of acetaminophen-mediated hepatic injury in laboratory animals. The objective of this study was to use a new assay for the detection of acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts in children with acute liver failure to determine the role of acetaminophen toxicity in acute liver failure of unknown cause. METHODS: Serum samples from children with acute liver failure were measured for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. For comparison, samples from children with well-characterized acetaminophen toxicity and children with known other causes of acute liver failure also were measured for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts. The analytical laboratory was blinded to patient diagnoses. RESULTS: Acetaminophen cysteine protein adduct was detected in 90% of samples from children with acute liver failure that was attributed to acetaminophen toxicity, 12.5% of samples from children with acute liver failure of indeterminate cause, and 9.6% of samples from children with acute liver failure that was attributed to other causes. Adduct-positive patients from the indeterminate cause subgroup had higher levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and lower levels of bilirubin. Adduct-positive patients also had lower rates of transplantation and higher rates of spontaneous remission. CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant percentage of children with acute liver failure of indeterminate cause tested positive for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts, strongly suggesting acetaminophen toxicity as the cause of acute liver failure. An assay for the detection of acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts can aid the diagnosis of acetaminophen-related liver injury in children.",1

604,24442596,Arterial and fat tissue inflammation are highly correlated: a prospective 18F-FDG PET/CT study,"There is evidence that the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease might relate to inflammation in both fat tissue and the arterial wall. (18)F-FDG uptake on PET is a surrogate marker of vessel wall inflammation. The aim of the study was to measure FDG uptake in both regions using PET and identify links between adipose and arterial inflammation. Included in the study were 173 cardiovascular patients who were prospectively imaged with FDG PET/CT. Arterial FDG uptake was measured in the carotid arteries and ascending aorta. The same was done in fat tissue in the neck, the presternal region (both subcutaneous) and the pericardium. FDG uptake was quantified as average maximal target-to-background ratio (mean TBR max). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify significant associations between arterial and adipose tissue FDG uptake and clinical variables as given by the standardized correlation coefficient (β). FDG uptake values in all fat tissue regions were highly predictive of vascular FDG uptake in both the carotids (β 0.262, p < 0.0001, in the neck subcutaneous region) and aorta (β 0.22, p = 0.008, in the chest pericardial region; β 0.193, p = 0.019, in the chest subcutaneous region). Obesity was significantly associated with elevated FDG uptake in adipose tissue (β 0.470, p < 0.0001, in the neck subcutaneous region; β 0.619, p = 0.028, in the chest subcutaneous region; β 0.978, p = 0.035, in the chest pericardial region). FDG uptake in diverse fat tissue regions was significantly associated with arterial FDG uptake, a reasonable surrogate of inflammation. Increasing body weight significantly predicted the level of fatty inflammation. FDG PET therefore provides imaging evidence of an inflammatory link between fat tissue and the vasculature in patients with cardiovascular disease. ",0

METHODS: Eligible T2D patients undergoing treatment with diet control only or oral antidiabetic medications were run-in on acarbose 50mg thrice-daily for 4 weeks, then randomised either to continue this monotherapy, or to acarbose 50mg plus metformin hydrochloride 500mg FDC (acarbose/metformin FDC), each thrice-daily for 16 weeks. RESULTS: Acarbose/metformin FDC therapy significantly reduced HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) from baseline (all p<0.0001) with superior efficacy compared with acarbose monotherapy (between-group differences; HbA1c -1.35%; FPG -29.5mg/dl; PPG -41.6mg/dl; all p<0.0001). Proportionally more patients treated with acarbose/metformin FDC achieved HbA1c <7.0% (47.8% vs. 10.7%, p<0.0001). Both treatments reduced bodyweight (p<0.0001), with a significant between-group difference (-0.6kg, p<0.01) favouring acarbose/metformin FDC. Hypoglycaemia was not reported with either treatment, and the incidence of other adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with acarbose monotherapy, acarbose/metformin FDC has superior antihyperglycaemic efficacy, brings proportionally more T2D patients to HbA1c goal, and further reduces bodyweight. Acarbose/metformin FDC is well-tolerated without significant risk of hypoglycaemia and is a potentially advantageous therapy for T2D.""",1

We investigated the association between gene methylation and recurrence of the tumor. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent curative resection but who had a recurrence within 40 months after resection (case patients) were matched on the basis of age, NSCLC stage, sex, and date of surgery to 116 patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent curative resection but who did not have a recurrence within 40 months after resection (controls). We investigated whether the methylation of seven genes in tumor and lymph nodes was associated with tumor recurrence. RESULTS: In a multivariate model, promoter methylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene p16, the H-cadherin gene CDH13, the Ras association domain family 1 gene RASSF1A, and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene APC in tumors and in histologically tumor-negative lymph nodes was associated with tumor recurrence, independently of NSCLC stage, age, sex, race, smoking history, and histologic characteristics of the tumor. Methylation of the promoter regions of p16 and CDH13 in both tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes was associated with an odds ratio of recurrent cancer of 15.50 in the original cohort and an odds ratio of 25.25 when the original cohort was combined with an independent validation cohort of 20 patients with stage I NSCLC.

The workforce shortage can be attributed to both insufficient numbers and maldistribution of workers, leaving some communities with no behavioral health providers. In addition, demand for behavioral health services has increased more rapidly as a result of federal legislation over the past decade supporting mental health and substance use parity and by healthcare reform. In order to address workforce capacity issues that impact access to care, the field must engage in extensive planning; however, these efforts are limited by the lack of timely and useable data on the behavioral health workforce. One method for standardizing data collection efforts is the adoption of a Minimum Data Set. This article describes workforce data limitations, the need for standardizing data collection, and the development of a behavioral health workforce Minimum Data Set intended to address these gaps. The Minimum Data Set includes five categorical data themes to describe worker characteristics: demographics, licensure and certification, education and training, occupation and area of practice, and practice characteristics and settings. Some data sources align with Minimum Data Set themes, although deficiencies in the breadth and quality of data exist. Development of a Minimum Data Set is a foundational step for standardizing the collection of behavioral health workforce data. Key challenges for dissemination and implementation of the Minimum Data Set are also addressed.

Among the 25 patients (median age, 14 years; pre-B cell ALL, 84%; >/= 2 prior regimens: 84%; refractory to previous regimen: 60%), the overall response rate was 44% (7 CR, 4 CRp) with a 67.3-week median duration or remission censored at last follow-up. Most patients proceeded to alternative therapy, and 10 patients (40%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Six patients (24%) died because of treatment-related adverse events associated with infection, hepatotoxicity, and/or multiorgan failure. The study protocol was amended to exclude patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after 4 of the first 8 patients developed severe hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease. No additional cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred. The regimen offered encouraging response rates and sustained remission in R/R patients. Future investigation should include exploration of patient selection, dosing, and supportive care. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00315705.""",1
617,15068119,Lysophosphatidic acid modulates the regenerative responses of human gingival fibroblasts and enhances the actions of platelet-derived growth factor,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been used to promote healing in many in vitro and in vivo models of periodontal regeneration. PDGF is known to interact extensively with another platelet mediator, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), to enhance regenerative responses in non-oral systems. PDGF and LPA are both liberated by platelets in the blood clot, which is known to be critical in stabilizing early periodontal wound healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the basic interactions of LPA with primary human gingival fibroblasts (GF) alone and with PDGF-BB for promoting GF growth and migration, as well as their effects in an in vitro oral wound-healing model. GF regenerative responses were measured using 1 and 10 microM LPA in the absence or presence of 1 or 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cell growth was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting. Migration responses were measured using a microchemotaxis chamber. For the in vitro wound-healing experiments, GF were grown to confluence on glass slides, and a 3 mm wide wound was mechanically inflicted. Percent wound fill on days 4, 6, and 9 was analyzed using computer-assisted histomorphometry. GF exhibited proliferative and chemotactic responses to LPA. These responses were synergistic when LPA and PDGF-BB were present together. LPA on its own did not stimulate statistically significant wound fill, but when combined with PDGF-BB, wound fill was equivalent to the 10% serum positive control group by day 6 (5.5-fold of negative control, [P<0.001]) and again on day 9 (6-fold of negative control, [P<0.001]). These studies provide the first evidence that LPA stimulates human GF regenerative responses and that it interacts positively with PDGF-BB to regulate these actions. The results suggest that LPA needs to be further investigated in the oral system as a factor that should be considered for incorporation when designing new periodontal wound-healing therapies using PDGF.

620,2442561,The safety and tolerability of lisinopril in clinical trials,"""The safety and tolerability of lisinopril were assessed in 1,476 patients [1,165 hypertensives and 311 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)] and 211 normal volunteers. The duration of lisinopril therapy ranged from 1 day to 16 months, with a mean duration of 105 days. In the hypertensive population, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences on lisinopril alone were headache, dizziness, cough, and diarrhea. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. Five percent of patients were discontinued because of adverse clinical experiences; cough and dizziness were the most common reasons for discontinuation. Two of 1,165 (0.17%) hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril died, compared to 0.41% of hypertensive patients on other therapies. Neither case was considered to be drug related. In patients with CHF, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences were dizziness, diarrhea, hypotension, fatigue, headache, and rash. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. The percent of CHF patients discontinuing because of an adverse clinical experience was 7.4%; the most frequent causes for discontinuation were hypotension, dizziness, or renal impairment. Twelve deaths occurred in 311 CHF patients treated with lisinopril (3.9%) compared to 4/104 (3.8%) of CHF patients treated with placebo and 2/65 (3.1%) treated with captopril. Hypotension, orthostatic effects, or dizziness following the initial lisinopril dose occurred infrequently in patients treated with lisinopril. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, including those treated previously or concomitantly with diuretic therapy, a first-dose hypotensive episode was reported in six of 955, or 0.6%. The incidence was higher (6.7%) in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",1

We describe three children who died at our institution after rapidly progressive clinical deterioration from this infection, with necrotizing pneumonia and multiple-organ-system involvement. The identification of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage at autopsy was characteristic of the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, a constellation of findings usually associated with fulminant meningococcemia. The close genetic relationship among the three responsible isolates of S. aureus, one susceptible to methicillin and two resistant to methicillin, underscores the close relationship between virulent methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates now circulating in the community.",0
622,15565659,Inhibition of T-cell responses by hepatic stellate cells via B7-H1-mediated T-cell apoptosis in mice,"In the injured liver, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) secrete many different cytokines, recruit lymphocytes, and thus participate actively in the pathogenesis of liver disease. Little is known of the role of HSCs in immune responses. In this study, HSCs isolated from C57BL/10 (H2b) mice were found to express scant key surface molecules in the quiescent stage. Activated HSCs express major histocompatibility complex class I, costimulatory molecules, and produce a variety of cytokines. Stimulation by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) or activated T cells enhanced expression of these molecules. Interestingly, addition of the activated (but not quiescent) HSCs suppressed thymidine uptake by T cells that were stimulated by alloantigens or by anti-CD3-mediated T-cell receptor ligation in a dose-dependent manner. High cytokine production by the T cells suggests that the inhibition was probably not a result of suppression of their activation. T-cell division was also found to be normal in a CFSE dilution assay. The HSC-induced T-cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with enhanced T-cell apoptosis. Activation of HSCs was associated with markedly enhanced expression of B7-H1. Blockade of B7-H1/PD-1 ligation significantly reduced HSC immunomodulatory activity, suggesting an important role of B7-H1. In conclusion, the bidirectional interactions between HSCs and immune cells may contribute to hepatic immune tolerance.",0
623,25097577,Efficacy and tolerability of 1- and 3-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations (Eligard(�)/Depo-Eligard(�)) for advanced prostate cancer in daily practice: a Belgian prospective non-interventional study,"INTRODUCTION: The 1-, 3- and 6- month biodegradable polymer matrix depot formulations of leuprorelin acetate (Eligard(�)/Depo-Eligard(�), Astellas Pharma Inc/BV) were shown to reduce testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels and to be well tolerated in patients with advanced prostate cancer in several clinical trials. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the 1- and 3-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations in daily clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, open-label, non-interventional, phase IV study (MANTA) was conducted in 243 Belgian prostate cancer patients who had been prescribed the 1-month (7.5 mg) or 3-month (22.5 mg) leuprorelin acetate depot formulation. Patients were followed for at least 3 months. RESULTS: Median serum prostate-specific antigen levels were reduced by 95% from 12.0 ng/ml at baseline to 0.60 ng/ml after a median follow-up time of 132 days, while median testosterone levels were reduced by 94% from 360 ng/dl to 20 ng/dl. Partial or complete treatment response was observed in 83% of patients at the final visit (according to the physician's assessment). Ninety-two patients (37.86%) experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, with injection site-related reactions, hot flushes and tumor flare being the most common ones. Overall safety and tolerability of the leuprorelin acetate depot formulation were rated as good or excellent by 90% of physicians. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with efficacy and tolerability results from clinical trials. They confirm that the 1- and 3-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations are well tolerated and reliably lower serum prostate-specific antigen and testosterone levels in routine clinical practice.",1

We show that this results in histone hypoacetylation at the promoter of PIGM. The histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate increases PIGM transcription and surface GPI expression in vitro as well as in vivo through enhanced histone acetylation in an Sp1-dependent manner. More important, the drug caused complete cessation of intractable seizures in a child with inherited GPI deficiency.",0
625,10051459,Anti-idiotypic antibodies to anti-PDC-E2 in primary biliary cirrhosis and normal subjects,"Anti-idiotypic antibodies may regulate the immune system and influence pathogenic autoimmunity. We investigated idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions in sera of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), normal subjects and animals immunized with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) or its derivatives. IgG autoantibody to the E2 subunit of PDC (PDC-E2) was derived by affinity-purification from sera of 12 patients with PBC, and F(ab)2 was prepared (anti-PDC-E2-F[ab]2). This was used as a reactant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with sera from patients with PBC, normal subjects, or immunized animals. Results were that IgG antibody to anti-PDC-E2-F(ab)2 was detectable at low concentration in 12 PBC sera (mean optical density [OD] +/- SD: 1.02 +/- 0.26), and also in 19 normal sera (mean OD +/- SD: 0.97 +/- 0. 35) using a serum dilution of 1:20; background OD was 0.09 to 0.10, whereas antisera from animals immunized with PDC or PDC-E2 were nonreactive. There was a significant inverse correlation (r = -.59, P =.04) between the levels of anti-PDC-E2 in PBC sera (but not normal sera), and anti-idiotypic antibody reactive with anti-PDC-E2-F(ab)2. Anti-idiotypic antibody existed as a complex with anti-PDC-E2, because the removal of anti-PDC-E2 from serum resulted in decreased reactivity to anti-PDC-E2-F(ab)2. Reactivity between PDC-E2 and anti-PDC-E2 from PBC serum was not inhibited by normal sera, indicating that anti-idiotypic antibody from normal sera with anti-PDC-E2 reacts with the framework of F(ab) rather than the paratope. The conclusions are that PBC and normal sera contain IgG class anti-idiotypic antibodies to anti-PDC-E2, the characteristic autoantibody in PBC. Anti-PDC-E2 in immunized animals does not contain an idiotype cross-reactive with human anti-PDC-E2. Anti-idiotypic antibody in PBC is complexed with anti-PDC-E2 and in part accounts for immune complexes demonstrable in PBC. Anti-idiotypic antibody in PBC may regulate levels of anti-PDC-E2.",0
626,25686220,Haemangiosarcoma of the os penis in a dog: The most common neoplasm of the canine penis,"A castrated 9-year-old intact male boerboel cross-breed dog was presented with a month-long history of stranguria. On physical examination, a mass was noted at the caudal extremity of the os penis. Haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis were all unremarkable. Abdominal and urethral ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged bladder and a dilated urethra, which was followed to the caudal extremity of the os penis. A hyperechoic, roughly spherical,vascularised mass was noted at the caudal os penis, which resulted in obstruction of the penile urethra. Radiographs demonstrated a soft tissue mass with osteolysis of the os penis. Cytology suggested an osteosarcoma. Treatment included amputation of the penis and adjuvant doxorubicin with carboplatin. Histopathology of the penis confirmed a haemangiosarcoma. The patient survived for 20 months. This is only the second published case report describing a penile haemangiosarcoma, and the first published report demonstrating the treatment and outcome of a case of haemangiosarcoma of the os penis. Based on published and unpublished reports, haemangiosarcoma appears to be the most common neoplasm of the canine penis. ",0
627,25419726,The promise of science-based training and application in psychological clinical science,"Baker, McFall, and Shoham (2008) analyzed and critiqued the state of training in clinical psychology, asserting that much of this training is not sufficiently influenced by science. They asserted that the emergent demands of health care, with its attendant costs and resource constraints, require that mental and behavioral health care become increasingly efficient, effective, and cost-effective. Baker et al. (2008) then offered examples of how science-based evidence and methods could influence training in clinical psychology to achieve those goals. Laska, Gurman, and Wampold (2014, pp. 467-481) critiqued aspects of the Baker et al. (2008) paper. In the current paper, we argue that Laska et al. (2014) misconstrued points made in the early Baker paper. We also assert that evidence of common factors in psychological interventions is in no way antithetical or problematic to a science-based approach to clinical training and application. Further, we argue for a multidimensional approach to evaluating intervention performance, one that involves an evaluation of efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, translation potential, and so on. Finally, we discuss how researchers can most efficiently develop intervention methods and delivery systems that are superior to the induction of common factors per se. ",0

629,19751861,The effects of hormonal contraceptive use among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: This report evaluates the effects of hormonal contraceptive use among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver. METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to June 2008 for publications that examined the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. In one study of acute hepatitis, combined oral contraceptive (COC) use did not affect duration of hospitalization or successful disease resolution. The remainder of the studies examined chronic hepatitis or its sequelae. Women recovered from hepatitis experienced transaminase elevation with COC use which resolved after 4 weeks in one study or increased slightly over 6 months in another study. Hepatitis B virus carriers using COCs had similar transaminase levels as nonusing carriers over 6 months. Studies of chronic hepatitis C infection demonstrated no influence of COC use on progression or severity of liver fibrosis or development of hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Data from one study suggest that COCs do not affect the course of acute hepatitis. Limited data from studies on chronic hepatitis or its sequelae suggest that COC use does not affect the rate of progression or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in women with chronic hepatitis, or the risk of liver dysfunction in hepatitis B virus carriers.",1
630,28236308,PRMT5 restricts hepatitis B virus replication through epigenetic repression of covalently closed circular DNA transcription and interference with pregenomic RNA encapsidation,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem worldwide. The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) minichromosome, which serves as the template for the transcription of viral RNAs, plays a key role in viral persistence. While accumulating evidence suggests that cccDNA transcription is regulated by epigenetic machinery, particularly the acetylation of cccDNA-bound histone 3 (H3) and H4, the potential contributions of histone methylation and related host factors remain obscure. Here, by screening a series of methyltransferases and demethylases, we identified protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as an effective restrictor of HBV transcription and replication. In cell culture-based models for HBV infection and in liver tissues of patients with chronic HBV infection, we found that symmetric dimethylation of arginine 3 on H4 on cccDNA was a repressive marker of cccDNA transcription and was regulated by PRMT5 depending on its methyltransferase domain. Moreover, PRMT5-triggered symmetric dimethylation of arginine 3 on H4 on the cccDNA minichromosome involved an interaction with the HBV core protein and the Brg1-based human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, which resulted in down-regulation of the binding of RNA polymerase II to cccDNA. In addition to the inhibitory effect on cccDNA transcription, PRMT5 inhibited HBV core particle DNA production independently of its methyltransferase activity. Further study revealed that PRMT5 interfered with pregenomic RNA encapsidation by preventing its interaction with viral polymerase protein through binding to the reverse transcriptase-ribonuclease H region of polymerase, which is crucial for the polymerase-pregenomic RNA interaction. CONCLUSION: PRMT5 restricts HBV replication through a two-part mechanism including epigenetic suppression of cccDNA transcription and interference with pregenomic RNA encapsidation; these findings improve the understanding of epigenetic regulation of HBV transcription and host-HBV interaction, thus providing new insights into targeted therapeutic intervention.

631,17093250,Low-carbohydrate-diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease in women,"BACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate diets have been advocated for weight loss and to prevent obesity, but the long-term safety of these diets has not been determined. METHODS: We evaluated data on 82,802 women in the Nurses' Health Study who had completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Data from the questionnaire were used to calculate a low-carbohydrate-diet score, which was based on the percentage of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein (a higher score reflects a higher intake of fat and protein and a lower intake of carbohydrate). The association between the low-carbohydrate-diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease was examined. RESULTS: During 20 years of follow-up, we documented 1994 new cases of coronary heart disease. After multivariate adjustment, the relative risk of coronary heart disease comparing highest and lowest deciles of the low-carbohydrate-diet score was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.18; P for trend=0.19). The relative risk comparing highest and lowest deciles of a low-carbohydrate-diet score on the basis of the percentage of energy from carbohydrate, animal protein, and animal fat was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.19; P for trend=0.52), whereas the relative risk on the basis of the percentage of energy from intake of carbohydrates, vegetable protein, and vegetable fat was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88; P for trend=0.002). A higher glycemic load was strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (relative risk comparing highest and lowest deciles, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.15; P for trend=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and fat are not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease in women. When vegetable sources of fat and protein are chosen, these diets may moderately reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.",0
632,15493119,[Life-threatening adverse effects of pharmacologic antihyperuricemic therapy],"Minor hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol presenting as skin rash occur in approximately 2% of patients. A more severe, albeit rare, hypersensitivity reaction with fever, eosinophilia, dermatitis, renal failure, vasculitis and hepatic dysfunction carries a mortality of up to 20%. The incidence of this severe reaction can probably be reduced by adjusting the dose of allopurinol in patients with impaired renal function. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are metabolised by xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that is inhibited by allopurinol. Concomitant administration can result in life-threatening neutropenia unless the dose of allopurinol is reduced by approximately 75%. The uricosuric agent benzbromarone has recently been withdrawn from the market because of several cases of fulminant hepatic failure with subsequent death of the patient or liver transplantation.",1

634,9829158,Candesartan cilexetil. A review of its use in essential hypertension,"Candesartan cilexetil is completely converted to the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan selectively blocks and dissociates slowly from the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor which mediates most of the known activities of angiotensin II. When administered once daily, oral candesartan cilexetil 8 to 32 mg dose-dependently and effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In comparative studies, candesartan cilexetil 8 mg/day was as effective as usual therapeutic dosages of enalapril, losartan potassium, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. One study showed candesartan cilexetil 16 mg/day to be more effective than losartan potassium 50 mg/day. Furthermore, the combination of candesartan cilexetil with either hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine resulted in additive antihypertensive effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that the blood pressure-lowering effects of candesartan cilexetil are associated with the prevention or improvement of end-organ damage in patients with hypertension. However, this requires further confirmation in clinical studies. Candesartan cilexetil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with hypertension and does not affect glucose homeostasis or the serum lipid profile in those with coexisting type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Candesartan cilexetil is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Pooled data indicate that the tolerability profile of the drug is not significantly different from that of placebo, with headache being the most commonly reported event. Adverse events are not dose related and are mostly mild to moderate in severity. Candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than enalapril, primarily because of a reduced incidence of cough, and was not associated with the hypokalaemia or hyperuricaemia seen with hydrochlorothiazide in a study in patients aged > or = 75 years. The drug has an adverse events profile similar to that of losartan potassium in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: once daily candesartan cilexetil is effective and well tolerated when used once daily (as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents) in patients with mild, moderate or severe hypertension. Initially, however, the drug is likely to be used as an alternative to other agents in patients not responding to or intolerant of their current drug therapy.",1
635,27847886,"Leishmaniasis revisited: Current aspects on epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment","Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted by phlebotomine female sand flies of the genera Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia in the old and new world, respectively. More than 20 well-recognized Leishmania species are known to infect humans and cause visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous (ML) forms of the disease. Approximately 350 million people are at risk of contracting the disease and an estimated 1.6 million new cases occur annually. The disease mainly affects poor people in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and is associated with malnutrition, population migration, poor residency conditions, frail immune system and lack of resources. Previously, diagnosis of leishmaniasis relied mainly on invasive techniques of detecting parasites in splenic and bone marrow aspirates. Nevertheless, serological tests using the recombinant kinesin antigen (rK39) and molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction) are considered the best options for diagnosis today, despite problems related to varying sensitivities and specificities and field adaptability. Therapy of leishmaniasis ranges from local treatment of cutaneous lesions to systemic often toxic, therapy for disseminated CL, ML and VL. Agents with efficacy against leishmaniasis include amphotericin B, pentavalent antimonial drugs, paromomycin and miltefosine. No single therapy of VL currently offers satisfactory efficacy along with safety. This article provides a brief and updated systematic review on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of this neglected disease.",1
636,16317692,"Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: results of a United States multicenter, prospective study","""Severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity frequently leads to acute liver failure (ALF). We determined the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acetaminophen-induced ALF at 22 tertiary care centers in the United States. Detailed prospective data were gathered on 662 consecutive patients over a 6-year period fulfilling standard criteria for ALF (coagulopathy and encephalopathy), from which 275 (42%) were determined to result from acetaminophen liver injury. The annual percentage of acetaminophen-related ALF rose during the study from 28% in 1998 to 51% in 2003. Median dose ingested was 24 g (equivalent to 48 extra-strength tablets). Unintentional overdoses accounted for 131 (48%) cases, intentional (suicide attempts) 122 (44%), and 22 (8%) were of unknown intent. In the unintentional group, 38% took two or more acetaminophen preparations simultaneously, and 63% used narcotic-containing compounds. Eighty-one percent of unintentional patients reported taking acetaminophen and/or other analgesics for acute or chronic pain syndromes. Overall, 178 subjects (65%) survived, 74 (27%) died without transplantation, and 23 subjects (8%) underwent liver transplantation; 71% were alive at 3 weeks. Transplant-free survival rate and rate of liver transplantation were similar between intentional and unintentional groups. In conclusion, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity far exceeds other causes of acute liver failure in the United States. Susceptible patients have concomitant depression, chronic pain, alcohol or narcotic use, and/or take several preparations simultaneously. Education of patients, physicians, and pharmacies to limit high-risk use settings is recommended.""",1

A cross-sectional study","To describe an adult population with congenital limb deficiency (CLD) recruited through the National Resource Centre for Rare Disorders (TRS) in Norway: (1) demographic factors, (2) clinical features, (3) pain and (4) use of health care and welfare services. Cross-sectional study. In 2012, a postal questionnaire was sent to 186 eligible persons with CLD, age 20 years and older. Ninety-seven respondents, median-age 39 years (range: 20-82); 71% were women. The population was divided into two subgroups: (1) unilateral upper-limb deficiency (UULD) n = 77, (2) multiple and/or lower-limb deficiency (MLD/LLD). About 40% worked full-time, 18% received disability pensions and 64% reported chronic pain, mostly bilateral pain. Grip-improving devices were used more often than prostheses; 23% were previous prosthesis users. Use of health care and welfare services are described. No significant differences were found between the subgroups regarding pain or employment status. Persons with CLD reported increased prevalence of chronic pain, mostly bilateral, and increased prevalence of early retirement. A greater focus on the benefits of the use of assistive devices, the consequences of overuse and vocational guidance may moderate pain and prevent early retirement. Further studies of more representative samples should be conducted to confirm our findings. Most adults with congenital limb deficiency (CLD) live ordinary lives and experience normal life events. However, several report chronic pain and retire before normal retirement age. In spite of free and accessible prosthetic services, a large fraction chooses not to use prosthesis, more use grip-improving devices for specific activities. These preferences should be acknowledged by rehabilitation specialists. Focus on individually adapted environments, more information about the consequences of overuse, and vocational guidance may moderate pain and prevent early retirement. ",0
638,2671740,A comparison of the effects of hydrochlorothiazide and captopril on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension,"It has been suggested that the metabolic side effects of antihypertensive drugs are responsible for their failure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with hypertension. Therefore, in 50 patients with essential hypertension, we performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of captopril (mean [+/- SD] dose, 81 +/- 24 mg per day) and hydrochlorothiazide (40 +/- 12 mg per day) over two four-month treatment periods. Captopril increased the insulin-mediated disposal of glucose, as compared with placebo, from 5.7 +/- 2.4 to 6.3 +/- 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute (P less than 0.05), whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused a decrease from 6.4 +/- 2.0 to 5.7 +/- 1.9 (P less than 0.01). Captopril had no effect on the basal insulin concentration, but it decreased the late (30- to 90-minute) insulin response to glucose and increased the early (2- to 6-minute) insulin peak. Hydrochlorothiazide increased the basal insulin concentration and the late insulin response to glucose. These findings may be explained by an increase in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a decrease with hydrochlorothiazide. Little or no change was seen in serum lipid or lipoprotein levels during treatment with captopril, whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused significant increases in serum total (5 percent) and low-density lipoprotein (6 percent) cholesterol levels and total (15 percent) and very-low-density lipoprotein (25 percent) triglyceride levels, as compared with placebo (P less than 0.01 for all comparisons). We conclude that hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of essential hypertension has adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. It is possible, but not proved in this study, that these changes may contribute to the risk for diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. In contrast, captopril appears to have beneficial or no effects on glucose and lipid metabolism.",0
639,21410372,Nurse staffing and inpatient hospital mortality,"BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies of hospital-level administrative data have shown an association between lower levels of staffing of registered nurses (RNs) and increased patient mortality. However, such studies have been criticized because they have not shown a direct link between the level of staffing and individual patient experiences and have not included sufficient statistical controls. METHODS: We used data from a large tertiary academic medical center involving 197,961 admissions and 176,696 nursing shifts of 8 hours each in 43 hospital units to examine the association between mortality and patient exposure to nursing shifts during which staffing by RNs was 8 hours or more below the staffing target. We also examined the association between mortality and high patient turnover owing to admissions, transfers, and discharges. We used Cox proportional-hazards models in the analyses with adjustment for characteristics of patients and hospital units. RESULTS: Staffing by RNs was within 8 hours of the target level for 84% of shifts, and patient turnover was within 1 SD of the day-shift mean for 93% of shifts. Overall mortality was 61% of the expected rate for similar patients on the basis of modified diagnosis-related groups. There was a significant association between increased mortality and increased exposure to unit shifts during which staffing by RNs was 8 hours or more below the target level (hazard ratio per shift 8 hours or more below target, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.03; P<0.001). The association between increased mortality and high patient turnover was also significant (hazard ratio per high-turnover shift, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.06; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective observational study, staffing of RNs below target levels was associated with increased mortality, which reinforces the need to match staffing with patients' needs for nursing care.

640,582971,Regional blood flow determination in rats by the microsphere method during i.v. infusion of vasodilating agents,"The present experiments were performed to gain information on changes in various organ flow rates during i.v. infusion of vasodilating substances. The microsphere method with the reference sample technique was used in rats to measure simultaneously different organ flow rates. The detection of the spheres (non-radioactive) was performed by macerating the tissues and counting samples under the microscope. As only one microsphere-infection per animal was performed, an untreated experimental group served as a control. The cardiac output was measured in a separate series. The effects of isoproterenol, pentoxifylline, bencyclane, acetylcholine, and dihydroergotoxine (mixture of 3 compounds, Hydergin) consisted of flow increases in several organs while the flow in others remained nearly unchanged. Only during the action of sodium nitroprusside the flow values were found decreased or remained unchanged. This substance led to decreased cardiac output, whereas that in the other groups was unchanged or raised. The experiments point to quantitatively different reactions on cardiac output distribution during application of the vasodilating substances tested. ",0
641,25589154,Surgery under general anaesthesia in severe hidradenitis suppurativa: a study of 363 primary operations in 113 patients,"Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a difficult undertaking, especially as there is no consensus on what surgical technique is preferred. At our centre severe HS (Hurley II/III) is operated under general anaesthesia, mostly with the STEEP procedure. To investigate characteristics, surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction of HS patients who underwent deroofing or STEEP under general anaesthesia. A clinical records-based retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients who had surgery under general anaesthesia between 1999 and 2013. Patient satisfaction was retrospectively investigated with questionnaires. A total of 482 operations (363 primary operations and 119 re-operations) were performed during the study period. The proportion of women in the included population was 68%. The median diagnostic delay (patient's and doctor's delay) was 6.5 years. Relapses occurred after 29.2% of primary operations. Women had higher relapse rates than men [odds ratio 2.85 (1.07;7.61)]. Hypergranulation of the wound was the most common complication and occurred in 7% of all operations. The median score patients attributed to the medical effect of surgery was eight of 10 (zero corresponding to very dissatisfied and 10 to very satisfied). The diagnostic delay in HS is long due to a lack of knowledge in both patients and health care professionals, indicating that there is a need for education. Deroofing and the STEEP are effective surgical procedures in severe cases of HS and lead to a relatively high patient satisfaction. The postoperative relapse risk is higher in women. Prospective studies are required for the development of clear guidelines on the appropriate choice of surgery. ",0
642,2648143,Graft-versus-host disease as adoptive immunotherapy in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms,"The occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia is thought to decrease the probability of recurrence. To study this effect (called adoptive immunotherapy) we modified the prophylaxis of GVHD in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms (mostly leukemia) who received bone marrow transplants. Patients under 30 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three regimens of post-transplantation immunosuppression: Group I (n = 44) received a standard course of methotrexate for 102 days after transplantation, Group II (n = 40) received an abbreviated (11-day) course of methotrexate, and Group III (n = 25) received the standard course of methotrexate plus viable buffy-coat cells from the marrow donors. All 109 patients received cyclophosphamide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight on each of two days), total-body irradiation (2.25 Gy daily for seven days), and unmodified marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors. The frequency of GVHD of Grades II through IV was 25 percent in Group I, 59 percent in Group II, and 82 percent in Group III (P = 0.0001). The incidence of chronic GVHD, however, did not differ significantly among the groups (33, 51, and 44 percent, respectively), nor did the five-year probability of recurrence of disease (38, 45, and 33 percent, respectively). However, mortality from causes other than cancer was 34 percent in Group I, 45 percent in Group II, and 64 percent in Group III (I vs. III, P = 0.024); the deaths were due primarily to infections complicating the course of GVHD. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 3.9 to 7.4), disease-free survival was 41 percent in Group I, 30 percent in Group II, and 24 percent in Group III (the differences were not statistically significant). We conclude that abbreviating methotrexate prophylaxis or infusing donor buffy-coat cells increased the incidence of acute GVHD and related mortality without altering the incidence of chronic GVHD or the recurrence of malignant disease.",0

Nivolumab-associated adverse events include organ-specific autoimmune disorders; autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo and insulin-dependent diabetes. However, predisposed persons are currently unknown. Here, we report serological aggravation of autoimmune thyroid disease in two cases receiving nivolumab: one with Hashimoto disease and another with probable subclinical Hashimoto disease. We should verify if nivolumab-related hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are predisposed to occur in euthyroid individuals with subclinical autoimmune thyroid disease.""",1
644,1531395,Successful induction of long-term specific tolerance to fully allogeneic renal allografts in miniature swine,"Major histocompatibility complex class II matching is of overwhelming importance for achieving tolerance to kidney transplants (KTX) in miniature swine. When class II antigens are matched, long-term specific tolerance across complete MHC class I antigen barriers can uniformly be induced by a 12-day perioperative course of cyclosporine. This same regimen is ineffective in fully MHC-mismatched combinations. We hypothesized that initial induction of tolerance to kidney donor class II antigens by bone marrow transplantation might allow tolerance to be induced to a subsequent fully allogeneic KTX in combination with CsA therapy. We report here the results of such fully allogeneic KTX performed in 4 recipients of prior single-haplotype class II-mismatched BMT. All animals received KTX from donors class II matched to the BMT donor and received a 12-day course of intravenous CsA (10 mg/kg/day). All four animals have maintained normal serum creatinine values (less than 2.0 mg/dl) for greater than 200 days posttransplant. Specific hyporesponsiveness to both BMT and KTX donor-type MHC antigens was found in mixed lymphocyte culture and cell-mediated lympholysis assays. Compared with third-party grafts, significantly prolonged survival of BMT donor-specific (P = 0.031) and KTX donor-specific (P = 0.031) skin grafts was observed. These results demonstrate that induction of tolerance to class II antigens by BMT allows a short course of CsA to induce specific tolerance to fully allogeneic renal allografts. ",0

646,8018138,A comparison of active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation with standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrests occurring in the hospital,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated improved cardiopulmonary circulation during cardiac arrest with the use of a hand-held suction device (Ambu CardioPump) to perform active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The purpose of this study was to compare active compression-decompression with standard CPR during cardiac arrests in hospitalized patients. METHODS: All patients over the age of 18 years who had a witnessed cardiac arrest while hospitalized at our center were enrolled in this trial; they were randomly assigned according to their medical-record numbers to receive either active compression-decompression or standard CPR. The study end points were the rates of initial resuscitation, survival at 24 hours, hospital discharge, and neurologic outcome. Compressions were performed according to the recommendations of the American Heart Association (80 to 100 compressions per minute; depth of compression, 3.8 to 5.1 cm [1.5 to 2 in.]; and 50 percent of the cycle spent in compression). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (45 men and 17 women) with a mean age (+/- SE) of 68 +/- 2 years were entered into the trial. Sixty-two percent of the patients who underwent active compression-decompression were initially resuscitated, as compared with 30 percent of the patients who received standard CPR (P < 0.03); 45 percent of the patients who underwent active compression-decompression survived for at least 24 hours, as compared with 9 percent of patients who underwent standard CPR (P < 0.004). Two of the 62 study patients survived to hospital discharge; both were randomly assigned to receive active compression-decompression. Neurologic outcome, as measured by the Glasgow coma score, was better with active compression-decompression (8.0 +/- 1.3) than with standard CPR (3.5 +/- 0.3; P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we found that, as compared with standard CPR, active compression-decompression CPR improved the rate of initial resuscitation, survival at 24 hours, and neurologic outcome after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Larger trials will be required to assess the potential benefit in terms of long-term survival.",0
647,29778630,BCG vaccination protects against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis ascertained by tuberculin skin testing,"There is conflicting evidence as to whether Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination offers protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ascertained by a positive tuberculin skin test (TST). We investigated the association between BCG vaccination status and TST results in a set of surveys at increasing TST cut-off values to take cross-reactions to BCG vaccination into account. Secondary analysis of data from three consecutive tuberculin surveys done among schoolchildren in Tanzania between 1990 and 2002. BCG vaccination status was ascertained by the presence of a typical scar. We analyzed data of 277,588 children of whom 77.7% were BCG vaccinated and 8.5% had TST indurations ≥ 15 mm, 5.1% ≥ 17 mm and 2.8% ≥ 19 mm. In the combined analysis, odds ratios for a positive TST were > 1 for children with BCG up to TST cut-off values of 16 mm. For cut-off values > 17 mm crude and adjusted odds ratios were significantly < 1, and decreased with further increasing cut-off values. Using a methodology that makes use of the differences in TST reaction sizes between specific and non-specific responses, we showed that BCG vaccination was associated with reduced prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection as measured by the tuberculin skin test, suggesting a protective effect.

648,6804866,Cost effectiveness of lead screening,"Lead-screening programs may reduce childhood disabilities, but at what cost? Through a review of the literature, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis in which the costs, savings, and health benefits of two lead-screening strategies--employing either a free erythrocyte protoporphyrin assay or blood lead measurement--were compared with each other and with a strategy of no screening in a population of three-year-old children. When the prevalence of lead poisoning among the children screened is 7 per cent or more, we estimate that free erythrocyte protoporphyrin screening averts morbidity and results in net savings: It is both better and cheaper than no screening. At prevalences below 7 per cent, the net positive costs from screening and early treatment must be weighed against the noneconomic benefits of improved quality of life and considered in relation to other investments that could be made to benefit society. At all prevalence rates, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin screening is more cost effective than blood lead screening.",0
649,25913287,Long term HER2+ metastatic breast cancer survivors treated by trastuzumab: Results from the French cohort study LHORA,"""PURPOSE: The LORHA study described the clinical features of patients and tumours in long-term responders from a subset of breast cancer patients who responded to 1st-line trastuzumab and without disease progression. METHODS: This was an ambispective, multicentre, non-interventional study conducted in 57 centres in France. Eligible patients were women with HER2+metastatic or locally-advanced breast cancer, treated with 1st-line therapy, progression-free for ?3 years after starting trastuzumab, and followed-up for 12 months. RESULTS: 160 patients were recruited, 128 were included in the efficacy analysis subset (median age: 61 years; [34-95 years]). A majority (88%) had invasive ductal carcinoma; 53% had SBR grade III carcinoma, and 58% were positive for hormonal receptors. The median time since diagnosis was 8 years [3-26 years]. The most frequent metastatic sites were the bone, liver, lymph nodes, and lungs in 43%, 35%, 20% and 19% of patients, respectively. The median duration of 1st-line trastuzumab was 4.5 years [0.8-12.1], combined with paclitaxel and docetaxel in 35 and 72 patients, respectively. Median PFS (progression-free survival) was 6.4 years [5.7; Not Reached]. No trastuzumab-related deaths were observed. In the safety analysis subset (N = 134), 3 cardiac adverse events considered related to trastuzumab were recorded in 3 patients (2.2%), and only one prospective congestive cardiac failure was of grade ?3. CONCLUSIONS: The LORHA study showed that long term responders to 1st-line trastuzumab for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer could achieve a median PFS of more than 6 years, with an acceptable safety profile.""",1
650,25677072,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment for patients in early stages of liver disease,"New treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be highly effective but are associated with substantial costs that may compel clinicians and patients to consider delaying treatment. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of these treatments with a focus on patients in early stages of liver disease. We developed a state-transition (or Markov) model to calculate costs incurred and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained following HCV treatment, and we computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per QALY gained, in 2012 US dollars) for treatment at different stages of liver disease versus delaying treatment until the subsequent liver disease stage. Our analysis did not include the potential treatment benefits associated with reduced non-liver-related mortality or preventing HCV transmission. All parameter values, particularly treatment cost, were varied in sensitivity analyses. The base case scenario represented a 55-year-old patient with genotype 1 HCV infection with a treatment cost of $100,000 and treatment effectiveness of 90%. In this scenario, for a 55-year-old patient with moderate liver fibrosis (Metavir stage F2), the cost-effectiveness of immediately initiating treatment at F2 (versus delaying treatment until F3) was $37,300/QALY. For patients immediately treated at F0 (versus delaying treatment until F1), the threshold of treatment costs that yielded $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY cost-effectiveness ratios were $22,200 and $42,400, respectively. CONCLUSION: Immediate treatment of HCV-infected patients with moderate and advanced fibrosis appears to be cost-effective, and immediate treatment of patients with minimal or no fibrosis can be cost-effective as well, particularly when lower treatment costs are assumed.",0
651,10218775,Hippocampal synaptic plasticity in streptozotocin-diabetic rats: impairment of long-term potentiation and facilitation of long-term depression,"Streptozotocin-diabetic rats, an animal model for diabetes mellitus, show learning deficits and impaired long-term potentiation in the CA1-field of the hippocampus. The present study aimed to further characterize the effects of streptozotocin-diabetes on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in the CA1-field, to extend these findings to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent and independent long-term potentiation in other regions of the hippocampus and to examine effects on long-term depression. First, the effect of diabetes duration on long-term potentiation in the CA1-field was determined. A progressive deficit was observed after a diabetes duration of six to eight weeks, which reached a maximum after 12 weeks of diabetes and remained stable thereafter. Next, long-term potentiation was examined in the dentate gyrus and in the CA3-field after 12 weeks of diabetes. Both were found to be impaired compared to controls. Finally, long-term depression was examined in the CA1-field of the hippocampus after 12 weeks of diabetes and found to be enhanced in slices from diabetic rats compared to controls. Changes in synaptic plasticity were observed in hippocampal slices from streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation was impaired in the CA1-field and dentate gyrus and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-independent long-term potentiation was impaired in the CA3-field. In contrast, expression of long-term depression was facilitated in CA1. It is suggested that this combination of changes in plasticity may reflect alterations in intracellular signalling pathways.

652,16179409,Effects of a fixed meal pattern on ghrelin secretion: evidence for a learned response independent of nutrient status,"Circulating levels of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin increase during fasting and decrease with refeeding. Exogenous ghrelin administration is a potent stimulus for food intake in rodents and humans. In subjects on fixed feeding schedules, ghrelin increases before each meal, raising the possibility that anticipation of meals, in addition to effects of fasting and feeding, contributes to ghrelin secretion. To distinguish among these regulatory influences, plasma ghrelin profiles were generated in freely fed rats and in meal-fed rats trained to consume their daily calories over a 4-h period in the light phase. In freely feeding rats, plasma ghrelin levels increased to a peak of 778 +/- 95 pg/ml just before the onset of the dark. Similarly, in meal-fed rats anticipating a large meal of either chow or Ensure at their usual feeding time, plasma ghrelin increased steadily over the 2 h preceding the meal to peaks of 2192 +/- 218 and 2075 +/- 92 pg/ml, respectively. When freely fed rats were food deprived for a time equivalent to meal-fed rats, there was no peak of plasma ghrelin. In addition, eating-induced suppression of the ghrelin response differed significantly between meal-fed rats and ad libitum-fed rats receiving meals of similar size. These findings indicate that anticipation of eating, as well as fasting/feeding status, influences pre- and postprandial plasma ghrelin levels in rats. Together, these data are consistent with a role for ghrelin in the regulation of anticipatory processes involved in food intake and nutrient disposition. ",0
653,20220177,Whole-genome sequencing in a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy,"BACKGROUND: Whole-genome sequencing may revolutionize medical diagnostics through rapid identification of alleles that cause disease. However, even in cases with simple patterns of inheritance and unambiguous diagnoses, the relationship between disease phenotypes and their corresponding genetic changes can be complicated. Comprehensive diagnostic assays must therefore identify all possible DNA changes in each haplotype and determine which are responsible for the underlying disorder. The high number of rare, heterogeneous mutations present in all humans and the paucity of known functional variants in more than 90% of annotated genes make this challenge particularly difficult. Thus, the identification of the molecular basis of a genetic disease by means of whole-genome sequencing has remained elusive. We therefore aimed to assess the usefulness of human whole-genome sequencing for genetic diagnosis in a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. METHODS: We identified a family with a recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease for which the genetic basis had not been identified. We sequenced the whole genome of the proband, identified all potential functional variants in genes likely to be related to the disease, and genotyped these variants in the affected family members. RESULTS: We identified and validated compound, heterozygous, causative alleles in SH3TC2 (the SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 2 gene), involving two mutations, in the proband and in family members affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Separate subclinical phenotypes segregated independently with each of the two mutations; heterozygous mutations confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including the carpal tunnel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: As shown in this study of a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, whole-genome sequencing can identify clinically relevant variants and provide diagnostic information to inform the care of patients.",0
654,3510146,Azathioprine and hepatic venocclusive disease in renal transplant patients,"We report 3 cases of hepatic venocclusive disease occurring in renal transplant patients receiving azathioprine and combine our experience with 4 other previously reported cases. The data suggest a clinical syndrome characterized by (a) delayed clinical onset, (b) striking male predominance, (c) presentation with jaundice followed by evidence of portal hypertension, and (d) poor prognosis. One of our patients, who is still alive 40 mo after the first onset of symptoms of liver disease, showed striking clinical improvement with discontinuation of azathioprine and subsequent deterioration on reinstitution. We suggest that azathioprine may be closely linked with the development of venocclusive disease in renal transplant patients and that the frequency of this disorder may be more common than previously reported. To attempt to prevent a fatal outcome, this group of patients should be closely monitored for the earliest signs of hepatic venocclusive disease through periodic serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase determinations. Patients with abnormal tests should undergo liver biopsy. If hepatic venocclusive disease is found, prompt withdrawal of azathioprine is indicated.",1
655,24992761,Role and mechanism of radiological protection cream in treating radiation dermatitis in rats,"To explore the role and mechanism of a radiation protection cream (Rp) in the treatment of radiation dermatitis, and to accumulate necessary technical information for a new drug report on Rp. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to establish the method of measuring the main effective ingredients of sovereign and adjuvant herbs of Rp drugs, and to formulate the draft quality standards of Rp. A total of 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into the Model, Trolamine cream (Tc), Rp and Blank groups according to a random number table method. The skin of each rat's buttocks was irradiated using an electron linear accelerator to establish an acute radiation dermatitis model. The histological changes were observed under light microscopy and electron microscopy during wound healing and the effect of Rp on rat fibroblast Ku70/80 gene expression was detected at the transcriptional level. Pathological examination revealed that Rp protected the cellular and subcellular structures of skin after irradiation, promoting the proliferation and restoration of collagen fibers. Ku70/80 mRNA expression levels in the Rp and Tc groups were higher than that in the model group (P < 0.05). Moreover, The majority of grade radiation dermatitis relative to the Model, Rp and Tc groups for reducing grade III and IV dermatitis efficiency were 85.7% and 69.2% (P < 0.05), respectively. The efficacy of Rp group in treating radiation dermatitis was better than the Trolamine cream group by 16.5% (P < 0.05). Compared with Tc, Rp had certain advantages in the efficacy and performance to price ratio. Thus, Rp is considered an effective alternative formulation for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis. ",0
656,10594489,A cohort study on the risk of acute liver injury among users of ketoconazole and other antifungal drugs,"AIMS: The aim of this cohort study was to estimate the risk of clinical acute liver injury among users of oral antifungals identified in the general population of the General Practice Research Database in UK. METHODS: The cohort included 69 830 patients, 20-79 years old, free of liver and systemic disease, who had received at least one prescription for either oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or terbinafine between 1991 and 1996. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of acute liver injury were identified and validated. Ten cases occurred during nonuse of oral antifungals with a background rate of 0.6 per 100,000 person-months (95% confidence interval 0.3,1.1). Five cases occurred during current use of oral antifungals. Two were using ketoconazole, another two itraconazole, and one terbinafine. Incidence rates of acute liver injury were 134.1 per 100 000 person-months (36.8,488.0) for ketoconazole, 10.4 (2.9-38.1) for itraconazole, and 2.5 (0.4,13. 9) for terbinafine. The remaining case was associated with past use of fluconazole. Ketoconazole was the antifungal associated with the highest relative risk, 228.0 (95% confidence interval 33.9,933.0), when compared with the risk among nonusers, followed by itraconazole and terbinafine with relative risks of 17.7 (2.6,72.6) and 4.2 (0.2, 24.9), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ketoconazole and itraconazole were the two oral antifungal associated with a marked increase of clinical acute liver injury. The risk associated with ketoconazole should be taken into account when prescribing it as initial treatment for uncomplicated fungal infections.",1
657,11155780,Ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis with anti-nuclear antibody in serum,"We describe a case of severe cholestatic hepatitis following administration of ticlopidine. A 57-year-old man without known liver disease developed jaundice approximately 3 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine for secondary prevention of stroke. Hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal liver function test values resolved 5 months after withdrawal of ticlopidine. The diagnosis of ticlopidine-induced cholestasis was made after thorough investigations had excluded other causes of jaundice. He was not retreated with ticlopidine. This case may serve to illustrate the possibility of ticlopidine hepatotoxicity, which has rarely been reported. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis accompanied by autoantibody has not been previously reported. This case suggests that regular assessment of liver function should be performed in the initial 3 months of ticlopidine treatment due to the potential risk of adverse effects. In patients with abnormal biochemical test results, autoantibodies should be assessed.",1
658,20301206,Hepatitis B virus replication in primary macaque hepatocytes: crossing the species barrier toward a new small primate model,"The development of new anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapies, especially immunotherapeutic approaches, has been limited by the lack of a primate model more accessible than chimpanzees. We have previously demonstrated that sylvanus and cynomolgus macaques are susceptible to in vivo HBV infection after intrahepatic HBV DNA inoculation. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of primary macaque hepatocytes (PMHs) to HBV infection with a highly efficient HBV genome-mediated transfer system via a recombinant baculovirus (Bac-HBV). Freshly prepared PMHs, isolated from macaque liver tissue by collagenase perfusion, were transduced with Bac-HBV, and intermediates of replication were followed for 9 days post-transduction. Evidence of HBV replication (hepatitis B surface antigen secretion, viral DNA, RNA, and covalently closed circular DNA) was detected from day 1 to day 9 post-transduction. HBV markers were dose-dependent and still detectable at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Importantly, transduced PMHs secreted all typical forms of HBV particles, as evidenced by a cesium chloride gradient as well as transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand was used to stimulate freshly prepared macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells to generate TLR9-induced cytokines. We then demonstrated the antiviral effects of both TLR9-induced cytokines and nucleoside analogue (lamivudine) on HBV replication in transduced PMHs. CONCLUSION: Baculovirus-mediated genome transfer initiated a full HBV replication cycle in PMHs; thus highlighted both the baculovirus efficiency in crossing the species barrier and macaque susceptibility to HBV infection. Moreover, our results demonstrate the relevance of thus system for antiviral compound evaluations with either nucleoside analogues or inhibitory cytokines. Cynomolgus macaques are readily available, are immunologically closely related to humans, and may therefore represent a promising model for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies.",0
659,25588965,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, and TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3) and markers for vascularization in functioning and non-functioning bleb capsules of glaucoma drainage implants","To investigate and compare functioning versus non-functioning glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) capsules for selective markers of extracellular matrix degradation and vascularity. In three samples of both functioning and non-functioning blebs, immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3 and CD31. A non-functioning bleb was defined as IOP >21 mmHg or <20% reduction in IOP from baseline with maximal tolerated medication. The samples were classified into five grades based on immunostaining: no staining, no significant staining, mild, moderate or marked staining. Expression of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3 was mostly low in both functioning and non-functioning blebs. However, immunostaining of MMP-9 was marked in samples taken from functioning GDIs and correlated with the presence of vascular profiles in the luminal bleb. CD31 immunoreactivity was more intense in the outer layers of the bleb than in the inner layers. In non-functioning blebs, immunoreactivity for TIMP-3 was significant through the whole bleb wall, but only mild in the inner zone of functioning blebs. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were barely detectable. Staining of TIMP-3 was seen to be lower in the vicinity of the small blood vessels. In avascular bleb wall, increased expression of TIMP-3 suggests its potential role in the inhibition of angiogenesis as reported previously in vivo. The abundance of MMP-9 in bleb capsule wall of relatively old patients might lead to weakened bleb capsule wall architecture and increasing filtration of aqueous humour through the capsule, which are reflected in a lower IOP.

660,12173489,Safety and efficacy of ET-743: the French experience,"""Initial evidence of clinical benefit with ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743) in patients with sarcoma was provided during a Phase I pharmacokinetic study in which 52 patients received ET-743 at doses of 50-1800 micrograms/m2 as a 24 h continuous infusion every 3 weeks. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities; liver toxicity (a severe but transient and reversible increase in transaminase concentrations) was not treatment limiting. In conjunction with results obtained with ET-743 in a compassionate-use program, these indications of activity in heavily pretreated patients with sarcoma prompted initiation of a French multicenter Phase II study of ET-743 in this population. From February 1999 to January 2001, 54 patients with advanced anthracycline-pretreated soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) received ET-743 at a dose of 1500 micrograms/m2 every 3 weeks by continuous 24 h infusion. The main histological subtype was leiomyosarcoma (37%); the majority of primary tumors were visceral (24%) or uterine (19%) sarcomas. In this Phase II population (> or = 25% negative prognostic or predictive factors of response to chemotherapy; > or = 50% anthracycline- and ifosfamide-resistant), safety data were comparable to those obtained in the Phase I and compassionate-use studies. Asymptomatic and reversible neutropenia and transaminitis (grade 3/4) were the most frequent toxicities (approximately 60% of patients); febrile neutropenia was infrequent (< 10%). No mucositis, alopecia, cardiac or neurotoxicity was observed. Two severe cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred. Side effects were non-cumulative, reversible and manageable. Of 52 evaluable patients, three (6%) achieved a long-lasting (8-13 months) partial response, four (8%) achieved a minor response (25-50% tumor reduction) and 22 (42%) achieved disease stabilization. With a 13-month median follow-up, median survival was almost 11 months. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 26.5% and the overall survival rate at 12 months was almost 50%. The response rate was uninfluenced by tumor metastatic site, size or anthracycline sensitivity status. These results, combined with the lack of cumulative toxicity, confirm the role of ET-743 in the treatment of advanced STS.""",1
661,23834069,Eye tracking communication devices in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: impact on disability and quality of life,"People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PwALS) show progressive loss of voluntary muscle strength. In advanced disease, motor and phonatory impairments seriously hinder the patient's interpersonal communication. High-tech devices such as eye tracking communication devices (ETCDs) are used to aid communication in the later stages of ALS. We sought to evaluate the effect of ETCDs on patient disability, quality of life (QoL), and user satisfaction, in a group of 35 regular ETCD users in late-stage ALS with tetraplegia and anarthria. The following scales were administered: 1) the Individually Prioritized Problem Assessment (IPPA) scale, in three conditions: without device, with ETCD and, when applicable, with an Eye Transfer (ETRAN) board; 2) the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS); and 3) the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0). With ETRAN, IPPA showed an increase in communicative abilities with respect to the condition without device, but ETCD produced a further significant increase. PIADS evidenced a large increase of QoL, and QUEST 2.0 showed high user satisfaction with ETCD use. In conclusion, ETCDs should be considered in late-stage ALS with tetraplegia and anarthria, since in these patients they can reduce communication disability and improve QoL. ",0
662,23643122,Refined liquid smoke: a potential antilisterial additive to cold-smoked sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka),"Cold-smoked salmon (CSS) is a potentially hazardous ready-to-eat food product due to the high risk of contamination with Listeria monocytogenes and lack of a listericidal step. We investigated the antilisterial property of liquid smokes (LS) against Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 (surrogate to L. monocytogenes) as a potential supplement to vacuum-packaged CSS. A full-strength LS (Code 10-Poly), and three commercially refined fractions (AM-3, AM-10, and 1291) having less color and flavor (lower content of phenols and carbonyl-containing compounds) were tested. In vitro assays showed strong inhibition for all LS except for 1291. The CSS strips were surface coated with AM-3 and AM-10 at 1% LS (vol/wt) with an L-shaped glass rod and then inoculated with L. innocua at 3.5 log CFU/g, vacuum packaged, and stored at 4°C. The LS did not completely eliminate L. innocua but provided a 2-log reduction by day 14, with no growth up to 35 days of refrigerated storage. A simple difference sensory test by 180 untrained panelists showed the application of AM-3 did not significantly influence the overall sensorial quality of CSS. In essence, the application of the refined LS as an antilisterial additive to CSS is recommended. ",0
663,3004711,Characterization of acquired epipodophyllotoxin resistance in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line: loss of drug-stimulated DNA cleavage activity,"Recent evidence indicates that type II DNA topoisomerases mediate epipodophyllotoxin-induced DNA damage and may be intrinsic to the drug's antitumor effects. Using an epipodophyllotoxin-resistant cell line, we have now further defined the relationship between DNA damage and cell death and delineated the significance of certain drug-enzyme interactions. When compared to wild-type cells, the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, VpmR-5, exhibits marked resistance to both the cytotoxic and DNA cleavage activities of etoposide (VP-16). Steady-state concentrations of radiolabeled VP-16 are identical in both cell lines. Catalytic activity in crude nuclear extracts from wild-type and VpmR-5 cells is equal and is equally sensitive to inhibition by VP-16. However, using an assay that specifically measures generation of 5' protein-linked breaks in 32P-labeled 3' DNA, we have found that DNA cleavage activity in nuclear extract from the VpmR-5 line is profoundly resistant to stimulation by VP-16. Further, a somatic cell hybrid line of VpmR-5 cells and drug-sensitive EOT-3 cells exhibits recovery of VP-16 sensitivity in concert with reconstitution of DNA cleavage activity. These data indicate that stimulation of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage, rather than loss of normal topoisomerase function, is responsible for epipodophyllotoxin-induced cytotoxicity. ",0

We report a case of NMO spectrum disorder that developed acute cervical segmental denervation during an episode of transverse myelitis. Case report and a literature review. A 69-year-old woman presented with right leg weakness, which improved in 2 weeks of intravenous methylprednisolone. Six weeks later, she returned with recurrent transverse myelitis followed by left hand weakness and atrophy. Electromyography showed active denervation on left C8/T1-innervated muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging of thoracic spine showed patchy T2-signal enhancement from T10 to lower cervical spine. NMO antibody was positive. Review of literature revealed 5 cases of cervical transverse myelitis that developed denervation on electromyography. Segmental denervation may occur in NMO and variants resulting from severe myelitis extending to involve gray and white matter leads to anterior horn cell loss. ",0

Heart failure is more common and just as lethal as ischemic heart disease in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). The incidence of nonfatal heart disease in dialysis and transplant populations has now been described in detail. Although standard risk factors for heart disease that are more common among patients with CKD than in the general population do not adequately explain the greatly increased risk of heart disease in patients with severe CKD, neither do as yet identified """"nontraditional"""" risk factors. However, in addition to the factors not common in the general population, such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markers of systemic inflammation, patients with CKD in the modern era may also exhibit excessive thrombotic tendencies. Screening for heart disease in this population relies mainly on dobutamine stress echocardiography or nuclear scintigraphy. The role of electron beam CT (EBCT) scanning is currently controversial. The indications for coronary angiography are the same for patients with CKD as for the general population, but patients with CKD are at greatly increased risk for contrast-associated nephropathy, the least controversial preventive therapy, which consists of isotonic saline and N-acetylcysteine. Finally, patients with CKD do not currently receive adequate medical therapy for prevention and treatment of heart disease. """,0

668,2593049,Animal model of margosa oil ingestion with Reye-like syndrome. Pathogenesis of microvesicular fatty liver,"The aetiology and pathogenesis of Reye's syndrome (RS) are incompletely understood. A number of environmental toxins and biological agents, including viruses, have been postulated to cause RS, either acting alone or synergistically. Most investigations have suggested that the primary insult is in the liver mitochondria, leading to a complex biochemical catastrophe, with death from encephalopathy. Margosa oil (MO), a long-chain fatty acid compound, has been shown to cause a Reye-like syndrome with death from hepatoencephalopathy, in children in Malaysia and India. The present time-course study performed in MO-administered mice showed the development of hepatic lesions with many features of RS. MO acts rapidly, within 30 min, on the nuclei of hepatocytes inducing mitoses and binucleated cells. This is followed by mitochondrial injury, with swelling, rarefaction of matrix, loss of dense bodies, pleomorphism, and loss of ribosomes starting at 60 min. There is loss of liver glycogen, and proliferation and hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by the presence of lipid droplets in the hyaloplasm, and globules within dilated cisterns of the ER. Additional fatty acids from lipolysis of body adipocytes, and fat globules from intestinal MO ingestion further aggravate the liver fatty change. There is evidence of fat globule ingestion by endocytosis into hepatocytes at the level of the sinusoids. The development of microvesicular liver steatosis and glycogen depletion due to involvement of liver cell organelles occur rapidly as in RS.",1
669,31407640,"Association between hours worked in paid employment and diet quality, frequency of eating out and consuming takeaways in the UK","To examine associations between hours worked and diet quality, frequency of eating out and consuming takeaways. Data were taken from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008-2014). Associations between hours worked in paid employment and diet quality, assessed using the Diet Quality Index (DQI) and selected foods and nutrients, were tested using linear regression models. Associations between hours worked and frequency of eating out and consuming takeaways were tested using ordinal logistic regression models. All models were adjusted for sex, age, equivalised household income, household composition and household food role. UK. Adults (n 2154) aged 19-64 years in employment. Mean (95 % CI) hours worked per week was 36·1 (35·6, 36·6) and mean DQI score was 41·9 (41·2, 42·5) %. Hours worked was not associated with DQI score, frequency of eating out or consuming takeaways. Hours worked was positively associated with consuming red meat, processed meat and alcohol intake. Adults working more hours had lower intake of fibre but higher total fat and saturated fat intakes if they lived in households with children. Working hours may not be the main factor driving poor-quality diets among this sample of UK adults in employment. Focusing on consumption of foods prepared outside the household may not be the most efficient way to improve diet quality as effort is needed at all levels. Although it is unclear what is driving the differences in nutrient intakes according to household composition, they are important to consider when developing interventions to improve healthy eating.

670,10366681,Effects of cyanide and hypoxia on membrane currents in neurones acutely dissociated from the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat,"Previous reports suggested that some neurones located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) can act as fast oxygen sensors which enhance the sympathetic activity and blood pressure independent of peripheral chemoreceptors. The aim of this study was to compare hypoxic responses of different subpopulations of RVL neurones to ascertain whether the hypoxic sensitivity is restricted to one group of these neurones. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from acutely dissociated neurones obtained from RVL of P13-P19 rats. Short-lasting hypoxia (1-2 min) was evoked by pressure injection of NaCN or lowering pO2. Cells projecting to the upper thoracic segments were retrogradely labelled with fluorescent beads. Catecholaminergic (CA) or non-catecholaminergic (non-CA) neurones were identified using single-cell reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunocytochemistry. Recordings were made from 38 neurones (26 spinally-projecting, 12 non-spinal) using Cs+/TEA or K+-containing pipettes. In most of the cells tested with slow depolarising ramp commands (78%; including spinally-projecting and non-spinal neurones, as well as CA and non-CA neurones), NaCN or hypoxia evoked a reversible increase of the sustained inward current. Extracellular application of 1 mM Co2+ or 25 nM TTX revealed three components of the hypoxia-sensitive inward current which resembled the persistent sodium (INaP), low threshold calcium (LVA Ca2+) and high threshold calcium (HVA Ca2+) currents. The NaCN or hypoxia induced increase of the current could also be observed during step commands. Recordings with K+-containing pipettes during similar depolarising ramps revealed, in addition, a reversible increase of IK in 78% of tested cells (in all four types of examined neurones). These results are consistent with the concepts that RVL neurones can act as a central oxygen sensor. However, in contrast to the previously published data demonstrating that in pentobarbital anaesthetised rats only the barosensitive and spinally projecting cells were affected by a short-lasting hypoxia, our findings obtained with dissociated RVL neurones indicate that sensitivity to hypoxia is widely distributed within this part of the medulla oblongata.

671,23656835,Burden of self-reported acute gastrointestinal illness in China: a population-based survey,"Acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) is an important public-health problem worldwide. Previous national studies of the incidence of AGI in China were performed decades ago, and detailed information was not available. This study therefore sought to determine the magnitude, distribution, and burden of self-reported AGI in China. Twelve-month, retrospective face-to-face surveys were conducted in 20 sentinel sites from six provinces between July 2010 and July 2011. In total, 39686 interviews were completed. The overall adjusted monthly prevalence of AGI was 4.2% (95% confidence interval, 4.0-4.4), corresponding to 0.56 episodes of AGI per person-year. Rates of AGI were highest in children aged < 5 years. Healthcare was sought by 56.1% of those reporting illness. Of the cases who visited a doctor, 32.7% submitted a stool sample. The use of antibiotics was reported by 49.7% of the cases who sought medical care and 54.0% took antidiarrhoeals. In the multivariable model, gender, age, education, household type, residence, season, province and travel were significant risk factors of being a case of AGI. This first population-based study in China indicated that AGI represents a substantial burden of health. Further research into the specific pathogens is needed to better estimate the burden of AGI and foodborne disease in China. ",0
672,15059030,Population genomics of drug response,"Genetic diversity contributes to both disease susceptibility and variability in response to drugs. However, it has proven difficult to isolate genes that underlie common complex disease, and genetic variations that influence clinical responses to drugs remain largely uncovered. The candidate gene approach to uncover genetic variations that contribute to disease susceptibility or variations in response to common drugs has not met expectations. Although the sib-pair linkage approach has certain theoretical advantages in dealing with common/complex disease, success has been slow in coming. Meanwhile family studies including siblings, cousins and second cousins, and studies in well-defined founder populations, have increasingly gained popularity and enabled scientists to map and isolate genes for common complex disease, such as schizophrenia and asthma. The latter method has generated new hope that this approach may also be effective in mapping genes that regulate drug response. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that corticosteroid sensitivity is a mapable trait in patients with asthma. Collectively, these studies support the value of leveraging information available within population-based data systems to map and isolate genes for common complex disease and drug response. ",0
673,24336425,Use of formal advance care planning documents: a national survey of UK Paediatric Intensive Care Units,"Advance Care Planning (ACP) is nationally a core element of adult and paediatric palliative care strategies. It is defined as a process of discussion between an individual, their care providers and those close to them, about future care. Formal procedures and processes can help with some of the most difficult elements of communication related to ACP. The majority of children who die do so in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). This survey aimed to identify and compare paediatric ACP documents that are in use within UK hospitals with a PICU. Email survey of lead clinicians from UK PICUs (n=28). 24 (86%) questionnaires were returned. 14 (58%) responded that formal ACP documents were currently in use within their hospital trust. Of the remainder, 2 (8%) detailed plans to launch local ACP documents in the near future, 1 (4%) had a 'Children and Young Persons Deterioration Management (CAYPDM) Document' and 3 (12%) listed rapid discharge and extubation pathways. 6 (25%) provided details of the document in use. They varied widely in terms of their presentation, content and intended use with some having been developed locally and others having been adopted across regions. There is variation around the UK in the existence of formal ACP documents for paediatric patients with palliative care needs, as well as variation in the type of document that is used. Consideration of a national policy should be informed by further review and evaluation of these documents, as well as current practice in ACP. ",0
674,21434942,"Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone antibacterial agent","""Linezolid (Zyvox) is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics to reach the market in over 35 years; it was approved for use in 2000. A member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, linezolid is highly effective for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections and has activity that compares favorably with vancomycin for most clinically relevant pathogens. Zyvox is approved for use against serious Gram-positive infections, including those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the very challenging methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium organisms. Zyvox inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S rRNA in the catalytic site of the 50S ribosome. It can be administered both orally and intravenously and has good tissue distribution. Recent results have demonstrated that oxazolidinone analogs related to linezolid are effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis caused by resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in animal infection models and suggest additional new therapeutic applications for these antibiotics.""",1
675,22922418,Orphan kidney diseases,"Rare kidney diseases are a unique subset of renal disorders that are often termed 'orphan' as a result of a multitude of reasons: the small number of patients with the consequent lack of well-defined natural history and course of many of these diseases, limited awareness among the medical community, and finally the significant cost of developing novel therapeutics which makes many of these diseases unattractive targets for the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, in the last decade the study and clinical management of rare kidney disease patients has been the focus of many investigative efforts. In recent years we have witnessed an enormous expansion in our knowledge of the genetic nature of a number of rare kidney diseases. Moreover, the investigation of the role of genetic disruption aiming at elucidating the pathogenesis of different and complex renal diseases has helped not only in understanding the disease states, but has also given us fundamental insights into a number of kidney developmental and physiological functions. This article will give an overview of orphan renal diseases with particular emphasis on monogenic kidney diseases. It will also focus on the classification of these diseases while highlighting a prominent example in each category.  ",0
676,29183282,Bilateral muscle fiber and nerve influences by TNF-alpha in response to unilateral muscle overuse - studies on TNF receptor expressions,"TNF-alpha is suggested to be involved in muscle damage and muscle inflammation (myositis). In order to evaluate whether TNF-alpha is involved in the myositis that occurs in response to muscle overuse, the aim was to examine the expression patterns of TNF receptors in this condition. A rabbit muscle overuse model leading to myositis in the soleus muscle was used. The expression patterns of the two TNF receptors Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor type 1 (TNFR1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor type 2 (TNFR2) were investigated. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence were utilized. Immunostainings for desmin, NK-1R and CD31 were made in parallel. Immunoreactions (IR) for TNF receptors were clearly observed in white blood cells, fibroblasts and vessel walls, and most interestingly also in muscle fibers and nerve fascicles in the myositis muscles. There were very restricted reactions for these in the muscles of controls. The upregulation of TNF receptors was for all types of structures seen for both the experimental side and the contralateral nonexperimental side. TNF receptor expressing muscle fibers were present in myositis muscles. They can be related to attempts for reparation/regeneration, as evidenced from results of parallel stainings. Necrotic muscle fibers displayed TNFR1 mRNA and TNFR2 immunoreaction (IR) in the invading white blood cells. In myositis muscles, TNFR1 IR was observed in both axons and Schwann cells while TNFR2 IR was observed in Schwann cells. Such observations were very rarely made for control animals. The findings suggest that there is a pronounced involvement of TNF-alpha in the developing myositis process. Attempts for reparation of the muscle tissue seem to occur via both TNFR1 and TNFR2. As the myositis process also occurs in the nonexperimental side and as TNF receptors are confined to nerve fascicles bilaterally it can be asked whether TNF-alpha is involved in the spreading of the myositis process to the contralateral side via the nervous system. Taken together, the study shows that TNF-alpha is not only associated with the inflammation process but that both the muscular and nervous systems are affected and that this occurs both on experimental and nonexperimental sides.

677,19292803,Fiberoptic ductoscopy-guided intraductal biopsy improve the diagnosis of nipple discharge,"Fiberoptic ductoscopy (FDS)-guided intraductal biopsy is a minimally invasive technique developed to obtain pathologic diagnoses for patients with spontaneous nipple discharge. We performed biopsies of 53 intraductal lesions from March 2006 to April 2007 followed by surgical microdochectomy. FDS-guided intraductal biopsy was shown to be a minimally invasive, safe, and convenient technique with a high ability (90.6%) to get adequate samples. Twenty-seven solitary papillomas, 12 multiple intraductal papilloma, five ductal hyperplasia, three ductal carcinoma in situ, and one invasive ductal carcinoma were diagnosed. Compared with conventional microdochectomy, FDS-guided intraductal biopsy can significantly increase the detection rate of solitary papilloma (40.7% versus 92.6%, p < 0.05). It should be a routine procedure after intraductal lesion found by screening FDS. Since it would underestimate all multiple intraductal papilloma and some (50%) cancer, microdochectomy is inevitable if biopsies show atypical ductal hyperplasia. ",0

However, the adverse effects of malaria resurgences are not known. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection among 1819 Mozambican women who delivered infants between 2003 and 2012. We used microscopic and histologic examination and a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay, as well as flow-cytometric analysis of IgG antibody responses against two parasite lines. RESULTS: Positive qPCR tests for P. falciparum decreased from 33% in 2003 to 2% in 2010 and increased to 6% in 2012, with antimalarial IgG antibody responses mirroring these trends. Parasite densities in peripheral blood on qPCR assay were higher in 2010-2012 (geometric mean [�SD], 409�1569 genomes per microliter) than in 2003-2005 (44�169 genomes per microliter, P=0.02), as were parasite densities in placental blood on histologic assessment (50�39% of infected erythrocytes vs. 4�6%, P<0.001). The malaria-associated reduction in maternal hemoglobin levels was larger in 2010-2012 (10.1�1.8 g per deciliter in infected women vs. 10.9�1.7 g per deciliter in uninfected women; mean difference, -0.82 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.39 to -0.25) than in 2003-2005 (10.5�1.1 g per deciliter vs. 10.6�1.5 g per deciliter; difference, -0.12 g per deciliter; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.43), as was the reduction in birth weight (2863�440 g in women with past or chronic infections vs. 3070�482 g in uninfected women in 2010-2012; mean difference, -164.5 g; 95% CI, -289.7 to -39.4; and 2994�487 g vs. 3117�455 g in 2003-2005; difference, -44.8 g; 95% CI, -139.1 to 49.5).

Specifically, this study is interested in evaluating the reliability, consistency and concurrent and discriminant validity of this instrument. The sample was composed for a total of 400 people from four different settings: treatment centers (residential and ambulatories), primary health care, police stations and companies. The reliability of the ASSIST was high (&#945; = .86 for Alcohol, &#945; = .84 for marijuana and &#945; = .90 for cocaine). The intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) with test-retest comparison was statistically significant for Alcohol (ICC = .66), marijuana (ICC = .74) and cocaine (ICC = .80). There were statistically significant correlations between the ASSIST and the AUDIT score (Pearsons r = .85), the ASSIST and the ASI-Lite score (r between .66 and .83 for tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine), and the ASSIST and the SDS score (r = .65). The original cutoff point for high risk detection was 27 points, however, in order to have a better balance between sensitivity and specificity the cut was changed to 21 points. The ASSIST presents good psychometric properties and therefore is a reliable and valid instrument to be used as a mechanism to detect risk levels of substance use in the Chilean population.  ",0
680,1618362,Evidence of growth retardation in neonates of apparently normal weight,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of ponderal index (PI) and the ratio of mid-arm circumference to occipito-frontal circumference (MAC/OFC) to the delivered weight of the child. Measurements were made on 160 singleton neonates with birthweight greater than 2500 g and delivery at 37 weeks or more. Surprisingly, there was a highly significant correlation between PI and birthweight and MAC/OFC and birthweight. We conclude that: (1) values of PI must be evaluated in relation to birthweight, and not against a single absolute standard for the whole normal population; (2) measurement of PI and MAC/OFC may reveal a group of growth-retarded infants amongst infants of apparently 'normal' birthweight; and (3) this group of infants might be a target for the extra care normally accorded to the low birthweight infant.

681,11518285,The effects of static and intermittent compression on nitric oxide production in articular cartilage explants,"Nitric oxide (NO) production and NO synthase (NOS) expression are increased in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that NO may play a role in the destruction of articular cartilage. To test the hypothesis that mechanical stress may increase NO production by chondrocytes, we measured the effects of physiological levels of static and intermittent compression on NOS activity, NO production, and NOS antigen expression by porcine articular cartilage explants. Static compression significantly increased NO production at 0.1 MPa stress for 24 h (P < 0.05). Intermittent compression at 0.5 Hz for 6 h followed by 18 h recovery also increased NO production and NOS activity at 1.0 MPa stress (P < 0.05). Intermittent compression at 0.5 Hz for 24 h at a magnitude of 0.1 or 0.5 MPa caused an increase in NO production and NOS activity (P < 0.05). Immunoblot analysis showed stress-induced upregulation of NOS2, but not NOS1 or NOS3. There was no loss in cell viability following any of the loading regimens. Addition of 2 mM 1400 W (a specific NOS2 inhibitor) reduced NO production by 51% with no loss of cell viability. These findings indicate that NO production by chondrocytes is influenced by mechanical compression in vitro and suggest that biomechanical factors may in part regulate NO production in vivo. ",0
682,19437487,Human progenitor cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity efficiently engraft into damaged liver in a novel model,"Human cord blood stem cells (hCBSCs) have been reported to generate hepatocyte-like cells and thus hold promise for repairing damaged liver. However, the frequency of hCBSC-derived hepatocytes varies tremendously between different studies, and it is still controversial as to whether hCBSC-derived cells can transdifferentiate into hepatocytes or simply fuse to recipient hepatocytes. We used the beta-glucuronidase-deficient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (NOD/SCID/MPSVII) mouse model for better identification of engrafted cells. We transplanted lineage-depleted human umbilical cord blood-derived cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(hi)Lin(-)) into irradiated NOD/SCID/MPSVII mice followed by carbon tetrachloride administration to induced liver damage. ALDH(hi)Lin(-) cells were efficiently engrafted in the recipient mouse livers and improved recovery of the mice from toxic insult. The percentage of human cells in these livers ranged between 3% and 14.2% using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, human-originated cells expressing liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin messenger RNA, albumin and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 protein were detected in the recipient livers. Interestingly, human versus murine centromeric fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on the liver sections demonstrated that most human cells were not fused to mouse cells. However, the majority of the human originated albumin-expressing cells also carried mouse genetic material, hence were the product of cell fusion. CONCLUSION: hCBSCs or their progeny may home to the injured liver and release trophic factors that hasten tissue repair, whereas fusion of these cells with hepatocytes may occur rarely and contribute to a lesser extent to liver repair.",0

Cellular radioresistance was examined by a colony formation assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. G2 arrest induced by gamma-rays was examined by flow cytometry, and the accumulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2 proteins was analyzed using Western blotting. HeLa was more resistant (10% survival dose[D10] = 10 Gy) than MeWo (D10 = 4 Gy) to gamma-rays. In HeLa, cell cycle analysis showed that G2 arrest was induced 10 or 24 h after irradiation of 10 or 4 Gy, respectively. In contrast, no clear G2 arrest in MeWo was observed after irradiation. Western blot analysis showed that cell cycle regulators, cyclin B1 and cdc2, were accumulated in HeLa but not in MeWo. The accumulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2 reached peak levels 24-34 h after irradiation of 10 Gy, and 24 h after irradiation of 4 Gy. In addition, Hoechst staining revealed similar increase in apoptotic bodies with time after irradiation in HeLa and MeWo at isosurvival doses. Radioresistance of these human cancer cells is closely correlated with gamma-ray-induced G2 arrest, and cyclin B1 and cdc2 are possible regulators of G2 arrest. ",0

We have studied its efficacy and safety in a randomised double-blind trial. 51 patients (48 entered as matched pairs) received four monthly courses of 0.7 mg/kg cladribine or placebo (saline) given through a surgically implanted central line. Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores, demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE 0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine. We conclude that the immunosuppressive drug cladribine influences favourably the course of chronic progressive MS.",1

688,24333704,Development and validation of an indirect pulsed electrochemical detection method for monitoring the inhibition of Abl1 tyrosine kinase,"A new method for monitoring the enzyme inhibition of Abl1 tyrosine kinase by liquid chromatography-indirect pulsed electrochemical detection (LC-InPED) was developed. In this method, adsorption of a peptide analyte at the noble metal electrode suppresses the oxidation of polyols under alkaline condition to elicit an indirect response resulting in a negative peak of the target peptide. Among the reagents tested, D-gluconic acid sodium salt gave the best overall signal to noise (S/N) values for the indirect detection of p-Abltide, the product of Abl1 enzymatic reaction. 50 μM D-gluconic acid sodium salt dissolved in a mixture of 78% water-22% acetonitrile-0.03% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used as the mobile phase. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Alltima C18 (I.D. 5 μm; 250 mm × 4.6 mm) column with the mobile phase flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5M sodium hydroxide was added post-column to maintain alkaline conditions in the PED cell. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.2 μM for p-Abltide, which was about 50-fold lower than direct PED analysis. The residual plot of the linear calibration curve indicated a good fit with a linear model within the investigated concentration range of p-Abltide. Intra- and inter-day precision was not more than 6.5% and accuracy was from -5.75% to +1.54%. The validated LC-InPED method was successfully applied for monitoring of p-Abltide in Abl1 enzyme reaction and the inhibition study of Abl1. The determined IC50 values of model inhibitors, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, were 601.4 nM (R(2)=0.99), 32.3 nM (R(2)=0.99) and 1.3 nM (R(2)=0.98), respectively. These results were consistent with literature data. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a LC-InPED method has been used to monitor an enzyme reaction. ",0
689,19489072,PCSK9 impedes hepatitis C virus infection in vitro and modulates liver CD81 expression,"Human PCSK9 is known to enhance the degradation of membrane-bound receptors such as the hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), ApoER2, and very low-density lipoprotein receptor. Because the LDLR is suspected to be involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, we also tested whether PCSK9 can affect the levels of CD81, a major HCV receptor. Interestingly, stable expression of PCSK9 or a more active membrane-bound form of the protein (PCSK9-ACE2) resulted in a marked reduction in CD81 and LDLR expression. Therefore, we analyzed the antiviral effect of PCSK9 in vitro using the HCV genotype 2a (JFH1) virus. The results clearly demonstrated that cells expressing PCSK9 or PCSK9-ACE2, but not the ACE2 control protein, were resistant to HCV infection. Furthermore, addition of purified soluble PCSK9 to cell culture supernatant impeded HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, HuH7 cells expressing PCSK9-ACE2 were also resistant to infection by HCV pseudoparticles. In addition, we showed that CD81 cell surface expression is modulated by PCSK9 in an LDLR-independent manner. Finally, in the liver of single Pcsk9 and double (Pcsk9 + Ldlr) knockout mice, both LDLR and/or CD81 protein expression levels were significantly reduced, but not those of transferrin and scavenger receptor class B type 1. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an antiviral effect of the circulating liver PCSK9 on HCV in cells and show that PCSK9 down-regulates the level of mouse liver CD81 expression in vivo. Therefore, we propose that the plasma level and/or activity of PCSK9 may modulate HCV infectivity in humans.",0

Pregnancies during residency were common (one in eight married women in 1983) and were usually planned (77 percent). Most institutions were unprepared for pregnancies among members of the house staff; four fifths of the programs had no maternity-leave policy. No one quit a residency program because of pregnancy, and pregnancy rarely affected achievement of board certification. Whether the pregnant women found pregnancy during residency a """"pleasant"""" experience was determined largely by whether the program director was supportive, whether the issue of pregnancy was openly discussed within the program, and whether the woman was permitted to return to work on a part-time basis for the first weeks after maternity leave. We conclude that pregnancy within residency programs should be expected and planned for and that if proper arrangements are made, it need not be a major problem for either the training program or the pregnant resident.""",0
691,30184445,Quality of Care in the United Kingdom after Removal of Financial Incentives,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of pay-for-performance schemes in improving the quality of care remain uncertain. There is little information on the effect of removing incentives from existing pay-for-performance schemes. METHODS: We conducted interrupted time-series analyses of electronic medical record (EMR) data from 2010 to 2017 for 12 quality-of-care indicators in the United Kingdom's Quality and Outcomes Framework for which financial incentives were removed in 2014 and 6 indicators for which incentives were maintained. We estimated the effects of removing incentives on changes in performance on quality-of-care measures. RESULTS: Complete longitudinal data were available for 2819 English primary care practices with more than 20 million registered patients. There were immediate reductions in documented quality of care for all 12 indicators in the first year after the removal of financial incentives. Reductions were greatest for indicators related to health advice, with a reduction of 62.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -65.6 to -59.0) in EMR documentation of lifestyle counseling for patients with hypertension. Changes were smaller for indicators involving clinical actions that automatically update the EMR, such as laboratory testing, with a reduction of 10.7 percentage points (95% CI, -13.6 to -7.8) in control of cholesterol in patients with coronary heart disease and 12.1 percentage points (95% CI, -13.6 to -10.6) for thyroid-function testing in patients with hypothyroidism. There was little change in performance on the 6 quality measures for which incentives were maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Removal of financial incentives was associated with an immediate decline in performance on quality measures. In part, the decline probably reflected changes in EMR documentation, but declines on measures involving laboratory testing suggest that incentive removal also changed the care delivered.",0

First, we reviewed the prescription of aldosterone antagonists among 408 patients presenting to the cardiology clinic at a major hospital in Jordan. Second, physicians and pharmacists working in cardiovascular departments completed a questionnaire related to use of aldosterone antagonists in HF and post-MI. Thirty patients (7.59%) were eligible for aldosterone antagonist; only 4 received them at discharge (13.3%). The survey was completed by 153 professionals (response rate 76.12%). About 72.1% of participants were aware of studies regarding use of aldosterone antagonists post-MI and in HF. Moreover, 10.45%/53.6% of participants strongly agreed/agreed that these agents are useful in normotensive post-MI and HF patients. Spironolactone was the most prescribed drug by 92.1% of participants. About 41.8% of participants reported use of spironolactone in post-MI and HF. With respect to guidelines, only 39.2% of participants agreed that adding spironolactone to standard therapy in HF is recommended, and 48.3% agreed on adding it directly post-MI. Clinical pharmacists and cardiologists were generally more aware of guidelines than pharmacists, cardiac surgeons and residents/fellows. there is an under-use of aldosterone antagonists in HF and post-MI patients, and a lack of detailed awareness of current guidelines among health care providers. Dissemination of evidence-based guidelines and usage protocols may improve management of post-MI and HF. ",0

695,10386080,Meta-analysis: when and how,"Systematic reviews have a central role in evidence-based medicine. The quantitative systematic review, also known as meta-analysis, provides a logical structure for quantifying evidence and for exploring bias and diversity in research systematically. It is essential that clinicians, educators, and researchers understand the methods that comprise this research tool, particularly the basic step-by-step process, and know when numerical pooling of data is appropriate. The essay describes how systematic reviews are best conducted and when statistical pooling of data is appropriate. Systematic reviews are scientific investigations with planned methods that use original studies as subjects and synthesize the results of multiple studies using strategies to limit bias and random error. This process requires judgments to be made explicit, and should be question driven, protocol based, reproducible, and comprehensive in scope. Meta-analysis provides a framework for research synthesis, increases power and precision, provides an overall estimate and range of effect, and identifies greater-than-expected variability among study results (heterogeneity). Meta-analysis does not remove subjectivity from the process of synthesis, identify sources of variability among studies, or obviate the need for sound, compassionate clinical reasoning. Statistical heterogeneity should be anticipated and welcomed. It forces a consideration of clinical heterogeneity as well as variation in study protocol and quality. Statistical tests for homogeneity are insensitive and do not indicate sources of heterogeneity, making such consideration imperative. The most common and popular measures of efficacy for a meta-analysis are the standardized difference between two means, the relative risk, and the odds ratio. An additional measure, the number needed to treat, with its 95% confidence interval is the most clinically useful measure of the effects of an intervention and is useful for comparing the relative effectiveness of different interventions for the same condition. Important parts of meta-analysis and sensitivity and subgroup analyses are best considered a priori and should be used to explore heterogeneity and to test for publication bias and variation in study quality.",0
696,18376233,Phase II study of imatinib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"""BACKGROUND: The expression of platelet-derived growth factor, a potent mitogen, and its receptor both in tissue and serum correlate with the severity of liver cirrhosis. Over-expression of platelet-derived growth factor has been demonstrated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors and cell lines. Imatinib, a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL and c-kit, also inhibits the platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. The trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of imatinib in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: Eligibility criteria consisted of HCC patient over the age of 18 with reasonable organ function, unresectable but measurable disease, not candidates for chemoinfusion, and a performance status of 0 to 2. Imatinib was started at 300 mg/d orally with 100 mg/wk dose escalation up to 800 mg/d if toxicity permitted. RESULTS: Fifteen patients, median age 58 years, were enrolled and treated with imatinib. Most, or 7, patients had hepatitis B virus as a risk factor for HCC, followed by hepatitis C virus in 3 patients. Metastatic disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV) was noted in 13 patients and locally advanced (stage III) in the remainder. The median dose-level of imatinib was 500 mg/d. Two patients had stable disease lasting more than 2 months. The remainder progressed within 2 months of initiation of imatinib. No grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was observed. Two patients had grade 3 elevated liver function tests during treatment; otherwise, there was no other grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity noted. CONCLUSION: Although toxicities were tolerable, imatinib as a monotherapy for the treatment of unresectable HCC has little, if any, significant efficacy.""",1

698,25423189,Structure of putrescine aminotransferase from Escherichia coli provides insights into the substrate specificity among class III aminotransferases,"YgjG is a putrescine aminotransferase enzyme that transfers amino groups from compounds with terminal primary amines to compounds with an aldehyde group using pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. Previous biochemical data show that the enzyme prefers primary diamines, such as putrescine, over ornithine as a substrate. To better understand the enzyme's substrate specificity, crystal structures of YgjG from Escherichia coli were determined at 2.3 and 2.1 Å resolutions for the free and putrescine-bound enzymes, respectively. Sequence and structural analyses revealed that YgjG forms a dimer that adopts a class III PLP-dependent aminotransferase fold. A structural comparison between YgjG and other class III aminotransferases revealed that their structures are similar. However, YgjG has an additional N-terminal helical structure that partially contributes to a dimeric interaction with the other subunit via a helix-helix interaction. Interestingly, the YgjG substrate-binding site entrance size and charge distribution are smaller and more hydrophobic than other class III aminotransferases, which suggest that YgjG has a unique substrate binding site that could accommodate primary aliphatic diamine substrates, including putrescine. The YgjG crystal structures provide structural clues to putrescine aminotransferase substrate specificity and binding.  ",0
699,1371982,"Differences in the abundance of variably spliced transcripts for the second asialoglycoprotein receptor polypeptide, H2, in normal and transformed human liver","The human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor comprises two homologous polypeptides designated H1 and H2. Two distinct complementary DNA clones encoding these receptor subunits have been previously isolated from the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. We discovered that multiple variants of H2 transcripts exist both in HepG2 cells and in the normal human liver that, at least in part, appear to be the result of alternative splicing events. We have found that (a) the complementary DNA clone for H2 previously isolated from HepG2 cells, characterized by a 57-nucleotide insertion within the 5' end of the complementary DNA that is absent from H1, represented only one third of H2-related sequences in an unamplified normal human liver complementary DNA library and less than 10% of H2 clones in HepG2 cells; (b) the predominant message for H2 expressed in the liver and HepG2 cells, designated L-H2, appeared to represent the fully processed product of the gene encoding both L-H2 and H2; and (c) a variant H2 transcript existed in HepG2 cells, designated H2', that contained a novel, 5' 88-bp nucleotide insertion. Poly(A+) RNA analysis of the normal liver and HepG2 cells by complementary RNA hybridization and ribonuclease protection corroborated the observations made during the screening of complementary DNA libraries regarding the abundance of the various messages. A striking incongruity was found between the levels of messenger RNA containing the H2-specific 57-nucleotide sequence and the levels of polypeptide expressed in the liver and HepG2 cells as recognized by antiserum specifically raised against this sequence.",0
700,21358399,Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome: a review,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review are to summarize the definitions, causes, and clinical course as well as the current understanding of the genetic background, mechanism of disease, and therapy of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched using the terms toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug toxicity, drug interaction, and skin diseases. DATA SYNTHESIS: Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are acute inflammatory skin reactions. The onset is usually triggered by infections of the upper respiratory tract or by preceding medication, among which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants are the most common triggers. Initially the diseases present with unspecific symptoms, followed by more or less extensive blistering and shedding of the skin. Complete death of the epidermis leads to sloughing similar to that seen in large burns. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is the most severe form of drug-induced skin reaction and includes denudation of >30% of total body surface area. Stevens-Johnson syndrome affects <10%, whereas involvement of 10%-30% of body surface area is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap. Besides the skin, mucous membranes such as oral, genital, anal, nasal, and conjunctival mucosa are frequently involved in toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is associated with a significant mortality of 30%-50% and long-term sequelae. Treatment includes early admission to a burn unit, where treatment with precise fluid, electrolyte, protein, and energy supplementation, moderate mechanical ventilation, and expert wound care can be provided. Specific treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or immunoglobulins did not show an improved outcome in most studies and remains controversial. The mechanism of disease is not completely understood, but immunologic mechanisms, cytotoxic reactions, and delayed hypersensitivity seem to be involved. CONCLUSION: Profound knowledge of exfoliative skin diseases is needed to improve therapy and outcome of these life-threatening illnesses.",1

Enteric exposure to anthrax, which is difficult to detect or prevent in a timely manner, could be exploited as an act of terror through contamination of human or animal food. Our group has developed a novel animal model of gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax for evaluation of disease pathogenesis and experimental therapeutics, utilizing vegetative Bacillus anthracis (Sterne strain) administered to A/J mice (a complement-deficient strain) by oral gavage. We hypothesized that a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) * that neutralizes the protective antigen (PA) component of B. anthracis lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) could be an effective treatment. Although the efficacy of this anti-anthrax PA mAb has been shown in animal models of inhalational anthrax, its activity in GI infection had not yet been ascertained. We hereby demonstrate that passive immunotherapy with anti-anthrax PA mAb, administered at the same time as gastrointestinal exposure to B. anthracis, prevents lethal sepsis in nearly all cases (>90%), while a delay of up to forty-eight hours in treatment still greatly reduces mortality following exposure (65%). Moreover, passive immunotherapy protects against enteric invasion, associated mucosal injury and subsequent dissemination by gastrointestinal B. anthracis, indicating that it acts to prevent the initial stages of infection. * Expired raxibacumab being cycled off the Strategic National Stockpile; biological activity confirmed by in vitro assay.""",1

This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy including BOC or TVR in combination with PR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients under real-life conditions. METHODS: In a multicentre study conducted in 24 sites throughout five European countries, all HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who initiated a combination of BOC or TVR plus PR and who had at least 60 weeks of follow-up, were analyzed. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the scheduled end of therapy date (SVR12) and the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events (AE) were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 159 subjects included, 127 (79.9%) were male, 45 (34.4%) were treatment-na?ve for PR and 60 (45.4%) showed cirrhosis. SVR12 was observed in 31/46 (67.4%) patients treated with BOC and 69/113 (61.1%) patients treated with TVR. Overall discontinuations due to AE rates were 8.7% for BOC and 8% for TVR.

We conducted a randomized trial in which such patients were treated with either an augmented intensive regimen of post-induction chemotherapy or a standard regimen of intensive post-induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Between January 1991 and June 1995, 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were either 1 to 9 years of age with white-cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter or 10 years of age or older, had a slow response to initial therapy, and entered remission at the end of induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (156 children) or augmented therapy (155). Those with lymphomatous features were excluded. Event-free survival and overall survival were assessed from the end of induction treatment. RESULTS: The outcome at five years was significantly better in the augmented-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival [+/-SD]: 75.0+/-3.8 vs. 55.0+/-4.5 percent, P<0.001; overall survival: 78.4+/-3.7 vs. 66.7+/-4.2 percent, P=0.02). The difference between treatments was most pronounced among patients one to nine years of age, all of whom had white-cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter (P<0.001). Risk factors for an adverse event in the entire cohort included a white-cell count of 200,000 per cubic millimeter or higher (P=0.004), race other than black or white (P<0.001), and the presence of a t(9;22) translocation (P=0.007). The toxic effects of augmented therapy were considerable but manageable.

Entry was restricted to patients with idiopathic PD who were not receiving levodopa. Pramipexole was administered according to an ascending dose schedule up to 4.5 mg/d. During the 7-week dose-escalation phase, each subject was titrated to his or her maximally tolerated dose of study medication. This was followed by a 24-week period of maintenance therapy. The mean daily dose during the maintenance period was 3.8 mg.

Serious adverse events were reported in 42%; most were related to underlying disease. The pharmacokinetic profile of CHO-derived siltuximab appears similar to the previous cell line. No objective responses occurred; 5 of 84 patients had stable disease >6 weeks. Hemoglobin increased ?1.5 g/dL in 33 of 47 patients. At 11 and 15 mg/kg, completely sustained C-reactive protein suppression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Siltuximab monotherapy appears to be well tolerated but without clinical activity in solid tumors, including ovarian and KRAS-mutant cancers. The recommended phase II doses were 11 and 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks.""",1
713,25708601,Measuring the reactivity of commercially available zero-valent iron nanoparticles used for environmental remediation with iopromide,"The high specific surface area and high reactivity of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) particles have led to much research on their application to environmental remediation. The reactivity of nZVI is affected by both the water chemistry and the properties of the particular type of nZVI particle used. We have investigated the reactivity of three types of commercially available Nanofer particles (from Nanoiron, s.r.o., Czech Republic) that are currently either used in, or proposed for use in full scale environmental remediation projects. The performance of one of these, the air-stable and thus easy-to-handle Nanofer Star particle, has not previously been reported. Experiments were carried out first in batch shaking reactors in order to derive maximum reactivity rates and provide a rapid estimate of the Nanofer particle's reactivity. The experiments were performed under near-natural environmental conditions with respect to the pH value of water and solute concentrations, and results were compared with those obtained using synthetic water. Thereafter, the polyelectrolyte-coated Nanofer 25S particles (having the highest potential for transport within porous media) were chosen for the experiments in column reactors, in order to elucidate nanoparticle reactivity under a more field-site realistic setting. Iopromide was rapidly dehalogenated by the investigated nZVI particles, following pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics that was independent of the experimental conditions. The specific surface area normalized reaction rate constant (kSA) value in the batch reactors ranged between 0.12 and 0.53Lm(-2)h(-1); it was highest for the uncoated Nanofer 25 particles, followed by the polyacrylic acid-coated Nanofer 25S and air-stable Nanofer Star particles. In the batch reactors all particles were less reactive in natural water than in synthetic water. The kSA values derived from the column reactor experiments were about 1000 times lower than those from the batch reactors, ranging between 2.6×10(-4) and 5.7×10(-4)Lm(-2)h(-1). Our results revealed that the easy-to-handle and air-stable Nanofer Star particles are the least reactive of all the Nanofer products tested. The reaction kinetics predicted by column experiments were more realistic than those predicted by batch experiments and these should therefore be used when designing a full-scale field application of nanomaterials for environmental remediation.

714,25821156,The pharmacokinetics and safety of idelalisib in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment,"Idelalisib, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor, is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase to form GS-563117, an inactive metabolite, and is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 3A and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4. In a mass balance study, the orally administered idelalisib dose was recovered mainly in feces ( approximately 78%). This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single 150-mg dose of idelalisib in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and in age-, sex-, and weight-matched, healthy controls. The idelalisib maximum observed plasma concentration was generally comparable in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment versus healthy controls, whereas the mean area under the curve was higher (58% to 59%). GS-563117 exposures were lower in impaired versus healthy control subjects, likely because of lower formation in the setting of liver impairment. Exploratory analyses indicated no relevant relationships between idelalisib or GS-563117 plasma exposures and Child-Pugh-Turcotte scores. Single oral doses of idelalisib 150 mg were well tolerated, with most treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities being grades 1 or 2 in severity. As such, no dose adjustment was required when initiating idelalisib treatment in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, although close monitoring for potential AEs is recommended.",1
715,31407113,Lipid nanoparticles as vehicles for oral delivery of insulin and insulin analogs: preliminary ex vivo and in vivo studies,"Subcutaneous administration of insulin in patients suffering from diabetes is associated with the distress of daily injections. Among alternative administration routes, the oral route seems to be the most advantageous for long-term administration, also because the peptide undergoes a hepatic first-pass effect, contributing to the inhibition of the hepatic glucose output. Unfortunately, insulin oral administration has so far been hampered by degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes and poor intestinal absorption. Loading in lipid nanoparticles should allow to overcome these limitations. Entrapment of peptides into such nanoparticles is not easy, because of their high molecular weight, hydrophilicity and thermo-sensitivity. In this study, this objective was achieved by employing fatty acid coacervation method: solid lipid nanoparticles and newly engineered nanostructured lipid carriers were formulated. Insulin and insulin analog-glargine insulin-were entrapped in the lipid matrix through hydrophobic ion pairing. Bioactivity of lipid entrapped peptides was demonstrated through a suitable in vivo experiment. Ex vivo and in vivo studies were carried out by employing fluorescently labelled peptides. Gut tied up experiments showed the superiority of glargine insulin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers, which demonstrated significantly higher permeation (till 30% dose/mL) compared to free peptide. Approximately 6% absolute bioavailability in the bloodstream was estimated for the same formulation through in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats. Consequently, a discrete blood glucose responsivity was noted in healthy animals. Given the optimized ex vivo and in vivo intestinal uptake of glargine insulin from nanostructured lipid carriers, further studies will be carried out on healthy and diabetic rat models in order to establish a glargine insulin dose-glucose response relation.

716,11147510,COMT inhibitors and liver toxicity,"This paper reviews the issue of hepatotoxicity with the use of the catechol-O-methly transferase (COMT) inhibitors tolcapone and entacapone. Neither drug caused hepatotoxicity in preclinical toxicity testing. However, in clinical trials of tolcapone, liver chemistry tests were elevated more than 3 times above the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% of patients who took the 100 mg dose and in approximately 3% of patients who took the 200 mg dose. These observations led to the recommendation that periodic monitoring of liver function be performed. Post-marketing surveillance studies noted 3 instances of acute liver failure with death after 60,000 patients had received tolcapone for a total of 40,000 patient-years. For this reason, the drug was withdrawn from the market in Europe and Canada, and a black box warning issued in the United States. In contrast, clinical trials with entacapone demonstrated no increase in liver enzymes above those observed with placebo. Further, no instances of acute liver failure or death attributed to the drug have been observed in post-marketing surveillance studies. Consequently, liver monitoring is not required with this agent. These data demonstrate that tolcapone is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity but that no such risk has been detected with entacapone.",1
717,19581834,Circulatory recovery is as fast with air ventilation as with 100% oxygen after asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest in piglets,"We investigated return of spontaneous circulation and of cerebral oxygenation after asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest, using ventilation with air, throughout, or with 100% oxygen for a shorter or longer period. Arterial pressure, heart rate, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (CrSO2), and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2) were measured in 1-d-old piglets that were hypoventilated with air and left in apnea until cardiac arrest. They were randomly assigned to be resuscitated with air (n = 13), or with oxygen for 3 (n = 12) or 30 min (n = 13) and then with air. Nine, 10, and 10 animals, respectively, needed closed chest cardiac massage. One, none, and one, respectively, died. Median (quartile range) times from start of ventilation until heart rate reached 150 bpm were 67 (60-76), 88 (76-126), and 68 (56-81) s. They were not significantly different, nor were the arterial pressure responses, times until CrSO2 reached 30%, or times until PbtO2 had increased by 0.1 kPa from its nadir. Peak PbtO2 values during resuscitation were 4.2 (3.3-5.4), 12 (6.4-15), and 25 (15-36) kPa. Thus, pure oxygen did not accelerate the recovery of circulation or of cerebral oxygenation, while even a brief exposure caused cerebral hyperoxia. ",0
718,22544759,CD11b(+) Gr1(+) bone marrow cells ameliorate liver fibrosis by producing interleukin-10 in mice,"Clinical trials and animal models suggest that infusion of bone marrow cells (BMCs) is effective therapy for liver fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms are obscure, especially those associated with early effects of BMCs. Here, we analyzed the early impact of BMC infusion and identified the subsets of BMCs showing antifibrotic effects in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis. An interaction between BMCs and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was investigated using an in vitro coculturing system. Within 24 hours, infused BMCs were in close contact with activated HSCs, which was associated with reduced liver fibrosis, enhanced hepatic expression of interleukin (IL)-10, and expanded regulatory T cells but decreased macrophage infiltration in the liver at 24 hours after BMC infusion. In contrast, IL-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-) ) BMCs failed to reproduce these effects in fibrotic livers. Intriguingly, in isolated cells, CD11b(+) Gr1(high) F4/80(-) and CD11b(+) Gr1(+) F4/80(+) BMCs expressed more IL-10 after coculturing with activated HSCs, leading to suppressed expression of collagen and ?-smooth muscle actin in HSCs. Moreover, these effects were either enhanced or abrogated, respectively, when BMCs were cocultured with IL-6(-/-) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1(-/-) HSCs. Similar to murine data, human BMCs expressed more IL-10 after coculturing with human HSC lines (LX-2 or hTERT), and serum IL-10 levels were significantly elevated in patients with liver cirrhosis after autologous BMC infusion. CONCLUSION: Activated HSCs increase IL-10 expression in BMCs (CD11b(+) Gr1(high) F4/80(-) and CD11b(+) Gr1(+) F4/80(+) cells), which in turn ameliorates liver fibrosis. Our findings could enhance the design of BMC therapy for liver fibrosis.",0
719,18031103,Aldesleukin (recombinant interleukin-2),"Aldesleukin [recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2)] is a biological response modifier which, like endogenous IL-2, has a range of immunomodulatory properties. Although aldesleukin is currently approved only for treatment of renal cell carcinoma, it has been widely used in patients with metastatic melanoma and has been assessed in numerous noncomparative trials in this indication. Durable complete responses have been reported in a small proportion of patients with good performance status who received immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy involving aldesleukin in several clinical trials. Overall median survival times of about 10 or 11 months are typical. Combination chemoimmunotherapy involving aldesleukin has produced relatively high response rates (up to 56%), but these are not predictive of increased survival time. Aldesleukin has not been directly compared with standard chemotherapy in randomised studies. The use of continuous intravenous infusion and subcutaneous administration of aldesleukin, together with improved patient selection, has successfully reduced the severity of adverse events produced by the drug (the original intravenous bolus regimen is particularly toxic and often necessitates admission to an intensive care unit). However, the risk/benefit profile of aldesleukin in the treatment of melanoma requires further study, particularly after subcutaneous administration. Thus, aldesleukin has shown modest efficacy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Although aldesleukin-containing regimens have produced promising results in many noncomparative trials, their clinical value in comparison with standard chemotherapy remains to be determined in phase III studies. Until results from such trials are available, clinicians will need to carefully balance the potential benefits of the drug against the risks and likely quality-of-life implications associated with its toxicity in each patient. Current investigations centre on the use of aldesleukin as part of complex biochemotherapy regimens, and results from these trials are awaited with interest.",1

721,29886412,Use of non-invasive ventilation in cerebral palsy,"Patients with cerebral palsy (CP), especially those at the severe end of the spectrum (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV-V equivalent), frequently suffer from sleep disturbance and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly used in this patient group, albeit with little published evidence of its effectiveness in CP. This article aims to review the current evidence in the use of NIV in children with CP, highlighting areas of uncertainties, as well as the balance of potential risks, challenges and benefits. We would also share our experience and practical considerations in using NIV to manage SDB in this group of patients. Between January 2010 and December 2016, 21 patients (median age 11.1 (range 1.7-16.1) years) with CP were initiated on NIV at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children following diagnosis of moderate to severe SDB on cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Over half of our patients with CP (n=11) failed to establish on NIV either due to intolerance of mask and/or ventilation pressure at the initial trial in hospital, or poor adherence during follow-up, in contrast to the overall failure rate of 8.7% among total patient population commenced on NIV. Children with CP constitute a relatively small but challenging group of patients. Decision to undertake NIV should be individualised, based on benefit outweighing the risk and burden of the treatment. ",0
722,2327848,Methotrexate-induced cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation in three patients with psoriasis. A word of caution in light of the expanding use of this 'steroid-sparing' agent,"Methotrexate has been used for many years to treat refractory psoriasis. Three cases of methotrexate-induced cirrhosis requiring orthotopic liver transplantation are presented to emphasize the importance of strict adherence to published criteria for patient selection, monitoring of cumulative drug dosages, and the performance of serial liver biopsies. Each patient had been treated with long-term methotrexate therapy (cumulative doses far in excess of 1.5 g) without undergoing serial liver biopsies, contrary to well-established treatment guidelines. Caution must be exercised in using methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of inflammatory diseases because of its potential to cause severe hepatotoxic effects with long-term usage and cumulative doses above 1.5 g. Patients easily become psychologically dependent on the drug, and physicians need to guard against the false sense of security engendered by normal results on liver function studies.",1

This pilot study assesses relationships between perceived stress, quality of life (QOL), and self-reported pain ratings as an indicator of symptom management in patients who self-reported gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the full sample (n = 402) perceived stress positively correlated with depression (r = 0.76, P < .0001), fatigue (r = 0.38, P < .0001), sleep disturbance (r = 0.40, P < .0001), average pain (r = 0.26, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.25, P < .0001). Higher perceived stress also correlated with lower mental health-related QOL. Similar correlations were found for the participants with GERD (n = 188), IBS (n = 132), and IBD (n = 82). Finally, there were significant correlations in the GERD cohort between perceived stress, and average pain (r = 0.34, P < .0001) and worst pain (r = 0.29, P < .0001), and in the IBD cohort between perceived stress, and average pain (r = 0.32, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.35, P < .01). Perceived stress broadly correlated with QOL characteristics in patients with GERD, IBS, and IBD, and their overall QOL was significantly lower than the general population. Perceived stress also appeared to be an indicator of symptom management (self-reported pain ratings) in GERD and IBD, but not IBS. While future research using objective measures of stress and symptom/disease management is needed to confirm these associations, as well as to evaluate the ability of stress reduction interventions to improve perceived stress, QOL and disease management in these GI disorders, integrative medicine treatment programs would be most beneficial to study.

The geometric mean cut-off concentrations of schizont maturation (GMCOC) were 943.2 nM for lumefantrine, 146.3 nM for DBB and 182.2 nM for the 999:1 combination of lumefantrine and DBB. The EC(50) values were 27.3 nM for lumefantrine, 5.7 nM for DBB, and 16.5 nM for the combination, and the EC(90) values 163.1 nM for lumefantrine, 44.1 nM for DBB, and 78.3 nM for the combination. Despite the very low concentration in the combination, DBB exerted significant synergistic activity with lumefantrine that was strongest at the EC(90) and EC(99) levels. Correlation analysis indicates that DBB is the leading determinant for the activity of the combination. ",0

FTC and clevudine (CLV) have activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). This report summarizes the results of a double-blind, multicenter study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had completed a phase 3 study of FTC and were randomized 1:1 to 200 mg FTC once daily (QD) plus 10 mg CLV QD or 200 mg FTC QD plus placebo for 24 weeks with 24 weeks of follow-up. One hundred sixty-three patients were treated (82 with FTC plus CLV [FTC+CLV] and 81 with FTC); 72% were men, 53% were Asian, 47% were Caucasian, and 52% were hepatitis B e antigen positive, and the median baseline HBV DNA level was 6 log(10) copies/ml. After 24 weeks of treatment, 74% (FTC+CLV) versus 65% (FTC alone) had serum HBV DNA levels of <4,700 copies/ml (P = 0.114) (Digene HBV Hybrid Capture II assay). Twenty-four weeks posttreatment, the mean change in serum HBV DNA levels from baseline was -1.25 log(10) copies/ml (FTC+CLV), 40% had undetectable viremia (versus 23% for FTC alone), and 63% had normal alanine aminotransferase levels (versus 42% for FTC alone) (P < or = 0.025 for all endpoints). The safety profile was similar between arms during treatment, with less posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B in the combination arm.

727,17974748,Treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with a stimulant transdermal patch: the clinical art,"Stimulant medications (amphetamine and methylphenidate) are the best-documented treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but their short pharmacokinetic and behavioral half-lives have historically produced irksome time-course effects. New drug-delivery systems designed to eliminate the need for frequent dosing include the methylphenidate transdermal system, in which the matrix acts as both the drug reservoir and the skin adhesive. The methylphenidate transdermal system patch, in contrast to long-acting oral preparations, requires a paradigmatic shift in clinical thinking, as well as refinement of clinical management skills. For dosing with the methylphenidate transdermal system patch, clinicians must think in terms of a retrievable form of drug delivery (in milligrams per hour) rather than a fixed nonretrievable dose (in milligrams per dose or milligrams per day). Clinicians and patients can determine the optimal clinical dose by controlling 2 variables: (1) patch size (controlling milligrams per hour) and (2) duration of patch wear. The new paradigm is worth learning, because the patch offers several advantages over oral preparations for some patients, chiefly individualized control over effect duration (determined by when the patch is applied in the morning and removed in the afternoon/evening). Taking full advantage of this treatment option requires educating the patient and parents regarding practical elements of daily use. These elements include patch-site selection, application techniques, management of wear time to optimize the daily time course of clinical benefits, and skin hygiene. This article summarizes clinical principles that physicians may find useful in managing this new addition to the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treatment armamentarium. ",0
728,7676242,Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid versus amoxicillin plus gentamicin in the empirical initial treatment of urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients],"We compared the fixed combination amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid with that of amoxicillin plus gentamicin in the empirical initial treatment of severe urinary tract infections. The study included 87 hospitalized patients (51 women and 36 men, mean age 58 +/- 22 years) with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (n = 48) or with complicated urinary tract infections (n = 39). 80 patients (92%) had fever and 31 patients (36%) positive blood cultures. 45 patients were randomly assigned to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and 42 to amoxicillin plus gentamicin. Overall, 18 patients (21%) were infected with organisms resistant in vitro to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, whereas no pathogen was isolated with resistance to amoxicillin plus gentamicin (p < 0.0001). At the end of the empirical treatment (4.2 +/- 1.5 days after the start), significant bacteriuria was present in 6/39 patients (15%) assigned to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, compared to 0/34 patients assigned to amoxicillin plus gentamicin (p < 0.05). The clinical response was satisfactory in both groups, and the time from start of therapy to resolution of fever was 2.2 +/- 1.4 days in the amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid group and 2.3 +/- 1.7 days in the amoxicillin plus gentamicin group. Although the in-vitro resistance did not result in a lower clinical efficacy of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid compared to amoxicillin plus gentamicin in our relatively small sample of patients, the data indicate that the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid is inadequate to cover the spectrum of causative agents in hospitalized patients with pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infections. Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid should therefore not be used in the initial empirical treatment of these infections. ",0

METHODS: In this 24-week, double-blind, phase IIb study, patients with active RA (n = 507) were randomized to receive placebo or tofacitinib (20 mg/day, 1 mg twice daily, 3 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, or 15 mg twice daily). All patients continued to receive a stable dosage of MTX. The primary end point was the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12. RESULTS: At week 12, ACR20 response rates for patients receiving all tofacitinib dosages ?3 mg twice daily (52.9% for 3 mg twice daily, 50.7% for 5 mg twice daily, 58.1% for 10 mg twice daily, 56.0% for 15 mg twice daily, and 53.8% for 20 mg/day) were significantly (P ? 0.05) greater than those for placebo (33.3%). Improvements were sustained at week 24 for the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses, scores for the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, the 3-variable Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP), and a 3-variable DAS28-CRP of <2.6. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in >10% of patients in any tofacitinib group were diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache; 21 patients (4.1%) experienced serious adverse events.

737,9141440,"Hrp12, a novel heat-responsive, tissue-specific, phosphorylated protein isolated from mouse liver","Previous studies from this laboratory identified a 28-kd nonreducible protein, liver-derived immunoinhibitory factor (LDIF) from the mouse liver. Isolation of this protein resulted in the co-purification of another unique protein called heat responsive protein 12 kd (Hrp12). In contrast to LDIF, Hrp12 was totally reducible to a protein of 12 kd suggesting a dimer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) purification, followed by sequencing of an in situ cyanogen bromide digest of membrane bound Hrp12, yielded an internal 20-amino acid polypeptide. Degenerate oligonucleotides made from this peptide were used to screen a murine liver complementary DNA (cDNA) library. A 1240-bp cDNA clone was obtained with an internal 521-bp open reading frame (ORF). Sequence analysis of the 173-amino acid ORF of mouse Hrp12 showed a high degree of homology with a 99 amino acid rat liver-kidney perchloric acid-soluble protein (LKPS) and a 136-amino acid perchloric acid soluble rat protein (PSP). Transcripts for Hrp12 were mainly restricted to the liver and kidney in mouse and man. The protein was estimated to be approximately 0.8% of the total liver-soluble cytosolic protein. A zoo-blot probed at moderate stringency with labeled cDNA revealed a strong conservation of the gene in all of the mammalian species tested. Analysis of the protein structure of Hrp12 revealed motifs predicted to be targets for protein kinase C (PKC). More importantly, purified mouse Hrp12 could be phosphorylated in vitro with PKC. The protein had significant similarity to DnaK heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and contained a 54-amino acid stretch with sequence similarity to Hsp90. This prompted us to investigate the heat shock response of Hrp12. Isolated hepatocytes and hepatoma cells were exposed to different heat shock temperatures (39.5 degrees C, 42.5 degrees C, and 44.5 degrees C); and then total RNA was extracted and Northern analysis carried out. The message for this novel protein responded atypically to heat shock. Although the steady-state level of the message increased after heat shock, a marked oscillatory pattern was superimposed on it. In contrast, the steady-state levels of Hsp90 and Hsp70 messenger RNA (mRNA) were found to respond to heat shock in the expected manner. Finally, the amount of Hrp12 protein was also found to increase after heat shock in a manner that was consistent with heat-responsive proteins.",0
738,17526025,Redox-dependent and ligand-independent trans-activation of insulin receptor by globular adiponectin,"Adiponectin/ACRP30 is an adipose tissue-derived hormone with antiatherogenic, antidiabetic, and insulin-sensitizing properties. Although the metabolic effects of adiponectin on glucose and lipid metabolism are well known, the signaling pathways triggered by adiponectin receptors remain to be elucidated. We report evidence that in hepatic cells, adiponectin stimulation produces a transient burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and 5-lypoxigenase. Furthermore, adiponectin-induced oxidants cause the oxidation/inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B, one of the major phosphotyrosine phosphatases involved in the control of insulin receptor phosphorylation. Adiponectin causes increased association of PTP1B to insulin receptor and the oxidation/inhibition of the phosphatase, ultimately provoking the ligand-independent trans-phosphorylation of insulin receptor. We also report evidence that redox signaling plays a key role in both mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and hepatic glucose consumption induced by adiponectin. CONCLUSION: These results point to ROS as critical regulators of the cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin pathways and provide a redox-based molecular mechanism for the insulin-sensitizing function of adiponectin.",0
739,2019372,Ceftriaxone-associated gallbladder sludge. Identification of calcium-ceftriaxone salt as a major component of gallbladder precipitate,"Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is partially excreted into bile. With its clinical use, the formation of gallbladder sludge detected by ultrasonography has been reported. Four surgical specimens were examined and no gallstones were found. Instead, fine precipitates of 20-250 microns were present. Microscopically, there was a small number of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and bilirubin granules among an abundant amount of granular-crystalline material that was not morphologically cholesterol monohydrate crystals. The chemical composition of the precipitates (n = 4) was determined. There was a small amount of cholesterol (1.7% +/- 0.8%) and bilirubin (13.9% +/- 0.74%). The major component of the precipitate was a residue. On further analysis using thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electron microprobe analysis, the residue was identified as a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The residue also had identical crystal morphology and chromatographic elution profile as authentic calcium-ceftriaxone standards. It is concluded that ceftriaxone, after excretion and being concentrated in the gallbladder bile, can form a precipitate. The major constituent has been identified as a ceftriaxone-calcium salt.",1
740,6973390,Phase I study of 2'-deoxycoformycin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"2'-Deoxycoformycin (2'-dCF), a tight-binding inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, was administered to 26 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a Phase I study. Doses ranged from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg given i.v. for 3 consecutive days. Common toxicity included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatocellular enzyme elevations, and conjunctivitis. Lymphopenia occurred in all patients. The most serious adverse effects were acute tubular necrosis and central nervous system toxicity, which appeared to be dose related. In addition, two patients given the 0.75-mg/kg dose developed severe hepatic toxicity, although this could not be ascribed definitively to 2'-dCF. Antitumor activity was observed in eight patients, two of whom experienced a complete remission. Inhibition of lymphoblast adenosine deaminase activity was noted in the majority of cases and was observed at all doses. Antileukemic activity occurred at doses of 2'-dCF which were not associated with limiting toxicities. These results suggest that 2'-dCF is active against acute lymphoblastic leukemia and that a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day be utilized in Phase II studies.",1
741,21991951,Randomized trial of oral teriflunomide for relapsing multiple sclerosis,"""BACKGROUND: Teriflunomide is a new oral disease-modifying therapy for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: We concluded a randomized trial involving 1088 patients with multiple sclerosis, 18 to 55 years of age, with a score of 0 to 5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and at least one relapse in the previous year or at least two relapses in the previous 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to placebo, 7 mg of teriflunomide, or 14 mg of teriflunomide once daily for 108 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate, and the key secondary end point was confirmed progression of disability for at least 12 weeks. RESULTS: Teriflunomide reduced the annualized relapse rate (0.54 for placebo vs. 0.37 for teriflunomide at either 7 or 14 mg), with relative risk reductions of 31.2% and 31.5%, respectively (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The proportion of patients with confirmed disability progression was 27.3% with placebo, 21.7% with teriflunomide at 7 mg (P=0.08), and 20.2% with teriflunomide at 14 mg (P=0.03). Both teriflunomide doses were superior to placebo on a range of end points measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diarrhea, nausea, and hair thinning were more common with teriflunomide than with placebo. The incidence of elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (?1 times the upper limit of the normal range) was higher with teriflunomide at 7 mg and 14 mg (54.0% and 57.3%, respectively) than with placebo (35.9%); the incidence of levels that were at least 3 times the upper limit of the normal range was similar in the lower- and higher-dose teriflunomide groups and the placebo group (6.3%, 6.7%, and 6.7%, respectively). Serious infections were reported in 1.6%, 2.5%, and 2.2% of patients in the three groups, respectively. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Teriflunomide significantly reduced relapse rates, disability progression (at the higher dose), and MRI evidence of disease activity, as compared with placebo.

This study in adults evaluated safety of and compared efficacy of rasburicase alone with rasburicase followed by oral allopurinol and with allopurinol alone in controlling plasma uric acid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with hematologic malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were randomly assigned to rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg/d intravenously days 1-5), rasburicase plus allopurinol (rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg/d days 1 to 3 followed by oral allopurinol 300 mg/d days 3 to 5), or allopurinol (300 mg/d orally days 1 to 5). Primary efficacy variable was plasma uric acid response rate defined as percentage of patients achieving or maintaining plasma uric acid ? 7.5 mg/dL during days 3 to 7. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients received rasburicase, 92 rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 91 allopurinol. Plasma uric acid response rate was 87% with rasburicase, 78% with rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 66% with allopurinol. It was significantly greater for rasburicase than for allopurinol (P = .001) in the overall study population, in patients at high risk for TLS (89% v 68%; P = .012), and in those with baseline hyperuricemia (90% v 53%; P = .015). Time to plasma uric acid control in hyperuricemic patients was 4 hours for rasburicase, 4 hours for rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 27 hours for allopurinol. CONCLUSION: In adults with hyperuricemia or at high risk for TLS, rasburicase provided control of plasma uric acid more rapidly than allopurinol. Rasburicase was well tolerated as a single agent and in sequential combination with allopurinol.""",1
746,7048664,Evaluation of antithymocyte globulin for human bone marrow transplantation. Antihematopoietic and immunosuppressive activity,Antihematopoietic stem cell activity and immunosuppressive activity were evaluated before and after absorption of horse antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG) with mature granulocytes and fetal liver cells. Unabsorbed ATG was cytotoxic to committed myeloid-macrophage progenitors (CFU-C). Absorption of ATG removed cytotoxicity to CFU-C. The immunosuppressive potentials of absorbed ATGs were identical to those of unabsorbed ATG in several tests. Primary response to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified autologous and allogeneic cells could be suppressed by treatment with ATG alone whereas suppression of secondary and cytotoxic responses required treatment with ATG and complement. These data indicate that unsensitized or undifferentiated T cells may be more sensitive to ATG than are sensitized or differentiated T cells.,1
747,16762627,"Entecavir for treatment of lamivudine-refractory, HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lamivudine treatment is associated with frequent development of resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) and loss of treatment benefit. In preclinical and phase II studies, entecavir demonstrated potent antiviral activity against lamivudine-resistant HBV. METHODS: In this phase III, double-blind trial, hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients who were refractory to lamivudine therapy (persistent viremia or documented YMDD mutations while receiving lamivudine) were randomized to switch to entecavir 1 mg daily (n = 141) or continue lamivudine 100 mg daily (n = 145) for a minimum of 52 weeks. Two coprimary end points were assessed at 48 weeks: histologic improvement and a composite end point (HBV branched DNA <0.7 MEq/mL and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] <1.25 times the upper limit of normal). RESULTS: Histologic improvement occurred in 55% (68/124) of entecavir-treated vs 28% (32/116) of lamivudine-treated patients (P < .0001). More patients on entecavir than lamivudine achieved the composite end point: 55% (77/141) vs 4% (6/145), respectively (P < .0001). Mean change from baseline in HBV DNA was -5.11 log(10) copies/mL for entecavir-treated patients and -0.48 log(10) copies/mL for lamivudine-treated patients (P < .0001). Virologic rebound because of entecavir resistance substitutions occurred in 2 of 141 of entecavir-treated patients, and genotypic evidence of resistance was detected in 10 patients. The safety profile of entecavir was comparable to lamivudine with fewer ALT flares on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lamivudine-refractory chronic hepatitis B, switching to entecavir provides superior histologic improvement, viral load reduction, and ALT normalization compared with continuing lamivudine, with a comparable adverse event profile.",1
748,23907700,Once-daily simeprevir (TMC435) with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment-na?ve genotype 1 hepatitis C: the randomized PILLAR study,"""The phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled PILLAR trial investigated the efficacy and safety of two different simeprevir (SMV) doses administered once-daily (QD) with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-?-2a and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-na?ve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. Patients were randomized to one of five treatments: SMV (75 or 150 mg QD) for 12 or 24 weeks or placebo, plus Peg-IFN and RBV. Patients in the SMV arms stopped all treatment at week 24 if response-guided therapy (RGT) criteria were met; patients not meeting RGT continued with Peg-IFN and RBV until week 48, as did patients in the placebo control group. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates measured 24 weeks after the planned end of treatment (SVR24) were 74.7%-86.1% in the SMV groups versus 64.9% in the control group (P < 0.05 for all comparisons [SMV versus placebo], except SMV 75 mg for 24 weeks). Rapid virologic response (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL undetectable at week 4) was achieved by 68.0%-75.6% of SMV-treated and 5.2% of placebo control patients. According to RGT criteria, 79.2%-86.1% of SMV-treated patients completed treatment by week 24; 85.2%-95.6% of these subsequently achieved SVR24. The adverse event profile was generally similar across the SMV and placebo control groups, with the exception of mild reversible hyperbilirubinemia, without serum aminotransferase abnormalities, associated with higher doses of SMV. CONCLUSION: SMV QD in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV significantly improves SVR rates, compared with Peg-IFN and RBV alone, and allows the majority of patients to shorten their therapy duration to 24 weeks.""",1

To evaluate the efficacy of this drug in untreated patients with advanced NHL, we performed a prospective multicentre trial. Cladribine (0.12 mg/kg) was administered intravenously daily for 5 consecutive days in an out-patient setting. The treatment was repeated every 28 days for four cycles. Included were patients with a histological diagnosis of low grade NHL according to the Kiel classification and stage III or IV disease. Stage II patients were included when radiotherapy had failed. 55 patients were entered into the study. 50 patients were evaluable. The remission rate was 44/50 (88%; 95% confidence interval 82-100%), including complete remissions (CR) in 14 (28%) patients. Only 2 patients showed progression while on Cladribine treatment. The estimated overall survival, and time to treatment failure (TTF) were 85% and 51%, respectively, after a median observation time of 92 weeks. 11 (22%) patients showed grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to the WHO grading.

750,227234,Streptozotocin treatment of a pancreatic tumour producing VIP and gastrin associated with Verner-Morrison syndrome,A 57-year-old male patient with metastasizing non-beta islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas is described. Both gastrin and VIP levels were elevated and the patient suffered from a syndrome of pancreatic cholera and hyperacidity. The tumour contained gastrin and VIP as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. The patient also had a history of familial renal stone formation and parathyroid nodular hyperplasia. Resection of pancreatic tumour in 1973 resulted in four years without symptoms. In 1977 definite signs of multiple hepatic metastases appeared. These signs disappeared after streptozotocin given in a dosage of 2 g three times at weekly intervals. The patient had remained well for 20 months after this treatment. The causative agents for the clinical syndrome in this case are discussed in view of circulating hormone levels.,1
751,6224088,Abnormalities of B-cell activation and immunoregulation in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,"We studied B-lymphocyte function in 12 homosexual male patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 5 healthy homosexual men, and 12 heterosexual controls. In comparison with the heterosexual controls, the patients were found to have elevated numbers of cells spontaneously secreting immunoglobulin, decreased B-cell proliferative responses to T-cell-independent B-cell mitogens, and qualitatively deficient helper T cells. The hyperactive spontaneous B-cell responses as well as the refractoriness to signals for T-cell-independent B-cell activation were highly suggestive of an in vivo polyclonal activation of B cells and may have been responsible for the manifestations of B-cell hyperreactivity, such as hypergammaglobulinemia, seen in these patients. We conclude that the scope of immune dysfunction in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome involves B cells as well as T cells.",0
752,7815494,Modulation of the trans-suppression activity of hepatitis C virus core protein by phosphorylation,"We previously demonstrated that the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can suppress gene expression and replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a human hepatoma cell line (HuH-7). In this study, we have characterized the phosphorylation property of HCV core protein and examined the effect of phosphorylation on its suppressive activity of HBV. Our results indicated that both the full-length HCV core protein (22 kDa) and its processed or degraded forms (14 to 18 kDa) were phosphorylated in insect cells. As demonstrated by using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expression system and in vitro transcription and translation system, the phosphorylation of HCV core protein was carried out by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro. In both kinase reactions, it was determined that the phosphorylated amino acid was a serine residue. The potential phosphorylated sites in core protein were identified as residues Ser-53 and Ser-116 for PKA and Ser-53 and Ser-99 for PKC. Comparison of the phosphorylation intensities of the wild type and Ser mutants suggested that Ser-99 and Ser-116 were the major phosphorylation sites for PKC and PKA, respectively. The phosphorylation of Ser-99 and Ser-116, but not Ser-53, in HCV core protein was essential for the suppressive activity of HCV core protein on HBV gene expression and replication in HuH-7 cells. Mutation of the former two serine residues to alanine or aspartate residues led to a drastic loss of the inhibitory effects of HCV core protein on HBV gene expression (both transcription and antigen production) and pregenomic RNA encapsidation, as well as the release of HBV virus particles. In contrast, the Ser-53 mutant conferred the same level of suppressive activity as the wild type did. This property is in accordance with the observation that Ser-99 and Ser-116 are the predominant phosphorylation sites in the HCV core construct. All serine mutants (including those with mutations in PKA, PKC, and both kinase recognition sites) of HCV core protein retained the ability to translocate into the nucleus. Furthermore, wild-type HCV core protein diminished its suppressive activity when cells were treated with PKA or PKC inhibitor. In conclusion, HCV core protein is a phospho-protein and in HuH-7 cells, its trans suppression of HBV gene expression and replication is positively regulated by PKA and PKC. The role of phosphorylation in the control of trans-suppressive activity cannot be reproduced by introducing an acidic residue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0

756,22807038,PTEN-mediated Akt/?-catenin/Foxo1 signaling regulates innate immune responses in mouse liver ischemia/reperfusion injury,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) regulates innate immune responses inversely with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its direct downstream target gene, Akt. The Forkhead box O (Foxo) transcription factors are essential in the regulation of tissue development, immune homeostasis, and cell survival. This study was designed to investigate the role of PTEN-mediated Akt/?-catenin/Foxo1 signaling in the regulation of in vivo and in vitro innate immune responses in a mouse model of hepatic inflammatory injury induced by 90 minutes of liver partial warm ischemia followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. We found that knockdown of PTEN with small interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted Akt/?-catenin/Foxo1 signaling, leading to resistance against liver ischemia/reperfusion (IR) damage, local enhancement of antiapoptotic function, and downregulation of innate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. A specific PI3K blockade inhibited Akt/?-catenin signaling, increased Foxo1-mediated TLR4-driven local inflammation, and recreated cardinal features of liver IR injury. Moreover, knockdown of PTEN in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages enhanced ?-catenin activity, which in turn provided a negative regulatory feedback to the Foxo1 function, leading to the inhibition of TLR4 and NF-?B, with ultimate depression of proinflammatory cytokine programs in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our novel findings identify the PTEN-mediated Akt/?-catenin/Foxo1 axis as a key regulator of innate inflammatory response in the mouse liver. By identifying molecular mechanisms of PTEN-mediated Akt/?-catenin/Foxo1 signaling in TLR4 innate immune regulation, our study provides a rationale for therapeutic approaches to manage inflammation injury in IR-stressed liver.",0
757,26261103,ESR1 Mutations in Circulating Plasma Tumor DNA from Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients,"Mutations in the estrogen receptor (ER)α gene, ESR1, have been identified in breast cancer metastases after progression on endocrine therapies. Because of limitations of metastatic biopsies, the reported frequency of ESR1 mutations may be underestimated. Here, we show a high frequency of ESR1 mutations using circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) from patients with metastatic breast cancer. We retrospectively obtained plasma samples from eight patients with known ESR1 mutations and three patients with wild-type ESR1 identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of biopsied metastatic tissues. Three common ESR1 mutations were queried for using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In a prospective cohort, metastatic tissue and plasma were collected contemporaneously from eight ER-positive and four ER-negative patients. Tissue biopsies were sequenced by NGS, and ptDNA ESR1 mutations were analyzed by ddPCR. In the retrospective cohort, all corresponding mutations were detected in ptDNA, with two patients harboring additional ESR1 mutations not present in their metastatic tissues. In the prospective cohort, three ER-positive patients did not have adequate tissue for NGS, and no ESR1 mutations were identified in tissue biopsies from the other nine patients. In contrast, ddPCR detected seven ptDNA ESR1 mutations in 6 of 12 patients (50%). We show that ESR1 mutations can occur at a high frequency and suggest that blood can be used to identify additional mutations not found by sequencing of a single metastatic lesion. ",0
758,1317941,Correlation of expression of H/Le(y)/Le(b) antigens with survival in patients with carcinoma of the lung,"BACKGROUND: The level of expression of H/Le(y)/Le(b) antigens is high in various histologic types of lung cancer, a feature that may be related to deletion of A and B blood-group antigens. We evaluated the possibility that expression of this antigen, which can be defined by the monoclonal antibody MIA-15-5, might be of prognostic value, as suggested by our previous observation that MIA-15-5 inhibits tumor-cell motility and metastasis. METHODS: We used MIA-15-5 to stain tissue sections from 149 patients with primary lung cancer whose clinico-pathological histories were well documented. The survival curves for patients whose tumors stained positively were compared with the curves for those whose tumors stained negatively. Multivariate analyses were performed with a Cox proportional-hazards regression model. RESULTS: Among the 149 patients studied, five-year survival in the 91 patients with MIA-positive tumors was significantly lower than survival in the 58 with MIA-negative tumors (20.9 percent vs. 58.6 percent, P less than 0.001). Among the 67 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma, the rates also differed significantly (10.5 percent vs. 62.1 percent, P less than 0.001). The difference in survival between patients with MIA-positive tumors and those with MIA-negative tumors was significant among patients with blood groups A and AB (P less than 0.001), but not among those with blood group B or O (P = 0.071 and 0.068, respectively). Multivariate analysis with the Cox regression model indicated that positivity best correlated with five-year mortality, followed by lymph-node status (N stage) and tumor size status (T stage), whereas sex, age, and blood group did not correlate with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Positivity for MIA (i.e., immunohistologic staining by MIA-15-5, which defines H/Le(y)/Le(b) antigens) is inversely correlated with survival among patients with primary lung cancer and may be of prognostic value.",0
759,28935979,Intergrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses unveil nutrient remobilization events in leaf senescence of tobacco,"Leaf senescence in plants is a coordinated process that involves remobilization of nutrients from senescing leaves to sink tissues. The molecular events associated with nutrient remobilization are however not well understood. In this study the tobacco system with a source-sink relationship between different leaf positions was used in analyzing the spatiotemporal changes of 76 metabolites from leaves at 3 different stalk positions and 8 developmental stages. The metabolomic data was then compared with RNA-seq data from the same samples to analyze the activities of the metabolic pathways that are important for nutrient remobilization. Integrative analyses on metabolites accumulation and expression changes of enzyme-encoding genes in corresponding metabolic pathways indicated a significant up-regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and related metabolism of sugars, amino acids and fatty acids, suggesting the importance of energy metabolism during leaf senescence. Other changes of the metabolism during tobacco leaf senescence include increased activities of the GS/GOGAT cycle which is responsible for nitrogen recycling, and increased accumulation of nicotine. The results also suggested that a number of compounds seemed to be transported from senescing leaves at lower positions to sink leaves at upper positions. Some of these metabolites could play a role in nutrient remobilization. ",0
760,8133559,Short course chemotherapy for tuberculosis in children,"In order to determine the efficacy of short course chemotherapy (SCC) for tuberculosis in children, 83 newly diagnosed cases in children < 12 years old were given SCC and were prospectively followed for 1-3 years. Seventy-one cases were treated for 6-9 months as they had mild to moderate involvement. Twelve cases were treated for 12 months as they had meningitis (7), disseminated tuberculosis (2), or miliary tuberculosis (3). The results showed that none of the children, at the end of follow up, showed evidence of active tuberculosis. All children tolerated the drugs well, with side effects noticed being mild, namely transient hepatitis (4), vomiting (1), and skin rash (1). It is suggested that SCC for 6-9 months using isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin along with other drugs when necessary is highly effective in most cases of tuberculosis in children and has several advantages over conventional chemotherapy of 18 months or longer duration.",1

RESULTS: Exercise capacity was improved in the 41 patients treated with epoprostenol (median distance walked in six minutes, 362 m at 12 weeks vs. 315 m at base line), but it decreased in the 40 patients treated with conventional therapy alone (204 m at 12 weeks vs. 270 m at base line; P < 0.002 for the comparison of the treatment groups). Indexes of the quality of life were improved only in the epoprostenol group (P < 0.01). Hemodynamics improved at 12 weeks in the epoprostenol-treated patients. The changes in mean pulmonary-artery pressure for the epoprostenol and control groups were -8 percent and +3 percent, respectively (difference in mean change, -6.7 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence interval, -10.7 to -2.6 mm Hg; P < 0.002), and the mean changes in pulmonary vascular resistance for the epoprostenol and control groups were -21 percent and +9 percent, respectively (difference in mean change, -4.9 mm Hg/liter/min; 95 percent confidence interval, -7.6 to -2.3 mm Hg/liter/min; P < 0.001). Eight patients died during the study, all of whom had been randomly assigned to conventional therapy (P = 0.003). Serious complications included four episodes of catheter-related sepsis and one thrombotic event. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with conventional therapy, the continuous intravenous infusion of epoprostenol produced symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement, as well as improved survival in patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension.""",1

Until now, there have been few reports of this type of toxicity from MDMA, which may be related both to the potential of the drug to alter thermoregulation and to the circumstances of misuse. In addition, we have monitored 7 cases of hepatotoxicity and suspect that the frequency of this complication is increasing; a history of MDMA misuse should be sought in young people presenting with unexplained jaundice or hepatomegaly. We also describe 5 subjects involved in road traffic accidents in whom MDMA was identified. Misuse of MDMA can have severe acute toxic effects; few data are available concerning long-term morbidity, and this deserves close monitoring in future.""",1

764,1731512,"Anagrelide, a therapy for thrombocythemic states: experience in 577 patients. Anagrelide Study Group","PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of anagrelide when used to reduce platelet counts in patients with thrombocytosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred seventy-seven patients were treated with anagrelide to control the thrombocytosis of chronic myeloproliferative diseases. Three hundred thirty-five patients had primary thrombocythemia, 114 chronic granulocytic leukemia, 68 polycythemia vera, and 60 undifferentiated myeloproliferative diseases. Of the 577 patients, 504 were known to have been previously treated unsuccessfully with other modalities. RESULTS: Of the 577 patients treated, 424 were evaluable for response. Anagrelide in doses of 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg four times a day reduced the platelet count by 50%, or to less than 600,000/mm3, for at least 28 days in 396 of the 424 (93%) evaluable patients. Acquired resistance to the drug was not observed. Major side effects were neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac. In more than 5 years, 16% of patients discontinued treatment because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that anagrelide should become a useful agent in controlling the thrombocythemia seen in chronic myeloproliferative diseases and can be effective in patients in whom treatment with currently available agents has failed.",1
765,31907954,Applying Machine Learning in Liver Disease and Transplantation: A Comprehensive Review,"Machine learning (ML) utilizes artificial intelligence to generate predictive models efficiently and more effectively than conventional methods through detection of hidden patterns within large data sets. With this in mind, there are several areas within hepatology where these methods can be applied. In this review, we examine the literature pertaining to machine learning in hepatology and liver transplant medicine. We provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of ML tools and their potential applications to both clinical and molecular data in hepatology. ML has been applied to various types of data in liver disease research, including clinical, demographic, molecular, radiological, and pathological data. We anticipate that use of ML tools to generate predictive algorithms will change the face of clinical practice in hepatology and transplantation. This review will provide readers with the opportunity to learn about the ML tools available and potential applications to questions of interest in hepatology.",0

These studies were carried out in nine adult cats with acute implants. Of the 36 possible fascicles, 23 fascicles could be activated selectively with current stimuli applied to a single contact and ten of the remaining fascicles could be activated selectively with current stimuli applied to two contacts, """"field steering."""" In three experiments, time constraints precluded attempting selective activation through """"field steering"""" techniques. In eight of the ten cases where """"field steering"""" was used, a positive and a negative current source (anodic steering) were required to achieve the desired fascicle and in the remaining two cases, two negative current sources (cathodic steering) were required. The relative distance from the electrode contacts to each fascicle was well correlated to the order in which each fascicle was activated. In seven experiments, carried out in two animals, selective activation was verified by collision block techniques. The results of these experiments support the hypothesis that selective and independent activation of any of four motor fascicles in the cat sciatic nerve is possible using a four contact self-sizing spiral cuff electrode. Furthermore, in a more general case, these results support the concept of a """"tunable"""" electrode that is capable of """"steering"""" the excitation from an undesirable location to a preferred location.

767,23624776,Short and long access to cocaine self-administration activates tyrosine phosphatase STEP and attenuates GluN expression but differentially regulates GluA expression in the prefrontal cortex,"Dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) at the end of short access (ShA) cocaine self-administration is implicated in cocaine seeking. However, what receptors and phosphatases mediate this effect and whether ERK/CREB and related phospho-proteins in the dmPFC react similarly during early withdrawal from long access (LgA) cocaine self-administration are unknown. The effects of ShA vs. LgA cocaine self-administration on the phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), as well as GluN and GluA receptor subtype expression in the dmPFC during early withdrawal, were compared. Rats self-administered cocaine or received saline during 2- or 6-h daily sessions for 10-11 days. Two hours after the final session, the dmPFC was dissected out and processed for immunoblotting. Similar to previous findings after ShA cocaine, phospho-ERK and phospho-CREB in the dmPFC were decreased after LgA cocaine. Cocaine elevated phospho-PP2A (deactivation) and decreased phospho-STEP (activation) in both ShA and LgA cocaine rats. GluN1, GluN2B, and phospho-GluN2B Tyr1472 in the dmPFC were decreased after ShA and LgA cocaine. Further, a significant reduction of GluA2, GluA1, and phospho-GluA1 Ser845 was found only in LgA rats. Activation of phospho-STEP may underlie ERK and CREB dephosphorylation in the dmPFC as well as internalization and degradation of GluN complexes during early withdrawal from both ShA and LgA cocaine self-administration, whereas differential alteration of AMPA receptor subunits after ShA and LgA cocaine self-administration depends on cocaine intake.

768,23213086,Vitamin A deficiency is associated with hepatitis C virus chronic infection and with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy,"Recent data suggest that vitamin A modulates the expression of type I interferon receptor enhancing the antireplication effect of interferon-? on hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among patients with chronic HCV infection and to assess whether vitamin A deficiency could be associated with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy. The analysis included 199 consecutive treatment-na?ve chronic HCV patients in whom pretreatment serum vitamin A and 25-OH vitamin D were measured; 119 healthy blood donors were used as controls. Median (interquartile range) serum vitamin A in HCV-positive patients was significantly lower than in controls: 256 ng/mL (128-440) versus 742 (624-942, P<0.0001). Overall sustained viral response was achieved in 122/199 patients, 46/109 infected by difficult to treat HCV genotypes. In these latter, 39/104 (37.5%) were nonresponders. At multivariate analysis, nonresponse to antiviral therapy was predicted by carriage of interleukin (IL)-28B T/* genotypes, baseline serum levels of ?GT>60 IU/mL, of HCV RNA>600,000 IU/mL, of vitamin A?100 ng/mL, and a cumulative dose of ribavirin?80%. Seventeen patients (9.0%) had both serum levels of vitamin A?100 ng/mL and of vitamin D?20 ng/mL; the presence of a combined vitamin A and D deficiency was found to be a strong independent predictor of nonresponse to antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients with chronic HCV infection have serum vitamin A deficiency. This condition is associated with nonresponse to antiviral therapy.",0
769,11549783,History of quinolones and their side effects,"Fluoroquinolone development from 1985 to the present was reviewed. Severe drug adverse events were noted for enoxacin, pefloxacin and fleroxacin, which were phototoxic. Temafloxacin was associated with severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome, lomefloxacin caused phototoxicity and central nervous system (CNS) effects, and sparfloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and QTc prolongation. Tosufloxacin caused severe thrombocytopenia and nephritis, and hepatotoxicity was reported for trovafloxacin. Grepafloxacin was withdrawn due to cardiovascular effects, and clinafloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia. The structure of the quinolones directly relates to both their activity and side-effect profiles. The relationship among specific substituents attached to the quinolone nucleus are clarified. The incidence of specific adverse events associated with individual fluoroquinolones was reviewed in a five-year post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study in Japan, in which a total adverse drug reaction (ADR) rate of 1.3% was found for levofloxacin, compared to total ADR rates of 3.3% for pazufloxacin, 3.6% for tosufloxacin, 4.5% for gatifloxacin and 5.4% for balofloxacin. Gastrointestinal effects were the most common adverse events for all fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin had the lowest rate of CNS effects and skin adverse events among the agents listed.",1
770,22027579,"Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin antagonist, in the treatment of hyponatremia in cirrhosis","""BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tolvaptan is a vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist that improves serum sodium concentration by increasing renal solute-free water excretion. Specific data on the safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis and hyponatremia has not been exclusively evaluated. METHODS: This sub-analysis of the Study of Ascending Levels of Tolvaptan trials examined cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia who received 15 mg oral tolvaptan (n=63; increased to 30 or 60 mg if needed) or placebo (n=57) once-daily for 30 days. At baseline, 44% had mild hyponatremia (serum sodium 130-134 mmol/L), 56% had marked hyponatremia (serum sodium <130 mmol/L), 85% had cirrhosis due to alcohol and/or hepatitis B/C, and 80% were Child-Pugh class B/C. RESULTS: Tolvaptan was effective in raising serum sodium. Average daily area under the curve for serum sodium was significantly greater in the tolvaptan group from baseline to day 4 (p<0.0001) and day 30 (p<0.0001). This superiority was maintained after stratification by baseline hyponatremia (mild and marked), estimated glomerular filtration rate (</= 60 ml/min and >60 ml/min), or serum creatinine levels (<1.5mg/dl and >/= 1.5mg/dl). Hyponatremia recurred 7 days after discontinuation of tolvaptan. Mean mental component summary scores of the SF-12 health survey improved from baseline to day 30 in the tolvaptan group but not the placebo group (4.68 vs. 0.08, p=0.02). Major side effects due to tolvaptan were dry mouth and thirst. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 10% and 2% of patients in the tolvaptan and placebo group, respectively (p=0.11). Adverse event rates, withdrawals, and deaths were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: One month of tolvaptan therapy improved serum sodium levels and patient-reported health status in cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia. Hyponatremia recurred in tolvaptan-treated patients after discontinuation.""",1

772,8410125,Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of high-dose mitoxantrone in combination with cytarabine in patients with acute leukemia,"PURPOSE: To determine the maximally tolerated dose of mitoxantrone in combination with cytarabine in patients with acute leukemia and advanced phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and to assess the pharmacokinetics of high-dose mitoxantrone in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase I study, 68 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and accelerated- and blastic-phase CML received induction therapy consisting of cytarabine 3 g/m2 by infusion over 3 hours daily for 5 days, with escalating doses of mitoxantrone 40 to 80 mg/m2 over 1 to 2 days by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. Mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 15 patients given a single dose of mitoxantrone ranging from 40 to 80 mg/m2 in combination with cytarabine. RESULTS: Severe, but reversible hyperbilirubinemia (> three times normal) was considered the dose-limiting toxicity, and was observed in 25% of all patients and in 35% of those who received 70 to 80 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone. Other extramedullary toxicity, including cardiac dysfunction, was mild. Myelosuppression was universal and the median time to complete remission (CR) was 28 days (range, 19 to 77). The CR rate for previously untreated and relapsed patients with AML was 85% (17 of 20) and 38% (seven of 18), respectively. Eighty-three percent (15 of 18) of patients with ALL achieved a CR, including all patients with previously untreated disease. Eight of 12 patients with advanced-phase CML achieved a CR. No significant changes in mean mitoxantrone plasma elimination rates (ie, terminal plasma half-life and total-body clearance rate) occurred as the mitoxantrone dose doubled, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of mitoxantrone is 80 mg/m2 administered over 15 minutes as a single intravenous infusion in combination with cytarabine 3 g/m2/d for 5 days. At this dose, high concentrations of mitoxantrone are achievable in vivo to levels that have been shown to be extremely cytotoxic in vitro.",1

However, reports of drug-related side effects are increasing. The aim of our report is to review the frequency and timing of these complications within our transplant patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of liver-transplanted patients treated with sirolimus between November 1998 and April 2002. The data collected included SRL serum levels, frequency of reported and documented SRL-related side effects, and survival outcomes. Statistical evaluation included Pearson chi-square and the Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall, 205 patients were identified, with 30 patients removed from the analysis for different reasons. Of the remaining 175 patients, 91 (52%) patients developed a complication other than an increase in serum triglycerides and/or cholesterol. The most frequent complications were: bilateral lower extremity edema (57.1%), dermatitis (25.3%), oral ulcers (24.2%), joint pain (23.0%), pleural effusion (16.5%) and increase in abdominal girth (9.9%). Other complications included: generalized edema (5.5%), pericardial effusion (5.5%), facial edema (2.2%), and upper extremity edema (1.3%). In addition, we reported two cases of hepatic artery thrombosis, one case of wound dehiscence with evisceration that required surgical repair, and one case of skin cancer. Interestingly, we found that a previous history of myocardial ischemia correlates with the development of SRL side effects. CONCLUSIONS: SRL is a powerful immunosuppressant but not devoid of side effects. These results have elevated our level of suspicion when instituting SRL and may help with early recognition and prevention of drug related complications.",1
775,2950752,Hepatitis in patients receiving intraarterial chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma,"Fifty-one patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma confined to the liver received intraarterial chemotherapy through the hepatic artery via a subcutaneous pump. The chemotherapy consisted of sequential 14-day infusions of floxuridine (FUDR) and dichloromethotrexate (DCMTX) or a 14-day infusion of FUDR and bolus mitomycin (MMC). Twenty-four patients (47%) developed hepatitis with an elevation of hepatic serum transaminase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT, or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, SGPT). The median time to develop hepatitis was 11 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy. The morphologic effects of chemotherapy were evaluated in eight patients with hepatitis. All the patients with hepatitis had normalization of the serum transaminases after temporary cessation of chemotherapy. There was a trend toward a greater chance of remission in patients who developed hepatitis. Sixty-seven percent of the patients with a therapeutic response had hepatitis, whereas only 33% of the patients without a response had hepatitis. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The occurrence of hepatitis was not related to FUDR dose, drug program (FUDR-DCMTX vs. FUDR-MMC), pump flow rate, hepatic arterial anatomy, sex, or age of the patients.",1
776,25131509,Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in hepatic fibrosis,"Capillarization, lack of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) fenestration, and formation of an organized basement membrane not only precedes fibrosis, but is also permissive for hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis. Thus, dysregulation of the LSEC phenotype is a critical step in the fibrotic process. Both a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated, nitric oxide (NO)-independent pathway and a VEGF-stimulated NO-dependent pathway are necessary to maintain the differentiated LSEC phenotype. The NO-dependent pathway is impaired in capillarization and activation of this pathway downstream from NO restores LSEC differentiation in vivo. Restoration of LSEC differentiation in vivo promotes HSC quiescence, enhances regression of fibrosis, and prevents progression of cirrhosis.",0

778,27602507,Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension,"""BACKGROUND: The effect of decompressive craniectomy on clinical outcomes in patients with refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension remains unclear. METHODS: From 2004 through 2014, we randomly assigned 408 patients, 10 to 65 years of age, with traumatic brain injury and refractory elevated intracranial pressure (>25 mm Hg) to undergo decompressive craniectomy or receive ongoing medical care. The primary outcome was the rating on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) (an 8-point scale, ranging from death to """"upper good recovery"""" [no injury-related problems]) at 6 months. The primary-outcome measure was analyzed with an ordinal method based on the proportional-odds model. If the model was rejected, that would indicate a significant difference in the GOS-E distribution, and results would be reported descriptively. RESULTS: The GOS-E distribution differed between the two groups (P<0.001). The proportional-odds assumption was rejected, and therefore results are reported descriptively. At 6 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 26.9% among 201 patients in the surgical group versus 48.9% among 188 patients in the medical group; vegetative state, 8.5% versus 2.1%; lower severe disability (dependent on others for care), 21.9% versus 14.4%; upper severe disability (independent at home), 15.4% versus 8.0%; moderate disability, 23.4% versus 19.7%; and good recovery, 4.0% versus 6.9%. At 12 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 30.4% among 194 surgical patients versus 52.0% among 179 medical patients; vegetative state, 6.2% versus 1.7%; lower severe disability, 18.0% versus 14.0%; upper severe disability, 13.4% versus 3.9%; moderate disability, 22.2% versus 20.1%; and good recovery, 9.8% versus 8.4%. Surgical patients had fewer hours than medical patients with intracranial pressure above 25 mm Hg after randomization (median, 5.0 vs. 17.0 hours; P<0.001) but had a higher rate of adverse events (16.3% vs. 9.2%, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: At 6 months, decompressive craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension resulted in lower mortality and higher rates of vegetative state, lower severe disability, and upper severe disability than medical care. The rates of moderate disability and good recovery were similar in the two groups.

The hepatic lesion has mostly been described as necrosis or hepatitis. Tissue sections from 20 patients who had validated diphenylhydantoin hepatotoxicity were reviewed to define this entity. The morphologic lesions included ground-glass transformation of liver cells, hepatocellular degeneration and/or necrosis (with changes resembling those occurring in viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis), granulomatous reactions with or without associated hepatocellular injury or vasculitis, and infiltration by malignant cells of reticuloendothelial origin. The interval between the beginning of therapy and the adverse drug reaction varied from one to eight weeks. Clinically, 75% of the patients had fever, 62.5% had rash, and 89% had eosinophilla. Most patients recovered after the drug was discontinued.

782,21091041,Lapatinib for breast cancer: a review of the current literature,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The identification of HER-2 expression as a predictive and prognostic marker revolutionized breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a humanized mAb, improves survival in both early and advanced HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer. However, many cancers either do not respond or develop resistance to this agent. Lapatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has both HER-1 and -2 activities and has been licensed for use in recurrent breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2. Studies of lapatinib in early breast cancer are ongoing. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: A PubMed search was conducted using 'lapatinib' and 'breast cancer' as the key words. All published works up to July 2010 were reviewed. A manual review of abstracts presented at the ASCO Annual meeting and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was conducted for the last 2 years. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of lapatinib and pose questions which need to be addressed as we further expand our knowledge of the HER-2 subtypes of breast cancer. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the current literature as it pertains to the safety and efficacy of lapatinib in the treatment of breast cancer.

A randomized controlled study,"The per capita expenditure for health care of patients with multiple physical symptoms but no apparent physical disease (somatization disorder) is up to nine times the average per capita amount. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether psychiatric consultation would reduce the medical costs of these patients, without effecting a substantial change in patient outcome. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups and studied prospectively for 18 months. Treatment consisted of a psychiatric consultation and suggestions on management given to primary physicians. After nine months, the control group was crossed over to receive treatment with the same intervention. After the psychiatric consultation, the quarterly health care charges in the treatment group declined by 53 percent (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the charges in the control group showed wide variations but no overall change. The quarterly charges in the control group were significantly higher than those in the treatment group (P less than 0.05). After the control group was crossed over to receive treatment, their quarterly charges declined by 49 percent (P less than 0.05). The reductions in expenditures in both groups were due largely to decreases in hospitalization. We conclude that psychiatric consultation in the care of patients with somatization disorder reduced subsequent health care expenditures without inducing changes in health status or patients' satisfaction with their health care.",0
784,29196854,Fourteen years of progress testing in radiology residency training: experiences from The Netherlands,"To describe the development of the Dutch Radiology Progress Test (DRPT) for knowledge testing in radiology residency training in The Netherlands from its start in 2003 up to 2016. We reviewed all DRPTs conducted since 2003. We assessed key changes and events in the test throughout the years, as well as resident participation and dispensation for the DRPT, test reliability and discriminative power of test items. The DRPT has been conducted semi-annually since 2003, except for 2015 when one digital DRPT failed. Key changes in these years were improvements in test analysis and feedback, test digitalization (2013) and inclusion of test items on nuclear medicine (2016). From 2003 to 2016, resident dispensation rates increased (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.74, P-value <0.01) to maximally 16 %. Cronbach´s alpha for test reliability varied between 0.83 and 0.93. The percentage of DRPT test items with negative item-rest-correlations, indicating relatively poor discriminative power, varied between 4 % and 11 %. Progress testing has proven feasible and sustainable in Dutch radiology residency training, keeping up with innovations in the radiological profession. Test reliability and discriminative power of test items have remained fair over the years, while resident dispensation rates have increased. • Progress testing allows for monitoring knowledge development from novice to senior trainee. • In postgraduate medical training, progress testing is used infrequently. • Progress testing is feasible and sustainable in radiology residency training.

A retrospective cross sectional study was conducted between 1(st) February and 31(st) March 2007 at the Medical Outpatient Clinic of a 900-bed premier teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. 260 case notes of hypertensive patients, out of the 1178 case notes of patients who had been prescribed at least 250 mg of methyldopa for at least 2 months, were reviewed. 22.1% of the hypertensive patients were on methyldopa alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives for a mean period of 26.8+/-2.3 months (Range: 2-36 months). Overall, red cell count was prescribed and conducted in only 15.4% (40) of cohort. Only 4.2% (11) of patients had follow-up red cell count done after one month of methyldopa therapy; 9 out of these patients had marked reduction of red blood cells. Only 2.3% of cohort had baseline Liver Function Test (LFT) before start of methyldopa therapy and Alanine Transaminases and Aspartate transaminases levels were elevated in all patients. No patient had subsequent LFT prescribed and conducted particularly within 6-12 weeks of use of methyldopa. Direct Anti-Globulin Test was neither prescribed nor conducted in any of the cohort before and after commencement of methyldopa therapy. In conclusion, laboratory monitoring of ambulatory hypertensive patients on methyldopa therapy particularly for possible hematological and hepatic toxicities is less than optimal. The consequent therapeutic benefit of continuing considerable prescription and use of methyldopa in Nigeria is less likely to be realized without proper monitoring to preclude possible methyldopa-use related harms.""",1
786,24332721,An arthroscopic check valve release improves knee intrameniscal cyst symptoms in adolescent: a case report,"Intrameniscal cysts begin with the flow of synovial fluid from a meniscal tear in one direction, enlarging probably as a result of an on-and-off valve mechanism of the tear flap. The current available literature focuses primarily on the necessity for surgery, however a large meniscus resection to remove cysts may place an additional burden on menisci, leading ultimately to knee joint degenerative changes. In this article, we present a rare case of intrameniscal cysts with an isolated horizontal meniscal tear in an adolescent, and describe a new arthroscopic procedure for treating this type of intrameniscal cyst. We performed arthroscopic partial release of the meniscal tear check-valve mechanism, preventing further intrameniscal cyst expansion. The patient's clinical symptoms improved, and this procedure may also be useful in treating intrameniscal cysts with an isolated horizontal meniscal tear and can be considered as an option to preserve meniscal function and minimize degenerative arthritis in young athletes.

787,24792990,Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency--an under-recognized cause of dyslipidaemia and liver dysfunction,"Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deleterious mutations in the LIPA gene. The age at onset and rate of progression vary greatly and this may relate to the nature of the underlying mutations. Patients presenting in infancy have the most rapidly progressive disease, developing signs and symptoms in the first weeks of life and rarely surviving beyond 6 months of age. Children and adults typically present with some combination of dyslipidaemia, hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, and microvesicular hepatosteatosis on biopsy. Liver damage with progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure occurs in a large proportion of patients. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are common features, and cardiovascular disease may manifest as early as childhood. Given that these clinical manifestations are shared with other cardiovascular, liver and metabolic diseases, it is not surprising that LAL-D is under-recognized in clinical practice. This article provides practical guidance to lipidologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists and hepatologists on how to recognize individuals with this life-limiting disease. A diagnostic algorithm is proposed with a view to achieving definitive diagnosis using a recently developed blood test for lysosomal acid lipase. Finally, current management options are reviewed in light of the ongoing development of enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alfa (Synageva BioPharma Corp., Lexington, MA, USA), a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase enzyme.",1
788,9951955,Ibandronate,"Ibandronate (ibandronic acid) is a third generation bisphosphonate which inhibits hone resorption in human and animal studies. It also inhibits bone formation only at high doses (10 microg/kg/day) in animal studies. In animal models, ibandronate was more potent than etidronate, clodronate, pamidronate and alendronate and equivalent in potency or more potent than risedronate in inhibiting induced hypercalcaemia and bone resorption. In clinical studies, single-dose ibandronate (0.2 to 6 mg intravenously) significantly reduced albumin-corrected serum calcium levels and urinary markers of bone resorption in patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy, and in those with bone metastases. Serum calcium levels were normalised in 50 and 67% of ibandronate 2 mg recipients and in about 76% of 4 mg recipients. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or osteopenia. ibandronate (0.5 to 5 mg/day orally or 0.5 to 2 mg every 3 months intravenously) dose-dependently increased bone mineral density, with parallel reductions in the biochemical markers of bone turnover. In preliminary studies in patients with Paget's disease a single intravenous ibandronate dose (2mg) decreased serum alkaline phosphatase levels and urinary markers of bone turnover. Adverse events associated with the use of ibandronate in the management of hypercalcaemia of malignancy include increased body temperature, hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia. Less commonly, flu-like symptoms and gastrointestinal intolerance may occur.",1
789,15060457,Contribution of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to the management of patients with suspected common bile duct stones,"To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) as a systematic first-line investigation in the management of patients with suspected common bile duct stones. Ninety-nine consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of choledocolithiasis were prospectively explored by MRC. All MRCs were interpreted by two radiologists with knowledge of the patient's clinical condition and laboratory results. In case of discrepancy, a third opinion was obtained to reach consensus. The definitive diagnosis was established on the basis of endoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (n=40), clinical and biological follow-up at 6 Months (n=55) or other investigations (n=4). The clinician's level of confidence, management options implemented, and impact of management decisions were used to assess the contribution of MRC. The diagnostic accuracy of MRC for common bile duct stones was also determined. At the observed level of confidence (85.9%), MRC identified a differential diagnosis in 7.1% of patients avoiding unnecessary endoscopic exploration in 59.6%. Systematic first-line MRC enabled appropriate management in 83.8% of patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MRC for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones were 95.7%, 98.7%, 95.7% and 98.7%, respectively, with excellent inter-observer agreement (kappa=0.915). Magnetic resonance cholangiography can be used to efficiently screen patients who may need further invasive exploration of the common bile duct. It specifically identifies patients requiring therapeutic ERCP. ",0
790,15220491,CT of coronary artery disease,"The socioeconomic importance of heart disease provides considerable motivation for development of radiologic tools for noninvasive imaging of the coronary arteries. Current computed tomographic (CT) techniques combine high speed and spatial resolution with sophisticated electrocardiographic synchronization and robustness of use. Application of these modalities for evaluation of coronary artery disease is a topic of active current research. Coronary artery calcium measurements with different CT techniques have been used for determining the risk of coronary events, but the exact role of this marker for cardiac risk stratification remains unclear pending results of population-based studies. Contrast material-enhanced CT coronary angiography has become an established clinical indication for some scenarios (eg, coronary artery anomalies, bypass patency, surgical planning). With current technology, the accuracy of CT coronary angiography for detection of coronary artery stenoses appears promising enough to warrant pursuit of this application, but sensitivity is still not high enough for routine diagnostic needs. The high negative predictive value of a normal CT coronary angiogram, however, may be useful for reliable exclusion of coronary artery stenosis. The cross-sectional nature of CT may allow noninvasive assessment of the coronary artery wall. Use of contrast-enhanced CT coronary angiography for detection, characterization, and quantification of atherosclerotic changes and total disease burden in coronary arteries as a potential tool for cardiac risk stratification is currently being investigated.

791,25004202,Targeting breast tumors with pH (low) insertion peptides,"Extracellular acidity is associated with tumor progression. Elevated glycolysis and acidosis promote the appearance of aggressive malignant cells with enhanced multidrug resistance. Thus, targeting of tumor acidity can open new avenues in diagnosis and treatment of aggressive tumors and targeting metastatic cancers cells within a tumor. pH (low) insertion peptides (pHLIPs) belong to the class of pH-sensitive agents capable of delivering imaging and/or therapeutic agents to cancer cells within tumors. Here, we investigated targeting of highly metastatic 4T1 mammary tumors and spontaneous breast tumors in FVB/N-Tg (MMTV-PyMT)634Mul transgenic mice with three fluorescently labeled pHLIP variants including well-characterized WT-pHLIP and, recently introduced, Var3- and Var7-pHLIPs. The Var3- and Var7-pHLIPs constructs have faster blood clearance than the parent WT-pHLIP. All pHLIPs demonstrated excellent targeting of the above breast tumor models with tumor accumulation increasing over 4 h postinjection. Staining of nonmalignant stromal tissues in transgenic mice was minimal. The pHLIPs distribution in tumors showed colocalization with 2-deoxyglucose and the hypoxia marker, Pimonidazole. The highest degree of colocalization of fluorescent pHLIPs was shown to be with lactate dehydrogenase A, which is related to lactate production and acidification of tumors. In sum, the pHLIP-based targeting of breast cancer presents an opportunity to monitor metabolic changes, and to selectively deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to tumors.  ",0
792,2643774,Changes in the location of death after passage of Medicare's prospective payment system. A national study,"We reviewed age-specific national mortality data for the years 1981 through 1985 to evaluate changes in the location of death among the nation's elderly after implementation of Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS). Although it was unchanged in 1981 and 1982, the percentage of deaths occurring in the nation's nursing homes increased from 18.9 percent in 1982 to 21.5 percent in 1985. The increases in nursing home deaths were greatest between 1983 and 1984, when 33 states showed larger-than-expected increases when compared with a base period before implementation of PPS. These changes were accompanied by a decline in the percentage of deaths that occurred in hospitals. These changes in the location of death were most pronounced in the Midwest, South, and West; they were very small in the Northeast and in states not affected by the PPS. Furthermore, the states with high population enrollments in health maintenance organizations and with large declines in the mean hospital length of stay in 1984 showed the greatest shifts in the location of death. We conclude that Medicare's PPS resulted in the increased transfer of terminally ill patients from hospitals to nursing homes. Further study is required to determine whether such transfer is medically appropriate.",0

794,12622609,Role of liver function tests in detecting methotrexate-induced liver damage in sarcoidosis,"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate has become a standard second-line agent for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Because sarcoidosis has a high frequency of liver involvement, we routinely perform a liver biopsy after each cumulative gram of methotrexate therapy in patients with sarcoidosis in whom we plan to continue therapy. METHODS: Following a previously described protocol for methotrexate therapy, we have performed 100 liver biopsies on 68 patients with chronic sarcoidosis at our institution. On the basis of the liver biopsy results, we identified the following 4 groups: sarcoidosis (47 cases), toxic effects of methotrexate (14 cases), hepatitis C (2 cases), and normal liver tissue (37 cases). RESULTS: We found no difference among the groups in terms of age, weight at time of biopsy, the number of patients receiving corticosteroids at the time of biopsy, cumulative dose of methotrexate, race, or sex. The 14 cases of toxic reactions to methotrexate included 5 patients who had undergone 1 or more previous liver biopsies in which the results did not show toxic effects. We found a significant difference between groups for levels of alkaline phosphatase and asparate aminotransferase at the time of starting (or restarting) methotrexate therapy (analysis of variance, P<.05). This finding was also true for the liver function tests performed at the time of the biopsy (analysis of variance, P<.05). The highest values were for those whose biopsy findings showed sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Toxic reactions to methotrexate eventually occurred in more than 10% of patients with sarcoidosis treated for more than 2 years with methotrexate. Because of hepatic involvement owing to sarcoidosis, results of serial liver function tests were not useful in determining which patients would have this reaction to methotrexate.",1
795,23782157,Targeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma,"""BACKGROUND: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a mediator of the B-cell-receptor signaling pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell cancers. In a phase 1 study, ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, showed antitumor activity in several types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including mantle-cell lymphoma. METHODS: In this phase 2 study, we investigated oral ibrutinib, at a daily dose of 560 mg, in 111 patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients were enrolled into two groups: those who had previously received at least 2 cycles of bortezomib therapy and those who had received less than 2 complete cycles of bortezomib or had received no prior bortezomib therapy. The primary end point was the overall response rate. Secondary end points were duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS: The median age was 68 years, and 86% of patients had intermediate-risk or high-risk mantle-cell lymphoma according to clinical prognostic factors. Patients had received a median of three prior therapies. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Grade 3 or higher hematologic events were infrequent and included neutropenia (in 16% of patients), thrombocytopenia (in 11%), and anemia (in 10%). A response rate of 68% (75 patients) was observed, with a complete response rate of 21% and a partial response rate of 47%; prior treatment with bortezomib had no effect on the response rate. With an estimated median follow-up of 15.3 months, the estimated median response duration was 17.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8 to not reached), the estimated median progression-free survival was 13.9 months (95% CI, 7.0 to not reached), and the median overall survival was not reached. The estimated rate of overall survival was 58% at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib shows durable single-agent efficacy in relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.

796,20145262,"Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and metabolism of triethylenetetramine in healthy human participants: an open-label trial","The selective Cu(II)-chelator, triethylenetetramine (TETA), is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes. Recently, the authors showed that 2 acetylated metabolites, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT), are formed in humans following oral TETA administration. Thus, it became necessary to determine whether the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 phenotype has any effects on the pharmacological properties and safety profile of TETA. Twelve fast and 12 slow NAT2-phenotype healthy participants were recruited. After oral drug administration, the authors collected plasma and urine samples, measured plasma concentrations of TETA and its 2 metabolites along with concomitant urinary copper concentrations, and performed safety tests. They present, for the first time, the complete 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles of TETA, MAT, and DAT in humans. There was no evidence for clear-cut differences in pharmacokinetic profiles between fast and slow acetylators. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed no significant differences in cupruresis between the 2 NAT2 phenotypes. Safety results were consistent with TETA being well tolerated, and no significant differences in safety profiles were observed between the 2 phenotypes. Based on these data, NAT2 phenotype does not affect TETA's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or safety profiles. TETA may be acetylated via an alternative mechanism, such as that catalyzed by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltranferase.",1
797,11291233,Drug- and chemical-induced cholestasis,"Cholestasis resulting from drugs is an increasingly recognized cause of liver disease. It produces a broad clinical-pathologic spectrum of injury that includes simple jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis, and bile duct injury that can mimic extrahepatic biliary obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis, and sclerosing cholangitis. Although the risk of drug-induced cholestasis leading to a fatal outcome is quite rare, knowledge and recognition of the various forms of cholestatic injury assumes an importance whenever clinicians are confronted with jaundice or other manifestations of liver disease in patients receiving medicinal or chemical agents.",1

A nurse-led inter-professional team found lack of consistent oxygen weaning practices and lack of guidelines for nurses or RTs regarding pulse oximetry use with children admitted for acute respiratory illness. The team created and piloted evidence-based oxygen weaning and pulse oximetry protocols. After a 6 month pilot, children in the pilot had shorter length of stay, time on oxygen, and time on continuous pulse oximetry. Protocols improved patient outcomes and decreased associated charges.

799,1834940,The diagnostic performance of computer programs for the interpretation of electrocardiograms,"BACKGROUND: Computer programs for the interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) are now widely used. However, a systematic assessment of various computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs has not been performed. METHODS: We undertook a large international study to compare the performance of nine electrocardiographic computer programs with that of eight cardiologists in interpreting ECGs in 1220 clinically validated cases of various cardiac disorders. ECGs from the following groups were included in the sample: control patients (n = 382); patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 183), right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 55), or biventricular hypertrophy (n = 53); patients with anterior myocardial infarction (n = 170), inferior myocardial infarction (n = 273), or combined myocardial infarction (n = 73); and patients with combined infarction and hypertrophy (n = 31). The interpretations of the computer programs and the cardiologists were compared with the clinical diagnoses made independently of the ECGs, and the computer interpretations were compared with those of the cardiologists. RESULTS: The percentage of ECGs correctly classified by the computer programs (median, 91.3 percent) was lower than that of the cardiologists (median, 96.0 percent; P less than 0.01). The median sensitivity of the computer programs was also significantly lower than that of the cardiologists in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (56.6 percent vs. 63.9 percent, P less than 0.02), right ventricular hypertrophy (31.8 percent vs. 46.6 percent, P less than 0.01), anterior myocardial infarction (77.1 percent vs. 84.9 percent, P less than 0.001), and inferior myocardial infarction (58.8 percent vs. 71.7 percent, P less than 0.0001). The median total accuracy level (the percentage of correct classifications) was 6.6 percent lower for the computer programs (69.7 percent) than for the cardiologists (76.3 percent; P less than 0.001). However, the performance of the best programs nearly matched that of the most accurate cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that some but not all computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs perform almost as well as cardiologists in identifying seven major cardiac disorders.",0
800,32692457,Next-generation immunosequencing reveals pathological T cell architecture in autoimmune hepatitis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease that regularly relapses when immunosuppression is tapered. It is thought to be driven by T cells while the etiologic impact of an apparently deregulated B lineage system, as evidenced by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies, remains elusive. We set out to investigate T and B cell repertoires supporting chronic inflammation in AIH. APPROACH & RESULTS: T and B cell receptor (TCR/BCR) repertoire and HLA next-generation sequencing were used to record immune signatures from a cohort of 60 AIH patients and disease controls. Blood and liver B lineage immune metrics were not indicative of a dominant directional antigen selection apart from a slight skewing of IGHV-J genes. More importantly, we found strong AIH-specific TRBV-J skewing not attributable to the HLA-DRB1-specificities of the cohort. This TCR repertoire bias was generated as a result of peripheral T cell (de)selection and persisted in disease remission. Using a clustering algorithm according to antigenic specificity, we identified liver TCR clusters that were shared between patients with AIH but were absent or deselected in patients with other liver pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: AIH patients show profound and persisting T cell architectural changes that may explain high relapse rates after tapering immunosuppression. Liver T cell clusters shared between patients may mediate liver damage and warrant further study.",0
801,17709758,Nephropathic cystinosis in adults: natural history and effects of oral cysteamine therapy,"""BACKGROUND: The full burden of nephropathic cystinosis in adulthood and the effects of long-term oral cysteamine therapy on its nonrenal complications have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the severity of cystinosis in adults receiving and not receiving oral cysteamine therapy. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. PATIENTS: 100 persons (58 men and 42 women) age 18 to 45 years with nephropathic cystinosis examined between January 1985 and May 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Historical data were collected on renal transplantation, administration of oral cysteamine, and time and cause of death. Patients were evaluated for height and weight; thyroid, pulmonary, and swallowing function; muscle atrophy; hypogonadism (in men); retinopathy; vascular and cerebral calcifications; diabetes mellitus; and homozygosity for the common 57-kb deletion in CTNS. Laboratory studies were also performed. RESULTS: Of 100 adults with nephropathic cystinosis, 92 had received a renal allograft and 33 had died. At least half of the patients had hypothyroidism, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (in men), pulmonary insufficiency, swallowing abnormalities, or myopathy. One third of the patients had retinopathy or vascular calcifications, and 24% had diabetes. Homozygosity for the 57-kb CTNS deletion was associated with an increased risk for death and morbidity. The 39 patients who received long-term (> or =8 years) oral cysteamine therapy were taller and heavier, had a renal allograft later in life, had lower cholesterol levels, and experienced fewer complications and deaths than patients who received cysteamine for fewer than 8 years. The frequency of diabetes mellitus, myopathy, pulmonary dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and death increased as time off cysteamine treatment increased, and it decreased as time on cysteamine therapy increased. LIMITATIONS: The study was retrospective and not randomized. The criteria used to measure adequacy of treatment were arbitrary. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated nephropathic cystinosis causes extensive morbidity and death in adulthood. Long-term oral cysteamine therapy mitigates these effects.""",1

Two hundred microliters plasma samples were extracted by dichloromethane under a strong basic condition. The analytes were separated by a C18 column and detected with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The used mobile phase was acetonitrile-water (40:60, v/v) containing 5mM ammonium acetate and 0.2% glacial acetic acid. Detection was carried out by positive electrospray ionization in selected ion reaction (SIR) mode at m/z 356.6 for tetrahydropalmatine, 354.6 for protopine, 352.6 for palmatine and 180.4 for the IS, respectively. The method was validated over the concentration range of 1.00-500ngmL(-1) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.00ngmL(-1) for all three analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision values were less than 9% relative standard deviation (R.S.D.), and the relative error ranged from -7.4 to 4.8%. The extraction recoveries were on average 91.42% for tetrahydropalmatine, 84.75% for protopine, 57.26% for palmatine, and 83.18% for IS.

803,18330753,Homocysteine levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome],"The exact mechanism of development of cardiovascular disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) remains to be unknown. The role of homocysteine in atherosclerotic disease process has become well established over the past ten years. Our aim was to study to compare homoscysteine levels between OSAS and control levels. Sixty-two subjects with OSAS and twelve similar controls in age, gender, body mass index, smoking and coronary heart disease were included in this prospective study. Serum levels of homocysteine (13.5 +/- 6.0 micromol/L vs. 10.2 +/- 2.9 micromol/L, p= 0.03) in the OSAS group were significantly greater than those in the control group. Logistic regression analyses showed that OSAS (Odds ratio: 9.08 95% CI 2.347-35.120; p= 0.001) was independent risk factors for high levels of serum homocysteine in age, smoking status, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. We conclude that homocysteine may be an important factor for development of cardiovascular disease in patients with OSAS. ",0

The accuracy coefficient, a measure of probabilistic accuracy based on probability assigned to outcomes that occur, was used to assess the skill of clinical rheumatologists in predicting patient outcomes. Physicians' scores correlated well with degree of clinical experience. An approach to evaluation based on the measure provides a sensitive assessment of marginal benefit of technologies such as laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures or computer consultations. Most currently used methods of computer prediction were not as accurate as the best physicians tested. By allowing measurement of ability to individualize predictions to each patient's unique characteristics, the accuracy-coefficient approach has potential use in physician assessment.",0

809,10517569,Acute zolpidem overdose--report of two cases,"""This report describes two cases of acute zolpidem overdose. The decedent in the first case was a 36-year-old female found dead in bed in her secured home. She had a history of psychiatric illness, including paranoid disorder, depression with panic episodes, and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was treated with risperidone and sertraline. Nine months prior to her death, the decedent was also prescribed zolpidem (Ambien). The postmortem examination revealed white foam within the larynx and upper trachea, which is indicative of pulmonary edema. Toxicological analyses of the urine showed the presence of caffeine, risperidone, and zolpidem. Subsequent quantitation of postmortem iliac serum revealed 5.6 microg/L of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the following zolpidem concentrations: blood (subclavian), 4.5 mg/L; blood (iliac), 7.7 mg/L; vitreous humor, 1.6 mg/L; bile, 8.9 mg/L; urine, 1.2 mg/L; liver, 22.6 mg/kg; and gastric contents, 42 mg. The second case involved a 58-year old female, also found dead in bed, with white foam around her mouth. The decedent had a 25-year history of hypertension and mental illness--manic depression and schizophrenia. She was medicated with carbamazepine, naproxen, risperidone, and zolpidem. The postmortem examination revealed cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, hepatomegaly, mild coronary atherosclerosis, and no signs of trauma. Toxicological analyses of the urine showed the presence of zolpidem and carbamazepine and metabolite. Zolpidem concentrations were as follows: blood (iliac), 1.6 mg/L; vitreous humor, 0.52 mg/L; bile, 2.6 mg/L; liver, 12 mg/kg; and gastric contents, 0.9 mg. The zolpidem blood concentrations of these cases are consistent with those of the previously published fatalities. The blood/vitreous humor ratios of zolpidem were 2.81 (subclavian) and 4.81 (iliac) in the first case and 3.08 (iliac) in the second case. These ratios, along with the sampling times of blood and vitreous humor for both cases, are not conclusive to indicate a definitive presence or absence of postmortem drug redistribution of zolpidem. The cause of death for both cases was determined to be acute zolpidem overdose, and manner of death was suicide.""",1
810,1134519,Trends in survival rates of patients with cancer,"Reports on survival of patients with cancer issued by the National Cancer Institute indicate marked improvement for almost all forms of cancer from the 1940's to 1950's. Subsequently, prognosis for patients with forms of cancer accounting for approximately 42 per cent of all cancers continued to improve, although at a slower rate. For cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, stomach and pancreas, little improvement in patient survival during the 1960's was observed, and for women with invasive cervical cancer, survival rates decreased slightly. One-year survival results for patients with diagnoses made during 1970-71 suggest that improvement in five-year survival observed during the 1960's for many forms of cancer will be sustained. Continued reporting of survival of patients treated in the 1970's would ultimately demonstrate the degree of effectiveness of recently introduced therapeutic procedures.",0

The WHO Collaborative Study of Neoplasia and Steroid Contraceptives,"Data from a hospital-based case-control study conducted in four developing countries were analyzed to evaluate the role of reproductive factors in the etiology of liver cancer. Eighty-three patients newly diagnosed with primary liver cancer and 596 matched controls between the ages of 15 and 56 years completed study interviews. The relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was elevated significantly in women of high gravidity, an association that was attributable to the effects of full-term pregnancies. The adjusted relative-risk estimate in women who had ever had a full-term pregnancy was 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.6-4.1), and risk increased directly with the number of full-term pregnancies (P for trend = 0.03), rising to 3.8 among women with seven or more births compared to women with one to two births. Induced abortions and a history of miscarriage were unrelated to risk. These findings were unchanged after adjustment for a history of jaundice, lifetime number of sexual partners, or age at first sexual intercourse--variables which may be related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure.

Among 199 patients with node-negative disease, but not among 198 with node-positive disease, high levels of cathepsin D proved to be a significant predictor of reduced disease-free survival (median follow-up, 64 months), either as a continuous variable (log cathepsin D; P = 0.018) or as a dichotomous variable with an optimized cutoff point (P = 0.0001). Results were similar for overall survival (P = 0.009 and 0.0001, respectively). Relating the level of cathepsin D to other prognostic factors in the patients with node-negative disease, we found an association with aneuploidy but none with estrogen or progesterone receptors, tumor size, or the age of the patient. In multivariate analyses, a high level of cathepsin D was the most important independent factor in predicting shorter disease-free and overall survival in patients with node-negative disease. As compared with the risk in women with low levels of cathepsin D, the relative risk of tumor recurrence was 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.4) and the relative risk of death was 3.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 7.3) among those with high levels of cathepsin D. For disease-free survival, cathepsin D status was predictive of outcome primarily among those with aneuploid tumors; the actuarial five-year recurrence rates of aneuploid tumors were 60 percent among women with high levels of cathepsin D and 29 percent among those with low levels, as compared with 22 percent for all diploid tumors. We conclude that cathepsin D may be an independent predictor of early recurrence and death in node-negative breast cancer.",0
815,22919063,"The mitochondrial Atp8 mutation induces mitochondrial ROS generation, secretory dysfunction, and β-cell mass adaptation in conplastic B6-mtFVB mice","Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause a variety of pathologic phenotypes. In this study, we used conplastic mouse strains to characterize the impact of a mtDNA mutation in the Atp8 gene on β-cell function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, β-cell mass, and glucose metabolism in response to high-fat diet (HFD). In comparison with B6-mt(AKR) controls, the B6-mt(FVB) strain carries a point mutation of the mtDNA-coded Atp8 gene (ATP synthase), leading to a fragmentated mitochondrial phenotype. Isolated pancreatic islets from 3-month-old B6-mt(FVB) mice showed increased mitochondrial generation of ROS, reduced cellular ATP levels, reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion, higher susceptibility to palmitate stress, and pathological morphology of mitochondria. ROS generation in β-cells was not affected by changes of the ambient glucose concentrations. Feeding a HFD for 3 months resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in B6-mt(FVB) mice but not in B6-mt(AKR) controls. In B6-mt(FVB) animals, glucose intolerance positively correlated with gain of body weight. Serum insulin levels and β-cell mass significantly increased in B6-mt(FVB) mice after a 3-month HFD. The data indicate that the mutation in the Atp8 gene induces mitochondrial dysfunction in β-cells with concomitant impairment of secretory responsiveness. This mitochondrial dysfunction induced a higher susceptibility to metabolic stressors, although this effect appeared not strictly linked to nutrient-induced ROS generation. The Atp8 gene mutation caused mitochondrial dysfunction, apparently stimulating an adaptive increase of β-cell mass in response to HFD, whereas mitochondrial ROS might have had an supportive role.

816,24336344,Unbiased estimation of chloroplast number in mesophyll cells: advantage of a genuine three-dimensional approach,"Chloroplast number per cell is a frequently examined quantitative anatomical parameter, often estimated by counting chloroplast profiles in two-dimensional (2D) sections of mesophyll cells. However, a mesophyll cell is a three-dimensional (3D) structure and this has to be taken into account when quantifying its internal structure. We compared 2D and 3D approaches to chloroplast counting from different points of view: (i) in practical measurements of mesophyll cells of Norway spruce needles, (ii) in a 3D model of a mesophyll cell with chloroplasts, and (iii) using a theoretical analysis. We applied, for the first time, the stereological method of an optical disector based on counting chloroplasts in stacks of spruce needle optical cross-sections acquired by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. This estimate was compared with counting chloroplast profiles in 2D sections from the same stacks of sections. Comparing practical measurements of mesophyll cells, calculations performed in a 3D model of a cell with chloroplasts as well as a theoretical analysis showed that the 2D approach yielded biased results, while the underestimation could be up to 10-fold. We proved that the frequently used method for counting chloroplasts in a mesophyll cell by counting their profiles in 2D sections did not give correct results. We concluded that the present disector method can be efficiently used for unbiased estimation of chloroplast number per mesophyll cell. This should be the method of choice, especially in coniferous needles and leaves with mesophyll cells with lignified cell walls where maceration methods are difficult or impossible to use.  ",0

To confirm this finding, we conducted a multicenter study of the method as used by 11 surgeons in a variety of practice settings. METHODS: We enrolled 443 patients with breast cancer. The technique involved the injection of 4 ml of technetium-99m sulfur colloid (1 mCi [37 MBq]) into the breast around the tumor or biopsy cavity. """"Hot spots"""" representing underlying sentinel nodes were identified with a gamma probe. Sentinel nodes subjacent to hot spots were removed. All patients underwent a complete axillary lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: The overall rate of identification of hot spots was 93 percent (in 413 of 443 patients). The pathological status of the sentinel nodes was compared with that of the remaining axillary nodes. The accuracy of the sentinel nodes with respect to the positive or negative status of the axillary nodes was 97 percent (392 of 405); the specificity of the method was 100 percent, the positive predictive value was 100 percent, the negative predictive value was 96 percent (291 of 304), and the sensitivity was 89 percent (101 of 114). The sentinel nodes were outside the axilla in 8 percent of cases and outside of level 1 nodes in 11 percent of cases. Three percent of positive sentinel nodes were in nonaxillary locations. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy of sentinel nodes can predict the presence or absence of axillary-node metastases in patients with breast cancer. However, the procedure can be technically challenging, and the success rate varies according to the surgeon and the characteristics of the patient.""",0

Patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) benefit from ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment. Since there is still certain reluctance to use UDCA in pregnant women, mainly due to warnings in the official SPC information in respective drug leaflets, our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of UDCA during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our retrospective multicentric study was performed on 191 consecutive pregnant women with ICP treated with UDCA. Any maternal and/or fetal complications of the UDCA treatment were searched for; healthy pregnant women (n = 256) served as controls. RESULTS: The UDCA treatment improved liver disease status in the majority of the affected women (86.1%). This treatment was well tolerated, with only negligible skin reactions (0.5%) and mild diarrhea (4.7%). No complications attributable to UDCA treatment were detected during the fetal life, delivery, or the early neonatal period. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the good efficacy and safety of UDCA treatment in pregnancy for both mothers and fetuses/neonates.""",1
822,24438369,Allopurinol enhanced thiopurine treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: safety considerations and guidelines for use,"The thiopurine medications are standard inflammatory bowel disease treatments. Therapeutic failure is observed, however, often because of variable drug metabolism. Allopurinol can enhance the potency of thiopurine treatment. Our objective is to review the relevant literature, and our own experience, to determine if allopurinol enhancement of thiopurine treatment is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. Published reports of, and our own experience using, allopurinol-thiopurine combination therapy indicate that the addition of allopurinol will enhance thiopurine treatment in up to 60% of patients. There are risks to this approach, but with appropriate monitoring, these risks should approximate those observed with thiopurine therapy alone. Combination therapy with allopurinol and a thiopurine is a reasonable alternative for inflammatory bowel disease patients not responding to thiopurine monotherapy. Physicians experienced in thiopurine treatment, who have familiarity with thiopurine metabolism, and are willing to engage in appropriate therapeutic monitoring, should consider this strategy. ",0

The inhibitor resembles a substance previously described in synovial fluids and is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 as determined by gel filtration. In contrast, levels of inhibitory activity in peritoneal fluids from five patients with familial Mediterranean fever were decreased to less than 10 per cent of those found in normal subjects. Gel filtration of peritoneal and synovial fluids from these patients did not yield any fraction with inhibitory activity. We suggest that C5a-inhibitor deficiency in joint and peritoneal fluids from patients with familial Mediterranean fever may have a role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory attacks characteristic of this disease.",0
825,1001025,Action of rotenone and related respiratory inhibitors on mammalian cell division. 2 Ultrastructural studies,"Light and electron microscopic examination of cultured mammalian cells treated with the respiratory inhibitor rotenone revealed that chromosome, spindle, and centriole configurations were virtually identical to that of mitotic cells arrested with Colcemid, a microtubule assembly inhibitor. The chromosomes of cells arrested in mitosis with either drug were grouped in a spherical mass near the cell centre and centrioles failed to opposite mitotic poles. Spindle microtubules were observed in limited numbers near some chromosome kinetochores and the centrioles. The outer portions of the cell cytoplasm were devoid of microtubules. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that cells did not progress beyond early stages of mitosis in the presence of rotenone or Colcemid. The ultrastructure of cells harvested from cultures grown in amytal was similar to that of untreated cells. These observations suggest that rotenone arrests mitosis in mammalian cells by inhibition of spindle microtubule assembly. ",0
826,28932047,A relationship between salivary flow rates and Candida counts in patients with xerostomia,"Most of the adult population is colonized by Candida in their oral cavity. The process of colonization depends on several factors, including the interaction between Candida and salivary proteins. Therefore, salivary gland hypofunction may alter the oral microbiota and increase the risk for opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the relationship between salivary flow rates (SFRs) and Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. This study aims to determine and evaluate the relationship between SFRs and Candida colony forming units (CFUs) in patients with xerostomia. This study was a descriptive study. The study participants were taken from the patients attending outpatient department in a private dental college. Fifty patients, who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire of the symptoms of xerostomia, were selected. Chewing stimulated whole saliva samples were collected from them and their SFRs were assessed. Saliva samples were inoculated in the Sabouraud dextrose agar culture media for 24-48 h, and Candida CFUs were counted. Chi-squared test was used to analyze the data. There was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and candida CFUs count when patients with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). Females had less SFR than males. Most of the patients who had hyposalivation were taking medication for the underlying systemic diseases.  There was a significantly negative correlation between SFRs and Candida CFUs in the patients with xerostomia. ",0

Three risk groups begin to emerge: a) Young teenage cannabis users who lose some of their capacity to learn complex functions and who flee from reality to a world of dreams. With its sedative effect, cannabis could modify such emotions as anger and anxiety and slow down the liberation process of adolescence. b) Heavy daily users, often persons who cannot cope with depression or their life circumstances. c) Psychiatric patients whose resistance to relapses into psychotic reactions might be diminished according to the psychotropic effects of cannabis.

Retrospective chart review of all consecutive women treated with primary medical management for EPF at our institution from 2006 to 2012. 168 patients were included in the present study. The overall success rate, defined as the absence of the need for surgical intervention, was 61 % and did not differ by calendar year. There was no difference in success rate grouped by diagnosis [intrauterine embryonic/fetal demise (IUED/IUFD) vs. anembryonic gestation; p = 0.30] or gestational age (<9 or ≥9 weeks; p = 0.48). The success rate varied significantly according to the required dose of misoprostol, ≤800 or >800 μg (68 vs. 50 %, p = 0.029). Of the possible predictive factors of success, only the dose of misoprostol required was a significant independent negative predictor. Mean and median time to tissue expulsion after the first dose of misoprostol were 8.4 and 5.5 h, respectively. The incidence of side effects was low with no blood transfusions required. The success rate in this study is markedly below published data. This can possibly be attributed to retrospective study design, allowing for physician subjectivity and patients' wishes in the absence of strict study requirements. The protocol was well tolerated with a paucity of side effects. We make suggestions for enhancing success rates in the clinical setting by optimizing medication protocols, establishing precise treatment guidelines and training physicians in the accurate interpretation of treatment outcomes.

829,20616953,An update on the safety and efficacy of decitabine in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal bone marrow malignancies characterized by peripheral cytopenias and dysplastic changes in the bone marrow with various clinical features. Patients with MDS, in particular those with intermediate-2 (Int-2) and high-risk disease, have a poor prognosis. The mainstay of treatment includes cytoxic chemotherapy and supportive care. Over the last decade, promising results from studies focusing on hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine (5-aza-deoxycytidine) and 5-azacitidine, have led to the expansion of the therapeutic arsenal for MDS. This review presents the current data available on the clinical efficacy and safety profile for decitabine as a treatment for MDS. Although not fully understood, decitabine's antitumor activity may involve its ability to induce hypomethylation and reactivation of genes responsible for cellular differentiation, stimulate an immune response, induce DNA damage/apoptotic response pathways, and/or augment stem cell renewal. Future studies that use epigenetic therapies that combine hypomethylating agents with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and head-to-head comparison studies of decitabine and 5-azacitidine will provide valuable pre-clinical and clinical data, enhancing our understanding of these drugs.",1

832,6384002,"Anatomy, visualization and sampling of the biliary tree in animals and man","Difficulties in obtaining proper bile samples are due to inaccessibility of the biliary tree and to distortions induced by sampling methods.

Experimental methods which interrupt the enterohepatic circulation or alter the intestinal migrating myoelectric complex induce spurious changes in bile flow and composition. Biliary tract pressure-flow relationships must be maintained or the gallbladder will be made functionless. Dead space errors lead to distortions unless studies are performed in the steady state, or dead space is measured and corrections are applied. Surgery has major effects on some parameters of interest, and animals should be allowed to recover when these are studied. The effect of the mixing of bile with other secretions in the duodenum must be considered when using bile-rich duodenal fluid. For some parameters of bile secretion, mixing is unimportant but for others, special precautions for handling bile and interpreting results are required.",0
833,3722044,Safety of ticarcillin disodium/potassium clavulanate,"Clavulanate potentiated ticarcillin contains two components with an established safety record. Ticarcillin used clinically alone and with clavulanate, a component of clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, given orally or intravenously. No pharmacokinetic interaction occurs between the two components when given together in man or animals in which metabolism is qualitatively similar to man. Safety evaluation studies carried out in the animals established as suitable for studying the toxicology of ticarcillin have shown no unexpected synergistic or antagonistic toxic effects of Timentin not predicted from the toxicological evaluation of clavulanate alone. Reproductive mutagenic, cardiovascular and general pharmacological studies have shown no significant hazard from Timentin. Clinical experience with ticarcillin has been reviewed, and impairment of platelet function, seen at supratherapeutic doses, has been shown in an animal model not to be influenced by clavulanate. The assessment of the safety of ticarcillin and clavulanate for therapeutic use in man is thus comprised of the clinical experience with ticarcillin and parenteral clavulanate in clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, animal safety evaluation studies, and the clinical experience with Timentin reported in this symposium.",1

Alterations in these pharmacokinetic principles have been rarely reported. We report here three cases of an unusual double hump, or Bactrian, pattern of [APAP]. We review the literature to describe the case characteristics of these rare cases. A 38-year-old woman ingested 2 g hydrocodone/65 g acetaminophen. Her [APAP] peaked at 289 mcg/mL (8 h), decreased to 167 mcg/mL (31 h), then increased to 240 mcg/mL (39 h). She developed liver injury (peak AST 1603 IU/L; INR1.6). A 25-year-old man ingested 2 g diphenhydramine/26 g APAP. His [APAP] peaked at 211 mcg/mL (15 h), decreased to 185 mcg/mL (20 h), and increased again to 313 mcg/mL (37 h). He developed liver injury (peak AST 1153; INR 2.1). A 16-year-old boy ingested 5 g diphenhydramine and 100 g APAP. His [APAP] peaked at 470 mcg/mL (25 h), decreased to 313 mcg/mL (36 h), then increased to 354 mcg/mL (42 h). He developed liver injury (peak AST 8,686 IU/L; peak INR 5.9). We report three cases of Bactrian (""""double hump"""") pharmacokinetics after massive APAP overdoses. Cases with double hump pharmacokinetics may be associated with large ingestions (26-100 g APAP) and are often coingested with antimuscarinics or opioids. Several factors may contribute to these altered kinetics including the insolubility of acetaminophen, APAP-induced delays in gastric emptying, opioid or antimuscarinic effects, or enterohepatic circulation. Patients with double hump APAP concentrations may be at risk for liver injury, with AST elevations and peaks occurring later than what is typical for acute APAP overdoses.""",1
835,23703590,"The small molecule, genistein, increases hepcidin expression in human hepatocytes","Hepcidin, a peptide hormone that decreases intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release, is a potential drug target for patients with iron overload syndromes because its levels are inappropriately low in these individuals. Endogenous stimulants of Hepcidin transcription include bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by effects on mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)4 or signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3, respectively. We conducted a small-scale chemical screen in zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules that modulate hepcidin expression. We found that treatment with the isoflavone, genistein, from 28-52 hours postfertilization in zebrafish embryos enhanced Hepcidin transcript levels, as assessed by whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genistein's stimulatory effect was conserved in human hepatocytes: Genistein treatment of HepG2 cells increased both Hepcidin transcript levels and promoter activity. We found that genistein's effect on Hepcidin expression did not depend on estrogen receptor signaling or increased cellular iron uptake, but was impaired by mutation of either BMP response elements or the Stat3-binding site in the Hepcidin promoter. RNA sequencing of transcripts from genistein-treated hepatocytes indicated that genistein up-regulated 68% of the transcripts that were up-regulated by BMP6; however, genistein raised levels of several transcripts involved in Stat3 signaling that were not up-regulated by BMP6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ELISA experiments revealed that genistein enhanced Stat3 binding to the Hepcidin promoter and increased phosphorylation of Stat3 in HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: Genistein is the first small-molecule experimental drug that stimulates Hepcidin expression in vivo and in vitro. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of identifying and characterizing small molecules that increase Hepcidin expression. Genistein and other candidate molecules may subsequently be developed into new therapies for iron overload syndromes.",0
836,1881416,Correlations between antepartum maternal metabolism and intelligence of offspring,"BACKGROUND: It is not clear to what extent maternal metabolism during pregnancy affects the cognitive and behavioral function of the offspring by altering brain development in utero. To investigate this question, we correlated measures of metabolism in pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic women with the intellectual development of their offspring. METHODS: The study included 223 pregnant women and their singleton offspring: 89 women had diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes mellitus), 99 had the onset of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus), and 35 had normal carbohydrate metabolism during their pregnancy. We correlated measures of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, episodes of hypoglycemia, episodes of acetonuria, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels) with two measures of intellectual development in the offspring--the mental development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, given at the age of two years, and the Stanford--Binet Intelligence Scale, given at the ages of three, four, and five years and expressed as an average of the three scores. RESULTS: After correction for socioeconomic status, race or ethnic origin, and patient group, the children's mental-development-index scores at the age of two years correlated inversely with the mothers' third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (r = -0.21, P less than 0.01); the average Stanford-Binet scores correlated inversely with third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = -0.20, P less than 0.02) and free fatty acid (r = -0.27, P less than 0.002) levels. No other correlations were significant. Including various perinatal events (e.g., prematurity and acidemia) in the analyses did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may affect behavioral and intellectual development in the offspring. The associations between gestational ketonemia in the mother and a lower IQ in the child warrant continued efforts to avoid ketoacidosis and accelerated starvation in all pregnant women.",0

Our preliminary RNA-seq data suggested its downregulated expression pattern in diabetic retinopathy (DR). We therefore further investigated the function of AK077216 in DR. Plasma samples used in this study were derived from blood, which was extracted from 60 diabetic retinopathy patients. AK077216 in plasma of DR patients, diabetic patients (DB) and controls (Control) was detected by RT-qPCR. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma AK077216 for DR. It was found that plasma AK077216 was downregulated only in DR patients but not in diabetic patients (no obvious complications) comparing to healthy controls. Downregulation of AK077216 distinguished DR patients from diabetic patients and healthy controls. High glucose treatment failed to significantly affect AK077216 expression in cells of human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. MiR-383 was inversely correlated with AK077216 in DR patients. AK077216 overexpression caused miR-383 downregulation, but miR-383 overexpression did not significantly alter AK077216 expression. AK077216 overexpression inhibited ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, while miR-383 overexpression played an opposite role and attenuated the effects of AK077216 overexpression. Therefore, AK077216 is downregulated in diabetic retinopathy and inhibited the apoptosis of ARPE-19 cells by downregulating miR-383. ",0

The relationship between serum markers and quantitative hepatic collagen content was also determined. Liver biopsy samples from 513 subjects enrolled in the HALT-C trial were assigned Ishak fibrosis scores. The collagen content of 386 sirius-red stained, nonfragmented biopsy samples was quantified using computerized morphometry. Serum tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), amino-terminal peptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), hyaluronic acid (HA), and YKL-40 levels were determined using commercially available assays.Sixty-two percent of patients had noncirrhotic fibrosis (Ishak stage 2-4) whereas 38% had cirrhosis (Ishak stage 5,6). Multivariate analysis identified a 3-variable model (HA, TIMP-1, and platelet count) that had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.81 for estimating the presence of cirrhosis. This model was significantly better than that derived from the cirrhosis discriminant score (AUROC 0.70), the AST-to-platelet ratio (AUROC 0.73), and a prior model developed in HALT-C patients (AUROC 0.79). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the serum fibrosis markers correlated substantially better with Ishak fibrosis scores than with the log hepatic collagen content (AUROC 0.84 versus 0.72). CONCLUSION: A 3-variable model consisting of serum HA, TIMP-1, and platelet count was better than other published models in identifying cirrhosis in HALT-C Trial subjects. The stronger correlation of the serum markers with Ishak scores suggests that serum fibrosis markers reflect the pattern of fibrosis more closely than the quantity of hepatic collagen.",0

We report an unusual case of lepromatous leprosy (LL) with annular lesions resembling erythema gyratum repens. A 55-year-old man presented with a symmetrical, hypopigmented, and erythematous rash of bizarre appearance over the lateral aspect of the upper arm, and anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk of two months' duration. He gave a history of self-resolving episodes of bilateral pedal edema, and numbness and pricking sensations in both the hands and feet, which had occurred intermittently over the previous six years. An ulcer measuring 2 cm in size was present over the adjacent surface of the right first and second toes. The bilateral ulnar and radial cutaneous nerves were symmetrically thickened. Slit-skin smears revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli. Skin biopsy from the trunk showed collections of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells in the dermis and around the blood vessels. The patient was diagnosed with LL and started on multibacillary multi-drug therapy. Lepromatous leprosy can have varied clinical manifestations and is often a great imitator. However, the skin smear positivity, even in normal skin, symmetrical cutaneous and peripheral nerve involvement, and histopathology in the present patient were indicative of LL. This report highlights a rare presentation of leprosy. Clinicians should be aware of these rare manifestations as lepromatous cases still occur in certain regions. ",0

845,24670167,Patches of disorganization in the neocortex of children with autism,"BACKGROUND: Autism involves early brain overgrowth and dysfunction, which is most strongly evident in the prefrontal cortex. As assessed on pathological analysis, an excess of neurons in the prefrontal cortex among children with autism signals a disturbance in prenatal development and may be concomitant with abnormal cell type and laminar development. METHODS: To systematically examine neocortical architecture during the early years after the onset of autism, we used RNA in situ hybridization with a panel of layer- and cell-type-specific molecular markers to phenotype cortical microstructure. We assayed markers for neurons and glia, along with genes that have been implicated in the risk of autism, in prefrontal, temporal, and occipital neocortical tissue from postmortem samples obtained from children with autism and unaffected children between the ages of 2 and 15 years. RESULTS: We observed focal patches of abnormal laminar cytoarchitecture and cortical disorganization of neurons, but not glia, in prefrontal and temporal cortical tissue from 10 of 11 children with autism and from 1 of 11 unaffected children. We observed heterogeneity between cases with respect to cell types that were most abnormal in the patches and the layers that were most affected by the pathological features. No cortical layer was uniformly spared, with the clearest signs of abnormal expression in layers 4 and 5. Three-dimensional reconstruction of layer markers confirmed the focal geometry and size of patches. CONCLUSIONS: In this small, explorative study, we found focal disruption of cortical laminar architecture in the cortexes of a majority of young children with autism. Our data support a probable dysregulation of layer formation and layer-specific neuronal differentiation at prenatal developmental stages. (Funded by the Simons Foundation and others.).",0
846,8596376,"Prevention of deep-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement: direct thrombin inhibition with recombinant hirudin, CGP 39393","BACKGROUND: The frequency of thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery continues to be high despite prophylaxis. New agents such as CGP 39393, a recombinant form of hirudin, may be more effective than existing therapies. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicentre, European study the efficacy of three doses of CGP 39393, in comparison with unfractionated heparin, were examined in 1119 patients undergoing elective hip surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to receive by subcutaneous injection either 10, 15, or 20 mg of CGP 39393 twice daily or 5000 IU of heparin three times daily. All treatments were started just before surgery and continued for 8-11 days, until bilateral venography was performed. FINDINGS: The occurrence of thromboembolism was significantly reduced in patients treated with CGP 39393 compared to heparin. The frequency of deep-vein thrombosis was 34.2% in the heparin group as compared to 23.9% (p=0.0113), 18.4% (p=0.0003), and 17.7% (p=0.0001) in the 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg CGP 39393 groups, respectively. At all dose levels, CGP 39393 was more effective than heparin in preventing proximal deep-vein thrombosis. The frequency of proximal thrombosis was 19.6% in the heparin group as compared to 8.5% (p<0.001), 3.1% (p<0.001), and 2.4% (p<0.001) in the 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg CGP 39393 groups, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: This study indicates that specific inhibition of thrombin by prophylactic CGP 39393 significantly reduces thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing total hip replacement.",1

849,16507377,An integrated analysis of thirteen trials summarizing the long-term safety of alefacept in psoriasis patients who have received up to nine courses of therapy,"""BACKGROUND: Information on longer-term safety and tolerability is needed to confidently prescribe alefacept therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis beyond 1 or 2 courses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to further examine the safety profile of alefacept by integrating data from clinical trials involving patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who received up to 9 courses of therapy over a 5-year period. METHODS: Data from 13 clinical trials conducted in patients with plaque psoriasis were integrated because they had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria and assessments. Patients who enrolled in the analyzed trials were aged > or =15 years with chronic plaque psoriasis for > or =12 months that involved > or =10% of body surface area, and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts above the lower limit of normal (>404 cells/microL). The incidences of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, discontinuations for AEs, infections, serious infections, malignancies, and anti-alefacept antibodies were summarized for each course of alefacept. The incidence of infections was stratified according to CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (<250 cells/microL vs > or =250 cells/microL). RESULTS: Data from 13 clinical trials of alefacept were integrated and summarized (multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies, n = 6; multicenter, open-label studies, n = 5; other, n = 2). The analyzed population (n = 1869) included 1291 (69.1%) men and 578 (30.9%) women, between the ages of 15 and 84 years (mean, 44.8 years), of whom 1648 (88.2%) were white. Weights ranged from 40 kg to 206 kg (mean, 90.0 kg). A total of 1369 of these patients had been included in a previous analysis. Among the most commonly reported AEs in each treatment course were headache (0%-14.2%), nasopharyngitis (7.7%-25.0%), influenza (0%-8.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (0%-12.5%), and pruritus (0%-7.5%). The rates of discontinuations due to AEs (0%-4.8%), serious AEs (0%-4.8%), serious infections (0%-0.9%), or malignancies (0%-4.8%) did not appear to increase with repeated exposure. Fewer than 1 % of patients in each course developed a serious infection. No opportunistic infections or infection-related deaths were reported. The incidence of infections appeared to be unrelated to CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. Fewer than 2.5% of patients tested positive for anti-alefacept antibodies during any course of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated analysis of data from 13 trials with 1869 patients supports the safety and tolerability of alefacept for longer-term treatment of psoriasis.""",1

METHODS: RA patients who had never taken MTX (n = 637) were randomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo + MTX (group 1), golimumab 100 mg + placebo (group 2), golimumab 50 mg + MTX (group 3), or golimumab 100 mg + MTX (group 4) every 4 weeks. Nonresponders based on week 28 swollen/tender joint counts changed treatment as follows: group 1 added golimumab 50 mg, group 2 added MTX, group 3 increased golimumab to 100 mg, and group 4 had no change. Most group 1 patients (85%) initiated golimumab 50 mg + MTX at week 28 or subsequently at week 52. After the last patient completed week 52 and blinding was broken, the investigator could escalate golimumab to 100 mg and/or adjust MTX. The co-primary end points (week 24 American College of Rheumatology criteria for 50% improvement [ACR50] response and week 52 change in Sharp/van der Heijde score [SHS]) have been published previously. We now detail week 52 major secondary end points (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] disability index [DI] scores and SHS among patients with a baseline C-reactive protein [CRP] level >1.0 mg/dl) and week 104 findings. RESULTS: At week 52 for combined groups 3 and 4 versus group 1, the respective proportions of patients achieving ACR20 and ACR50 responses were 63.2% versus 51.9% (P = 0.017) and 45.3% versus 35.6% (P = 0.044). Respective week 52 mean HAQ DI improvements were 0.70 versus 0.58 (P = 0.053); mean SHS changes were 0.41 versus 1.37 (P = 0.006) among all patients and 0.74 versus 2.16 (P = 0.003) in patients with a CRP level >1.0 mg/dl. Improvements were maintained through week 104. Golimumab + MTX for 2 years yielded statistically less radiographic progression than initial MTX or golimumab 100 mg monotherapy. Golimumab safety profiles through weeks 24, 52, and 104 were generally consistent with those observed in other golimumab studies. CONCLUSION: In RA patients who had never taken MTX, up to 2 years of golimumab + MTX yielded sustained improvements in clinical signs/symptoms, physical function, and radiographic progression.""",1
851,1944471,Changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels and body weight in Tarahumara Indians after consumption of an affluent diet,"""BACKGROUND: Major new public health problems occur in developing countries as they become more affluent and change their traditional dietary patterns. To study this phenomenon in microcosm, we substituted an """"affluent"""" diet for the traditional diet of a group of Tarahumara Indians, a Mexican people known to consume a low-fat, high-fiber diet and to have a very low incidence of risk factors for coronary heart disease. METHODS: Thirteen Tarahumara Indians (five women and eight men [including one adolescent]) consumed their traditional diet (2700 kcal per day) for one week, and were then fed a diet typical of affluent societies, which contained excessive calories (4100 kcal per day), total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, for five weeks. RESULTS: After five weeks of consuming the affluent diet, the subjects' mean (+/- SE) plasma cholesterol level increased by 31 percent, from 121 +/- 5 to 159 +/- 6 mg per deciliter (3.13 +/- 0.13 to 4.11 +/- 0.16 mmol per liter, P less than 0.001). The increase in the plasma cholesterol level was primarily in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, which rose 39 percent, from 72 +/- 3 to 100 +/- 4 mg per deciliter (1.86 +/- 0.08 to 2.59 +/- 0.10 mmol per liter, P less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, usually low in this population, increased by 31 percent, from 32 +/- 2 to 42 +/- 3 mg per deciliter (0.83 +/- 0.05 to 1.09 +/- 0.08 mmol per liter). Consequently, the ratio of LDL to HDL levels changed little (2.25 with the base-line diet and 2.38 with the affluent diet). Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent, from 91 +/- 8 to 108 +/- 11 mg per deciliter (1.03 +/- 0.09 to 1.22 +/- 0.12 mmol per liter, P less than 0.05), with a significant increase in the very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride fraction. All the subjects gained weight, with a mean increase of 3.8 kg (7 percent). CONCLUSIONS: When Tarahumara Indians from a population with virtually no coronary risk factors consumed for a short time a hypercaloric diet typical of a more affluent society, they had dramatic increases in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and body weight. If sustained, such changes might increase their risk of coronary heart disease.""",0

Sound social networks have been shown to slow the process of decline in the elderly, and currently little is known about the social networks associated with elder self-neglect. The aim of this study was to explore the social networks associated with elder self-neglect compared with a matched-control group. Ninety-one Adult Protective Services-validated cases of elder self-neglect were compared on formal and informal social network factors with 91controls matched for age, race, gender, and socio-economic status. Elders in the self-neglect group were significantly less likely to (1) Live with a spouse, (2) Live with others, (3) Have weekly contact with children or siblings, (4) Visit with neighbors and friends and (5) Participate in religious activities. Less adequate social resources related to family, friends, and religious affiliations are significantly associated with elder self-neglect. ",0
853,7608823,Hepatic toxicity associated with 2'-3' dideoxyinosine in children with AIDS,"Among 34 children with AIDS enrolled in a trial with 2'-3' dideoxyinosine (ddI), six (aged 1-6 years) developed liver abnormalities within 2-18 months after institution of ddI. Two children died of fulminant hepatic failure (one had also an adenovirus infection), and four had a striking elevation of alkaline phosphatases (AP: 1120-7000 IU/L). All of them received sulfa drugs and antifungic treatment with ketoconazole or fluconazole. Three had a serology positive for hepatitis C virus. The evolution of liver enzymes following withdrawal and rechallenge with ddI in the children with elevated AP was an indication of drug-induced toxicity in two patients. In both of the others, readministration of ddI did not cause any subsequent problems. Liver histology in the patients with fulminant hepatitis showed an extensive hepatic necrosis. Liver biopsy done in two other patients revealed a mild granulomatous hepatitis in one and nonspecific changes (i.e., steatosis and a mild inflammation) in the other. Hepatic toxicity has been described with ddI and other nucleoside analogs in adult patients. These six children had many potential causes of liver disease. It may be that ddI is not hepatotoxic per se but that it precipitates liver disease in predisposed patients. We recommend that liver functions be carefully monitored when using this drug.",1

After the 2-week diet period a bile fistula was established and rates of taurocholate, tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. During the infusion experiments taurocholate production was calculated from the difference in specific activity of [14C]taurocholate between infusate and bile, whereas tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate synthesis was derived directly from their secretion rates after pool depletion. Both the 0.5% cholate and taurocholate diet suppressed tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion nearly totally, but only cholate led to a prolonged inhibition taurocholate synthesis. The diets stimulated total bile acid secretion and expanded the total bile acid pool size 2- to 3-fold, but they also prompted a dramatic increase in the biliary secretion of taurodeoxycholate. In contrast, colectomized animals did not secrete taurodeoxycholate following the cholate diet and, despite a comparable increase in bile acid pool size, tauromuricholate and taurochenodeoxycholate secretion was inhibited to a lesser extent. In addition, the rate of bile acid secretion and synthesis was significantly enhanced when compared to that of intact rats. To determine whether taurocholate affected bile acid synthesis directly, the bile acid was infused intravenously or intraduodenally at varying rates up to 300 mumoles per kg per hr for 54 hr, i.e. a rate exceeding normal total bile acid secretion in these acute bile fistula animals nearly 3-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
856,11513501,"Discovering the person with Alzheimer's disease: cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects","The person-centred approach to dementia care emerges from a new emphasis on the experience of the person with dementia. The person is seen as attempting to manage and cope with their difficulties, through a variety of coping mechanisms. Some are able to seek to maximize their cognitive capacities, and there are a number of strategies now available to assist in this process. However, the emotional aspects merit increased attention, with more awareness needed of the range of powerful emotions that may be present, and of the possibility of therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Many of the difficult behaviours seen in dementia may be understood more fully with an appreciation of their emotional underpinning, in feelings of anger, fear, insecurity and hopelessness. The interaction between caregiver strain and challenging behaviour also merits further exploration. The person-centred approach has many implications for practice, as well as for research. The perspective of the person with dementia, and outcomes reflecting that perspective, must be represented in research studies in dementia care. Caregivers, whether family members or paid workers, require additional support in order to recognize the person's needs and to meet them in ways which enable the person's identity and full human value to be upheld.

858,26257816,Strong Manual Acupuncture Manipulation Could Better Inhibit Spike Frequency of the Dorsal Horn Neurons in Rats with Acute Visceral Nociception,"Afferent impulses from visceral nociception can be regulated by acupuncture at spinal cord level; however, the effects of different manual acupuncture (MA) manipulations on the afferent impulses are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the spike frequency of excitatory gastric-related wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in spinal dorsal horn (SDH) following acute gastric distension (GD) in rats and compared their responses to MA manipulations with four different frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 Hz) at Zusanli (ST36). Results indicated that the spike frequency was increased by acute GD stimulation. Under acute GD circumstances, the spike frequency was further activated by weak MA stimulation (0.5 and 1 Hz), while being significantly inhibited by strong MA stimulation (2 and 3 Hz). After 10 minutes of the strong MA stimulation, same intensity of acute GD caused less spike frequency. Our previous researches had demonstrated that different MA manipulations could increase spike frequency in an intensity-dependent manner in normal rats; these findings suggest that acupuncture may have different modulatory effects depending on the state of the stomach. Since neuronal spike frequency was related to the level of nociception, the results suggest that strong MA manipulation may have better effect on acute visceral nociception.  ",0

Experimental groups included sciatic nerve transection with and without repair and crush lesions. The degree of autotomy was measured using a standard grading system. There were statistically significant differences between the strains in the transected group in terms of both degree of autotomy and the time of onset of its appearance. The repair group showed a shorter mean time of onset, lower maximal scores, and lower percentage of affected animals. Autotomy was absent in the nerve crush group and in all Lewis rats. In experimental studies when the status of the foot is critical (e.g., to evaluate functional walking patterns) Lewis rats appear to be the most appropriate strain to utilize. These results suggest that there are definite strain differences in the degree of autotomy following nerve transection or repair. ",0

Tedizolid pharmacokinetics in subjects with severe renal impairment without dialysis support was compared with that of matched control subjects with normal renal function. Effects of hemodialysis on tedizolid pharmacokinetics were determined in a separate cohort of subjects undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Effects of hepatic impairment on tedizolid pharmacokinetics were determined in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and compared with those of matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Each participant received a single oral (hepatic impairment) or intravenous (renal impairment) dose of tedizolid phosphate at 200 mg; hemodialysis subjects received two doses (separated by 7 days), before and after dialysis, in a crossover fashion. The pharmacokinetics of tedizolid was similar in subjects with severe renal impairment and controls ( approximately 8% lower area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], with a nearly identical peak concentration) and in subjects undergoing hemodialysis before and after tedizolid phosphate administration ( approximately 9% lower AUC, with a 15% higher peak concentration); <10% of the dose was removed during 4 h of hemodialysis. Tedizolid pharmacokinetics was only minimally altered in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; the AUC was increased approximately 22% and 34%, respectively, compared with that of subjects in the control group. Tedizolid phosphate was generally well tolerated in all participants. These results suggest that tedizolid phosphate dose adjustments are not necessary in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment.

862,12027060,Guidelines for using antiretroviral agents among HIV-infected adults and adolescents. Recommendations of the Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV,"""The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information has introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. Treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website (http://www.hivatis.org).""",1
863,24114775,Endothelin-1 receptor A blocker darusentan decreases hepatic changes and improves liver repopulation after cell transplantation in rats,"Cell transplantation-induced hepatic ischemia and recruitment of vasoconstrictors (e.g., endothelin-1; Edn1) leads to clearance of transplanted cells and poses problems for liver repopulation. Therefore, we determined whether darusentan (DAR), which potently blocks Edn1 receptor type A, could benefit cell engraftment. We transplanted primary F344 rat hepatocytes with or without DAR in dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient rats. Analysis of microcirculatory events included hepatic ischemia, endothelial injury, including with gene expression arrays, and activations of Kupffer cells (KCs), neutrophils, or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The retrorsine-partial hepatectomy model was used for liver repopulation studies. Whether DAR was directly cytoprotective was examined in cultured rat hepatocytes or CFSC-8B rat HSCs. We found that DAR induced hepatic sinusoidal vasodilation, caused more transplanted cells to be deposited in liver parenchyma, and decreased hepatic ischemia and endothelial injury. This lessened perturbations in expression of endothelial biology genes, including regulators of vessel tone, inflammation, cell adhesion, or cell damage, versus drug-untreated controls. Moreover, in DAR-treated animals, cell transplantation-induced activation of KCs, albeit not of neutrophils, decreased, and fewer HSCs expressed desmin. In DAR-treated rats, improvements in cell engraftment led to greater extent of liver repopulation, compared to drug-untreated controls. In cell-culture assays, DAR did not stimulate release of cytoprotective factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, from HSCs. Moreover, DAR did not protect hepatocytes from tumor necrosis factor alpha- or oxidative stress-induced toxicity. Endothelin receptor A blockade in vitro did not improve engraftment of subsequently transplanted hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of DAR decreases hepatic ischemia-related events and thus indirectly improves cell engraftment and liver repopulation. This vascular mechanism may permit the development of combinatorial drug-based regimens to help optimize cell therapy.",0

No significant differences were found in the rate of complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, or molecular response by a 4.5 log reduction on the international scale between the organ function cohorts. Dasatinib- or nilotinib-treated patients with baseline renal dysfunction had a greater incidence of transient reversible acute kidney injury (P = .011 and P < .001), and nilotinib-treated patients with renal dysfunction had a greater incidence of bleeding (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients with CML-CP and mild to moderate renal or liver dysfunction can be safely treated with front-line dasatinib or nilotinib and can achieve response rates similar to those of patients with CML-CP without organ dysfunction.",1
865,19483646,"Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim) administered for 3 years as adjuvant therapy of stages II(T4), III, and IV melanoma","""A hypothesis generating study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prolonged (3 y) administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim) as surgical adjuvant therapy in patients with melanoma at high risk of recurrence. Ninety-eight evaluable patients with stages II(T4), III, or IV melanoma were given prolonged treatment with GM-CSF after surgical resection of disease. The GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously in 28-day cycles, such that a dose of 125 microg/m2 was delivered daily for 14 days followed by 14 days rest. Treatment cycles continued for 3 years or until disease recurrence, which could not be surgically excised. Patients were evaluated for toxicity, disease-free survival, and melanoma-specific survival. Prolonged administration of GM-CSF was well tolerated; grade 1 or 2 side effects occurred in 82% of the patients. There were no grade 3 or 4 treatment-related side effects. Two patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia after completion of 3 years of GM-CSF administration. With a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the median melanoma-specific survival has not yet been reached. The 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 60%. The current study has expanded the preliminary evidence on GM-CSF as adjuvant therapy of patients with melanoma who are at high risk for recurrence.""",1
866,12198661,Bacterial motif DNA as an adjuvant for the breakdown of immune self-tolerance to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,"Bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotide motifs is immunostimulatory to mammals, skewing CD4(+) T-cell responses toward the Th1 phenotype. Autoreactive T-cell responses seen in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are typically of the Th1 phenotype, raising the possibility that bacterial DNA might play a role in the generation of pathologic autoimmunity. We therefore studied the effects of CpG motif-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) on responses to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC, the autoantigen in PBC) in a murine model. Sensitization of SJL/J mice with non-self-PDC has been shown to result in induction of autoreactive T-cell responses to PDC sharing characteristics with those seen in patients with PBC. Administration of CpG ODN to SJL/J mice at the time of sensitization with PDC resulted in a significant skewing of splenic T-cell response to self-PDC, with significant augmentation of the Th1 cytokine response (interleukin [IL] 2 and interferon [IFN] gamma) and reduction of the Th2 response (IL-4 and IL-10). In fact, CpG ODN seemed to be more effective at biasing the response phenotype and as effective at inducing liver histologic change as complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), the standard adjuvant used for induction of Th1 responses in murine autoimmune and infectious immunity models. In conclusion, our findings raise the possibility that bacteria play a role in the development of autoimmunity (in PBC at least) through the potential of their DNA to shift the T-cell responses toward the phenotype associated with autoimmune damage. Moreover, this study suggests caution in the therapeutic use of CpG ODN as vaccine adjuvants.",0
867,18344759,A prospective study of early intraocular pressure changes after a single intravitreal triamcinolone injection,"To prospectively monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) and gonioscopy changes within the first month after a single 4-mg intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVK) (Kenalog, Briston-Meyers Squibb, New York). Prospective comparative interventional case series. A consecutive series of 28 eyes of 14 patients with no prior intravitreal injections or history of glaucoma were prospectively enrolled. After baseline evaluation in both eyes, including IOP, gonioscopy, and optic nerve evaluation, a single 4-mg IVK was given in a standard sterile fashion in the eye to be treated. Eyes received IVK for macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusions and in conjunction with photodynamic therapy for choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, and high myopia. The fellow eye served as the control. After the injection, IOP and gonioscopy were repeated at 1, 2, and 4-week intervals in both eyes. Of the 14 patients, the 5 women and 9 men had a mean age of 67.6 years. Mean baseline IOP of the treated and fellow control eyes were similar at 15.9 versus 16.6 mm Hg, respectively. The control eyes maintained a small IOP range (15.6 to 16.6 mm Hg) during the 1-month follow-up period. In the treated eyes, the mean maximum IOP was 54% above baseline during follow-up, compared with 11% for control eyes. Six of 14 (43%) treated eyes had IOP elevation to 24 mm Hg or higher with mean change of 8.6 mm Hg and a mean maximum IOP of 32.1 mm Hg. There was no correlation between IOP rise and age, sex, diagnosis, or optic nerve appearance. However, during the course of the study, 4 of 6 (67%) of the treated eyes that required topical drops for the IOP elevation had documented abnormal inferior angle changes characterized by pigmented particulate matter in the inferior angle not present at the baseline exam. The most frequent time point for an IOP elevation that required treatment was at 2-week postinjection. No eyes required surgical management of IOP during the course of this 4-week study. We observed a significant IOP rise in eyes after a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg of triamcinolone within 1 month of injection. In this study, the most frequent time point that required IOP treatment was at 2-week postinjection, suggesting that early and frequent monitoring of IOP should be considered. Two-thirds of eyes that required medical control of IOP developed gonioscopy changes, characterized by particulate matter in the inferior angle, not present at baseline. Eyes that developed gonioscopic changes were 5 times more likely to be treated for IOP elevation than those without gonioscopic findings. ",0
868,19710593,"Efficacy and safety of etravirine in treatment-experienced, HIV-1 patients: pooled 48 week analysis of two randomized, controlled trials","""OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and virologic resistance profile of etravirine (TMC125), a next-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, over 48 weeks in treatment-experienced adults infected with HIV-1 strains resistant to a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and other antiretrovirals. DESIGN: DUET-1 (NCT00254046) and DUET-2 (NCT00255099) are two identically designed, randomized, double-blind phase III trials. METHODS: Patients received twice-daily etravirine 200 mg or placebo, each plus a background regimen of darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and optional enfuvirtide. Eligible patients had documented nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance, at least three primary protease inhibitor mutations at screening and were on a stable but virologically failing regimen for at least 8 weeks, with plasma viral load more than 5000 copies/ml. Pooled 48-week data from the two trials are presented. RESULTS: Patients (1203) were randomized and treated (n = 599, etravirine; n = 604, placebo). Significantly more patients in the etravirine than in the placebo group achieved viral load less than 50 copies/ml at week 48 (61 vs. 40%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Significantly fewer patients in the etravirine group experienced at least one confirmed or probable AIDS-defining illness/death (6 vs. 10%; P = 0.0408). Safety and tolerability in the etravirine group was comparable to the placebo group. Rash was the only adverse event to occur at a significantly higher incidence in the etravirine group (19 vs. 11%, respectively, P < 0.0001), occurring primarily in the second week of treatment. CONCLUSION: At 48 weeks, treatment-experienced patients receiving etravirine plus background regimen had statistically superior and durable virologic responses (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) than those receiving placebo plus background regimen, with comparable tolerability and no new safety signals reported since week 24.""",1
869,20969501,When do the aminotransferases rise after acute acetaminophen overdose?,"CONTEXT: Rising aminotransferases (ATs) [either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are one of the first signs of hepatotoxicity following acetaminophen (APAP)] overdose (OD). However, the timing and speed of such rises are not well characterized, hampering early risk prediction. OBJECTIVE: To describe the kinetics of AT release in acute APAP OD patients who develop hepatotoxicity despite treatment. METHODS: A descriptive study of acute APAP OD patients with peak AT > 1,000 IU/L taken from the derivation subset of the Canadian Acetaminophen Overdose Study (CAOS), a large, multicenter retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for APAP poisoning. RESULTS: Of 2,488 hospital admissions for acute APAP OD, 94 met inclusion criteria. Treatment with acetylcysteine, mostly intravenously, was begun in all cases within 24 h of ingestion. The initial AT concentration was already elevated in most patients at presentation [median 211 (IQR 77-511) IU/L obtained at 15.3 (12.1-19.2) h postingestion], and exceeded 100 IU/L in almost all patients within 24 h of ingestion. Serum AT concentrations rose rapidly [doubling time 9.5 h (95% CI: 8.7-10.4 h)], especially in patients who developed AT > 1,000 IU/L within 48 h of ingestion. Coagulopathy was worse in these patients and in those with an AT > 250 IU/L during the first 12 h of treatment with acetylcysteine. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal and rapidly doubling AT at presentation is more typical in severely poisoned patients, as judged by the effects on clotting. These data suggest that risk prediction instruments may be improved by incorporating both the serum AT concentration at initiation of antidotal therapy and its rate of change. Further studies using such an approach are warranted.",1

871,30743035,Pediatric Cranial Fasciitis: Discussion of Cases and Systematic Review of the Literature,"Cranial fasciitis is a rare benign mass that typically presents in pediatric patients from 3 weeks to 6 years of age. It is classified as a subset of nodular fasciitis and was first reported in 1980. This study evaluates the literature for common characteristics that may affect diagnosis and treamtent. We describe the case of a 13-month-old girl with a history of accidental head trauma 7 months before presentation and the case of a 5-month-old girl with an expansile skull lesion. We also performed a systematic review of the reported data on cranial fasciitis, including a total of 57 reported studies with 80 unique cases. There were 80 total cases reviewed in the literature. There was a male predominence, 1.75:1. The average age at presentation was 5.2 years. The most common causes for this lesion were idiopathic (65%), blunt trauma (14%) and radiation therapy (7%). Overall, there was a 9% recurrence rate following treatment. We report the characteristics at presentation, including, to the best of our knowledge, the first account of gender differences, and the treatment modalities used in the included studies and the implications in relation to the recurrence rates.

872,17975719,State policy environment and delayed or forgone care among children with special health care needs,"To evaluate if children with special health care needs (CSHCN) residing in states with more generous public insurance programs were less likely to report delayed or forgone care. We used multilevel modeling to evaluate state policy characteristics after controlling for individual characteristics. We used the 2001 National Survey of CSHCN for individual-level data (N=33,317) merged with state-level data, which included measures of the state's public insurance programs (Medicaid eligibility and enrollment, spending on Medicaid, SCHIP and Title V, and income eligibility levels), state poverty level and provider supply (including pediatric primary care and specialty providers). We also included a variable for state waivers for CSHCN requiring institutional level care. Delayed or forgone care significantly varied among CSHCN between states, net of individual characteristics. Of all the state characteristics studied, only the Medicaid income eligibility levels influenced the risk of experiencing delayed care. CSHCN living in states with higher income eligibility thresholds or more generous eligibility levels were less likely to experience delayed care (OR 0.89(0.80,0.99); P<or=0.05). By analyzing child health policy in the context of individual characteristics that may place a child at risk for delayed care, we determined that improving Medicaid eligibility levels improved the process of care for CSHCN.

874,594638,Adenine metabolism in man. 1. After intravenous and peroral administration,"The basal plasma concentration of adenine and its renal excretion was studied in two men. For its analysis partly new chromatographic techniques were developed. The plasma concentration varied around 70 nmol/l; the renal excretion rate was, as reported earlier by other investigators, around 10 nmol/min. Loadings, intravenously during about 3 h and orally, both with about 30 nmol adenine per kg body mass revealed that most of the adenine was metabolized to nucleotide form. In the experiments with intravenous administration of adenine only about 2% of the given dose appeared in the urine as adenine and somewhat less as the easily precipitable metabolite 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. In the peroral loads, with higher plasma adenine concentrations, the ratios of the renally excreted two compounds were one to a few per cent higher. ",0
875,17825686,Sunitinib malate for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"""BACKGROUND: Sunitinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 26, 2006, for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in patients who have failed to respond to imatinib or were unable to tolerate it. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sunitinib; potential drug interactions; and the results of clinical trials evaluating its efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: Pertinent literature was identified by searches of MEDLINE (1966-January 31, 2007), the American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts database (2000-2007 annual meetings/symposia and previous meetings), and the FDA Web site (October 2006). Search terms included, but were not limited to, sunitinib, SUl1248, renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, adverse events, and clinical trial. Additional publications were found by scanning the reference lists of the identified articles. RESULTS: Sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors. Its Tmax is reached within 6 to 12 hours, and food does not appear to affect its bioavailability. Sunitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to an active metabolite, SU12662, which is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to an inactive moiety. The parent compound and active metabolite have similar biochemical activity and potency and reach similar plasma concentrations. Sunitinib and SU12662 have a tl/2 of 40 to 60 hours and 80 to 110 hours, respectively. Steady-state concentrations of both active entities are reached after 10 to 14 days of therapy. In a Phase III trial comparing sunitinib with interferon-alfa (IFN-00 as first-line therapy for mRCC, sunitinib was associated with a median progression-free survival of 11 months, compared with 5 months with IFN-cz (P < 0.001). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating sunitinib as second-line therapy for GIST found a median time to progression of 28.9 weeks in the sunitinib arm, compared with 7 weeks in the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.28; P < 0.001). In Phase II trials, sunitinib also had anti-tumor activity in patients with breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, and non-small cell lung cancer. Further evaluation in these tumors, as well as in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, may lead to expanded indications. The approved dose of sunitinib is 50 mg/d PO for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest; this pattern is repeated until tumor progression or the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects. The most common clinical toxicities attributable to sunitinib include diarrhea, mucositis/stomatitis, hypertension, rash, skin discoloration, and altered taste, whereas commonly occurring laboratory abnormalities have been seen in association with gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity, and hematologic toxicity. Of grade 3/4 toxicities occurring with sunitinib (which are relatively uncommon [<10%]), those that are clinically important include hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, and hand-foot syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of mRCC and GIST. Evidence for long-term clinical benefit in renal cell cancer and other tumors awaits the results of ongoing trials.""",1
876,7858459,Acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid,"A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers. It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.",1
877,8848594,Relationship between the fall in growth hormone secretion at birth and the onset of nonshivering thermogenesis is independent of beta adrenergic stimulation,"At the time of birth, many rapid metabolic changes occur including the initiation of nonshivering thermogenesis and a rapid fall in growth hormone concentrations. To evaluate the interaction between these events 5 fetal sheep were studied at 135-144 days' gestation. The fetuses were first cooled 2.22 +/- 0.19 degrees C by circulating cold water through a coil placed around the fetal thorax and then ventilated with oxygen through an exteriorized tracheostomy tube to raise fetal arterial PO2 above 67.5 +/- 14.1 Torr. An hour later the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was infused intravenously for 90 min. The fetuses were then separated from the placenta by occluding the umbilical cord. After 60 min the cooling and then the isoproterenol infusion were stopped and the responses monitored. Basal plasma free fatty acid (FFA 35 +/- 5 microEq L-1) and growth hormone (GH 141 +/- 12 ng mL-1) concentrations were not significantly altered by cooling alone, but oxygenation modestly increased plasma FFA to 237 +/- 55 microEq L-1 (P < 0.01) while GH concentrations fell to 58 +/- 27 ng mL-1 (P < 0.05). Isoproterenol administration did not significantly affect either FFA or GH concentrations. Occlusion of the umbilical cord caused a rapid nearly threefold increase in plasma FFA concentrations to 903 +/- 71 microEq L-1 (P < 0.01) and a fall in the same proportions in GH concentrations to 16 +/- 2 ng mL-1 (P < 0.005). Maximal fetal oxygen consumption was 24.2 +/- 4.4 mL kg-1 min-1. Cessation of cooling induced a significant fall in plasma FFA to 480 +/- 58 microEq L-1 (P < 0.01) and rise in GH concentrations to 46 +/- 5 ng mL-1 (P < 0.01). Following the withdrawal of isoproterenol, the fall in plasma FFA and rise in GH concentrations continued while the fetal oxygen uptake fell to 6.4 +/- 1.7 mliter kg-1 mL-1 (P < 0.01). During the study the variation in plasma GH was inversely correlated with changes in FFA concentrations (R = 0.77, P < 0.001). This study confirms that the major factors initiating nonshivering thermogenesis at birth are: sympathetic stimulation from cutaneous cooling, which was not significantly enhanced by isoproterenol; adequate oxygenation; and removal of placental inhibitor(s). The findings are in agreement with a causal relationship between the initiation of nonshivering thermogenesis and consequent rise in FFA concentrations and the rapid fall in circulating GH concentrations after birth in the lamb, independent of beta adrenergic stimulation.

878,16529424,Determination of molecular parameters of linear and circular scleroglucan coexisting in ternary mixtures using light scattering,"A combination of static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS) is applied here to determine molecular parameters for coexisting linear and circular scleroglucan polymers of similar molecular weights, dissolved in water, that is, forming a ternary system. The weight-average molecular weights, M(w), were determined to be 3.2 x 10(5) and 3.9 x 10(5) g/mol for the circular and linear molecules, respectively, whereas the z-average radius of gyration, R(g), was found to be equal to 41 nm for the circular molecules and 136 nm for the linear ones. These values are within a physically reasonable range in view of the heterogeneity of the samples. This study confirms that decomposition of total scattering intensities deduced from the dynamic properties can be used to determine molecular parameters of populations of molecules of equal M(w) but different morphologies present in ternary mixtures.

879,22998340,A trial of sugar-free or sugar-sweetened beverages and body weight in children,"BACKGROUND: The consumption of beverages that contain sugar is associated with overweight, possibly because liquid sugars do not lead to a sense of satiety, so the consumption of other foods is not reduced. However, data are lacking to show that the replacement of sugar-containing beverages with noncaloric beverages diminishes weight gain. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month trial involving 641 primarily normal-weight children from 4 years 10 months to 11 years 11 months of age. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 250 ml (8 oz) per day of a sugar-free, artificially sweetened beverage (sugar-free group) or a similar sugar-containing beverage that provided 104 kcal (sugar group). Beverages were distributed through schools. At 18 months, 26% of the children had stopped consuming the beverages; the data from children who did not complete the study were imputed. RESULTS: The z score for the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) increased on average by 0.02 SD units in the sugar-free group and by 0.15 SD units in the sugar group; the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was -0.21 to -0.05. Weight increased by 6.35 kg in the sugar-free group as compared with 7.37 kg in the sugar group (95% CI for the difference, -1.54 to -0.48). The skinfold-thickness measurements, waist-to-height ratio, and fat mass also increased significantly less in the sugar-free group. Adverse events were minor. When we combined measurements at 18 months in 136 children who had discontinued the study with those in 477 children who completed the study, the BMI z score increased by 0.06 SD units in the sugar-free group and by 0.12 SD units in the sugar group (P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Masked replacement of sugar-containing beverages with noncaloric beverages reduced weight gain and fat accumulation in normal-weight children.

880,31396498,Why Children's Hospitals Are Unique and So Essential,"Children's hospitals were created in the nineteenth century, first in France and then in England. They were designed to provide optimal care to infants, children, and adolescents in a specific environment where parents were admitted and where the special needs of children were catered for. No other system currently offers so many advantages as the multidisciplinary teams with their pediatricians, surgeons, anesthetists, intensive care specialists, and all the allied health professionals who can add their knowledge to the quality of care. From the beginning, they played a major role in caring for socially disadvantaged children. They brought together more than 95% of tertiary care, including cancer care and organ transplantations. They represent the best blend for the study of pediatric medicine and physiology, for high-level preventive medicine, and for research in all fields of pediatrics. This probably explains why they have developed everywhere around the world. This article explains the paramount importance of children's hospitals for providing safe and effective multidisciplinary pediatric care. ",0

882,29874542,Clinical Trial Participants' Views of the Risks and Benefits of Data Sharing,"Background Sharing of participant-level clinical trial data has potential benefits, but concerns about potential harms to research participants have led some pharmaceutical sponsors and investigators to urge caution. Little is known about clinical trial participants' perceptions of the risks of data sharing. Methods We conducted a structured survey of 771 current and recent participants from a diverse sample of clinical trials at three academic medical centers in the United States. Surveys were distributed by mail (350 completed surveys) and in clinic waiting rooms (421 completed surveys) (overall response rate, 79%). Results Less than 8% of respondents felt that the potential negative consequences of data sharing outweighed the benefits. A total of 93% were very or somewhat likely to allow their own data to be shared with university scientists, and 82% were very or somewhat likely to share with scientists in for-profit companies. Willingness to share data did not vary appreciably with the purpose for which the data would be used, with the exception that fewer participants were willing to share their data for use in litigation. The respondents' greatest concerns were that data sharing might make others less willing to enroll in clinical trials (37% very or somewhat concerned), that data would be used for marketing purposes (34%), or that data could be stolen (30%). Less concern was expressed about discrimination (22%) and exploitation of data for profit (20%). Conclusions In our study, few clinical trial participants had strong concerns about the risks of data sharing. Provided that adequate security safeguards were in place, most participants were willing to share their data for a wide range of uses. (Funded by the Greenwall Foundation.).",0
883,21528385,Intrahepatic cholestasis following abuse of powdered kratom (Mitragyna speciosa),"INTRODUCTION: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a common medical plant in Thailand and is known to contain mitragynine as the main alkaloid. According to an increase in published reports and calls at German poison control centers, it has been used more frequently as a drug of abuse in the western hemisphere during the last couple of years. Despite this increase, reports of severe toxicity are rare within the literature. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a young man who presented with jaundice and pruritus after intake of kratom for 2 weeks in the absence of any other causative agent. Alkaloids of M. speciosa were detected in the urine. CONCLUSION: While M. speciosa is gaining in popularity among illicit drug users, its adverse effects remain poorly understood. This is the first published case of intrahepatic cholestasis after kratom abuse.",1

The aim of this study is to investigate the antiandrogen-associated hepatotoxicity in patients with advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: By retrospective charts review, 229 patients (47-89 years old) with advanced prostate cancer treated by total androgen blockade (TAB) with bilateral orchiectomy or LHRH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) analogues plus antiandrogen, or antiandrogen-radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. There were 124 patients taking flutamide 750 mg daily and 105 patients taking cyproterone acetate (CPA) 150 mg daily. Hepatotoxicity defined by the International Consensus Meeting in 1990 and Food and Drug Administration, USA was used to evaluate the hepatotoxicity (including serious hepatotoxicity). RESULTS: There was a higher occurrence of hepatotoxicity in patients taking flutamide (15.3%) than taking CPA (9.5%) (p = 0.034). The occurrence of serious hepatotoxicity of flutamide and CPA was 4.8% (6/124) and 3.8% (4/105), respectively. The mean latency period of hepatotoxicity for CPA was 4.8 +/- 2.0 months for flutamide and 5.8 +/- 1.9 months for CPA, respectively. The 2 groups made no significant difference of liver enzyme (mean maximal alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) = 284.2 +/- 99.3/300.6 +/- 58.5 U/L versus 341.8 +/- 67.1/301.6 +/- 80.5 U/L). All of the 19 patients (100%) and 9 of 10 patients (90%) with flutamide and CPA-induced hepatotoxicity got self-resolution after discontinuation of the antiandrogens. The average time of self-resolution is 4.5 +/- 3.1 months and 6.3 +/- 4.7 months for flutamide and CPA, respectively. Five patients of flutamide-induced and 2 patients of CPA-induced hepatotoxicity got resolution after changing to other antiandrogen. CONCLUSIONS: Flutamide and CPA appear to cause hepatotoxic effects in some patients. Discontinuation of the antiandrogens seems to be the resolution of hepatotoxicity. A change to other antiandrogen may be the alternative strategy to the antiandrogen-induced hepatotoxicity. The results of this study suggest that all patients received flutamide and CPA should be monitored carefully for signs and symptoms referable to hepatic injury to prevent the development of serious hepatic dysfunction.",1
886,787788,Vitamin C and acute illness in Navajo school children,"To evaluate earlier observations, including our own, showing usefulness of vitamin C for managing the common cold, we performed a double-blind trial of vitamin C versus placebo in 868 children. There was no difference in number becoming ill (133 versus 129), number of episodes (166 versus 159) or mean illness duration (5.5 versus 5.8 days) between the groups. Children receiving vitamin C had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus (six versus 13, P less than 0.10), but no difference in overall complicated illness rate (24 versus 25). Plasma ascorbic acid levels were higher in the vitamin group 24 to 26 hours after supplementation (1.28 versus 1.04 mg per 100 ml, P less than 0.01). Children with high plasma ascorbic acid concentrations had longer mean illness (6.8 versus 4.0 days, P less than 0.05) than those with low levels. Vitamin C does not seem to be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent for upper respiratory illness.",0
887,24332567,"Incidence, hospital stay and risk factors associated with the occurrence of pharyngo-cutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy]","Pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) is one of the main problems for patients undergoing total laryngectomy. There are many risk factors described and associated with the appearance of PCF; however, some of these are currently under discussion. The aim of this work is to analyse the incidence of PCF, hospital stay and associated risk factors in patients undergoing total laryngectomy in a secondary hospital. This was an observational study in a retrospective cohort. We included all patients who underwent total laryngectomy between 2006 and 2011. We considered sociodemographic and clinical items, and most of the risk factors studied in the literature by other authors (tracheostomy, tumour stage, chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery, etc.). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS(®) 15.0 and Epidat(®) 3.1. We analysed 70 total laryngectomies. The incidence of PCF in the time period studied was 48.6%. There were significant differences between the mean hospital stay of patients with and without PCF. Affected locoregional lymph nodes were found to be the only risk factor for the occurrence of PCF [RR=1.60 (1.006-2.54)]. The incidence of PCF is associated with the presence of affected locoregional lymph nodes. It is not associated with tracheostomy, administration of radio/chemotherapy before surgery or tumour location. ",0

To identify gender differences, we compared demographics, reasons for attendance, health status, and personal functioning, and drinker characteristics of 174 men and women attending Al-Anon. Men and women were similar in most areas; however, some key differences emerged. Men reported better overall mental health than women, and described some differing concerns and drinker characteristics. With this information, healthcare providers may facilitate men's participation in Al-Anon by addressing their unique concerns and possible barriers to attendance.  ",0
889,7667436,Effects of extraneous stimuli on social cue perception in schizophrenia,"Competing hypotheses that explain the effects of emotionally arousing, extraneous auditory stimuli on the social cue perception of schizophrenic patients were examined in this study: (1) extraneous arousing stimuli enhance patients' cue perception; (2) extraneous stimuli distract patients, and cue perception is diminished. Twenty-five patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia completed a cue-perception task in which half of the videotaped vignettes included in the task were presented with simultaneous extraneous stimuli and half were not. Item difficulty and consistency across extraneous stimuli conditions were matched on standardization and cross-validation samples. Results showed that schizophrenic subjects were significantly more sensitive to cues when exposed to extraneous stimuli, thereby supporting the first hypothesis. This effect was also observed in a subgroup of schizophrenic subjects who demonstrated a distraction decrement on another test of short-term recall. The presence of extraneous stimuli interacted with perception of abstract cues; that is, schizophrenic subjects were particularly better at perceiving abstract cues when extraneous stimuli were presented simultaneously. Future research needs to determine characteristics of extraneous stimuli that enhance cue perception. ",0

METHODS: The Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART)-5 trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, PBO- and active-controlled study in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus (N = 1843; aged 40-65 years) seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms. Subjects received daily oral BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 or 0.625 mg, BZA 20 mg, CE 0.45 mg/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1.5 mg, or PBO. Primary endpoints were incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and percent change in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included additional osteoporosis parameters and assessments of tolerability and safety. RESULTS: At 12 months, endometrial hyperplasia incidence was low (<1%) and similar among groups. The BZA/CE group showed significantly greater increases in lumbar spine and total hip BMD vs decreases with PBO (P < .001); the CE/MPA group had increased lumbar spine BMD compared with that in the BZA/CE group. The BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 and 0.625 mg groups had cumulative amenorrhea rates similar to those with PBO and BZA and significantly higher than those with CE 0.45 mg/MPA 1.5 mg (P < .001). The incidence of breast tenderness with BZA/CE was similar to that with PBO and BZA and significantly lower than with that with CE/MPA (P < .01). Although adverse event (AE) rates were similar among the groups, the incidence of serious AEs overall and AE-related discontinuation rates were higher with CE/MPA than with BZA/CE, BZA, or PBO. CONCLUSIONS: BZA/CE showed low rates of endometrial hyperplasia and improved lumbar spine and total hip BMD and was generally safe and well tolerated.""",1

892,25695024,The accuracy of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for decision making in prostate cancer,"The most important surgical complications of renal transplantation are stenosis and obstruction of anastomosis of the ureter to the bladder. Hence, routine use of ureteral stents to prevent such complications seems logical; however, the optimal time to remove the ureteral stent is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the benefits and complications of the early or delayed ureteral stent removal post-transplantation. All patients who underwent kidney transplantation in Modarres Hospital from May 2011 through March 2012 were recruited. The patients were allocated to three groups. Ureteral stent removed 10, 20, and 30 days after transplantation in groups one, two, and three, respectively. A total of 91 patients had undergone renal transplantation in our center. Ureteral stent was removed at 10, 20, and 30 days after surgery. Urologic complications among the three groups included hydronephrosis, urinoma, and collection around the graft; there was no statistically significant difference among study groups with regard to frequency of complications. We can remove the ureteral stent at shorter interval after renal transplantation with no increased risk of urologic complications. ",0
893,11719360,Thrombocytopenia caused by the development of antibodies to thrombopoietin,"""Thrombocytopenia developed in some individuals treated with a recombinant thrombopoietin (TPO), pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF). Three of the subjects who developed severe thrombocytopenia were analyzed in detail to determine the cause of their thrombocytopenia. Except for easy bruising and heavy menses, none of these subjects had major bleeding episodes; none responded to intravenous immunoglobulin or prednisone. Bone marrow examination revealed a marked reduction in megakaryocytes. All 3 thrombocytopenic subjects had antibody to PEG-rHuMGDF that cross-reacted with endogenous TPO and neutralized its biological activity. All anti-TPO antibodies were immunoglobulin G (IgG), with increased amounts of IgG4; no IgM antibodies to TPO were detected at any time. A quantitative assay for IgG antibody to TPO was developed and showed that the antibody concentration varied inversely with the platelet count. Anti-TPO antibody recognized epitopes located in the first 163 amino acids of TPO and prevented TPO from binding to its receptor. In 2 subjects, endogenous TPO levels were elevated, but the TPO circulated as a biologically inactive immune complex with anti-TPO IgG; the endogenous TPO in these complexes had an apparent molecular weight of 95 000, slightly larger than the full-length recombinant TPO. None of the subjects had atypical HLA or platelet antigens, and the TPO cDNA was normal in both that were sequenced. Treatment of one subject with cyclosporine eliminated the antibody and normalized the platelet count. These data demonstrate a new mechanism for thrombocytopenia in which antibody develops to TPO; because endogenous TPO is produced constitutively, thrombocytopenia ensues.""",1

Bariatric surgical procedures have demonstrated better durable weight loss than diet and exercise; however, risk may limit adoption of these procedures. Endoscopic procedures may offer less risk, lower cost, and satisfactory results, but limited safety and outcome data is available. The present report describes the Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal (POSE(™)) procedure, perioperative care, and 1-year safety and weight loss outcomes for a single center. One hundred forty-seven patients undergoing the POSE procedure between July 2011 and January 2013 were followed for 1 year. Overall patient status and weight data were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcomes included change in total weight loss (TWL), percentage of TWL (%TWL), percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), and adverse events. Patients tolerated the procedure well with no serious short-term or long-term adverse events. All but 1 patient were discharged within 24 hours of the procedure. Baseline body mass index (BMI) was 38.0 ± 4.8 kg/m(2). Initial weight (106.8 ± 18.2 kg) was significantly reduced at 3, 6, and 12 months. At 1 year, 116 patients (79% of total) who were available for follow-up had a mean TWL of 16.6 ± 9.7 kg, %TWL of 15.1 ± 7.8, and %EWL of 44.9 ± 24.4.

895,23653147,Phase I study of pazopanib in patients with advanced solid tumors and hepatic dysfunction: a National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group study,"""PURPOSE: Pazopanib is a potent, multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; however, there is limited information regarding the effects of liver function on pazopanib metabolism and pharmacokinetics. The objective of this study was to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetic profile of pazopanib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with any solid tumors or lymphoma were stratified into four groups based on the degree of hepatic dysfunction according to the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria. Pazopanib was given orally once a day on a 21-day cycle. A modified 3+3 design was used. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled. Patients in the mild group tolerated 800 mg per day. The moderate and severe groups tolerated 200 mg per day. Pharmacokinetic data in the mild group were similar to the data in the normal group. Comparison of the median Cmax and area under the curve [AUC(0-24)] in the moderate or severe groups at 200 mg per day to the values in the normal and mild groups at 800 mg per day indicated less than dose-proportional systemic exposures in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. This suggests that the lower maximum-tolerated dose in the moderate and severe group is not due to a decrease in drug clearance or alteration in the proportion of metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild liver dysfunction, pazopanib is well tolerated at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose of 800 mg per day. Patients with moderate and severe liver dysfunction tolerated 200 mg per day.""",1

897,11520263,Six-year trends in productivity and utilization of 73 clinical laboratories: a College of American Pathologists Laboratory Management Index Program study,"To describe longitudinal trends in the efficiency, labor productivity, and utilization of clinical laboratories in the United States. Financial and activity data were prospectively collected from 73 clinical laboratories continuously enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Laboratory Management Index Program from 1994 through 1999. Each laboratory reported quarterly on its costs, labor inputs, and test activity using uniform data definitions. During the 6-year study period, there was a significant increase in laboratory labor productivity (2.1% more tests/full-time equivalent/y; P <.001). Productivity increases were offset by increasing labor expense (1.5%/full-time equivalent/y; P <.001), consumable expense (1.7%/on-site test/y; P =.005), and blood expense, which comprised more than 10% of laboratory expenses by 1999 (4.4% increase/y; P <.001). As a result, overall expense per test showed no significant change in non-inflation-adjusted dollars. Reference laboratory expense per test did not change significantly during the study period; the proportion of tests sent to reference laboratories grew slightly (0.06% increase/y; P <.001). Test volume of the median laboratory grew by 5442 tests per year (2.3% annual increase; P <.001), while the proportion of testing from inpatients declined by 1.7% per year (P <.001). Inpatient test utilization declined on a discharge basis (annual decline of 1.2 tests/inpatient discharge; P <.001) and on a per diem basis (annual decline of 0.08 tests/inpatient day; P =.002). Inpatient laboratory expense declined on a discharge basis (annual decline of $2.40 or 1.3% per discharge; P <.001), but did not change significantly per inpatient day. Most of the reduction in the expense per discharge occurred during 1994-1996. Between 1994 and 1999, clinical laboratories in the United States experienced significant changes in the cost of operations, utilization, and labor productivity. Laboratory administrators who compare local institutional performance with that of peers are advised to use current or forward-trended peer data. Quarter-to-quarter improvement in many measures of laboratory financial activity may not signal a superior operation, as performance of the whole industry appears to be improving. ",0

899,16513822,Renal function in juvenile rats subjected to prenatal malnutrition and chronic salt overload,"Dietary sodium may contribute to hypertension and to cardiovascular and renal disease if a primary deficiency of the kidney to excrete sodium exists. In order to investigate whether chronic 1% NaCl in the drinking water changes blood pressure and renal haemodynamics in juvenile Wistar rats subjected to prenatal malnutrition, an evaluation of plasma volume, oxidative stress in the kidney, proteinuria and renal haemodynamics was carried out. Malnutrition was induced by a multideficient diet. Mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured using a blood pressure transducer, a flow probe and inulin clearance, respectively. Plasma volume and oxidative stress were measured by means of the Evans Blue method and by monitoring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the kidneys, respectively. Urinary protein was measured by precipitation with 3% sulphosalicylic acid. It was observed that prenatally malnourished rats presented higher values of plasma volume (26%, P < 0.05), kidney TBARS (43%, P < 0.01) and blood pressure (10%, P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. However, they showed no change in renal haemodynamics or proteinuria. Neither prenatally malnourished nor control rats treated with sodium overload presented plasma volume or blood pressure values different from their respective control groups, but both groups presented elevated proteinuria (P < 0.01). The prenatally malnourished group treated with sodium overload presented higher values of kidney TBARS, GFR and filtration fraction (58, 87 and 72% higher, respectively, P < 0.01) than its respective control group. In summary, sodium overload did not exacerbate the hypertension in juvenile prenatally malnourished rats, but induced renal haemodynamic adjustments compatible with the development of renal disease.

900,1357554,A comparison of salmeterol with albuterol in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma,"BACKGROUND: An effective, long-acting bronchodilator could benefit patients with asthma who have symptoms not controlled by antiinflammatory drugs. We compared a new long-acting, inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol, with a short-acting beta 2-agonist, albuterol, in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 234 patients (150 male and 84 female patients 12 to 73 years old) to one of three treatment groups: one group received 42 micrograms of salmeterol twice daily, one received 180 micrograms of albuterol four times daily, and one received placebo. Treatment was assigned in a double-blind fashion, and all patients could use supplemental inhaled albuterol as needed during the 12-week treatment period. RESULTS: Measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second, performed hourly for 12 consecutive hours, showed that a single dose of salmeterol produced a greater mean area under the curve than two doses of albuterol taken 6 hours apart (6.3 vs. 4.9 liter.hr, P < 0.05). The difference was significant on day 1 and at week 4 of the study, but not at week 8 or 12. Salmeterol was also more effective than albuterol or placebo (with albuterol taken as needed) in increasing the morning peak expiratory flow rate: salmeterol induced a mean increase of 24 liters per minute over the pretreatment values, as compared with a decrease of 6 liters per minute with albuterol (P < 0.001) and an increase of 1 liter per minute with placebo (P = 0.002). The mean overall symptom score was improved most by salmeterol treatment (P < 0.05), with the number of days with symptoms and of nights with awakenings decreasing by 22 percent and 52 percent, respectively; there were no differences in results between albuterol treatment and placebo administration. We found no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilating effects of salmeterol, and adverse reactions to all the treatments were infrequent and mild. CONCLUSIONS: For the management of mild-to-moderate asthma, salmeterol given twice daily is superior to albuterol given either four times daily or as needed.",0

All known complications associated to the use of propylthiouracil were considered major adverse reactions, when other causes were discarded. Eight patients (1.4% of the sample) had major adverse reactions: three had agranulocytosis, 3 hepatitis, 1 cholestasis and 1 vasculitis. All had a good evolution after discontinuing the drug. The patients with agranulocytosis were treated with antibiotics and the patient with cholestasis received prednisone.

906,25400109,Weight gain and antipsychotics: a drug safety review,"""INTRODUCTION: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used in several psychiatric disease entities and exert to a different extent a risk for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). As AIWG is associated with an increase in metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular events, knowledge of these risks is crucial for further monitoring and the initiation of counteractive measures. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed and Web of Sciences for randomized-controlled trials and naturalistic observational studies published between 2010 and 2014 with sample sizes exceeding 100, including all marketed SGAs apart from zotepine, and providing data on weight increase. We also summarized relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of head-to-head comparisons. EXPERT OPINION: Recently published data still support the hierarchical ranking of SGAs already proposed in previous reviews ranking clozapine and olanzapine as having the highest risk, followed by amisulpride, asenapine, iloperidone, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone and sertindole in the middle, and aripiprazole, lurasidone and ziprasidone with the lowest risk. Number needed to harm varied considerably in our meta-analysis. Younger patients and patients with a lower baseline body mass index are most vulnerable. The greatest amount of weight gain occurs within the first weeks of treatment. AIWG occurs in all diagnostic groups and is also common in treatment with first-generation antipsychotics; therefore, awareness of this adverse event is essential for anyone prescribing antipsychotics.""",1

Results showed no significant differences across groups for liver function tests, nor were there any significant adverse reactions that could be attributed to kava. No differences in withdrawal or addiction were found between groups. Interesting, kava significantly increased female's sexual drive compared to placebo (p?=?0.040) on a sub-domain of the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), with no negative effects seen in males. Further, it was found that there was a highly significant correlation between ASEX reduction (improved sexual function and performance) and anxiety reduction in the whole sample.""",1
909,28088926,Proxy rated quality of life of care home residents with dementia: a systematic review,"Quality of life (QoL) is an important outcome for people with dementia living in care homes but usually needs to be rated by a proxy. We do not know if relative or paid carer proxy reports differ. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of data investigating whether and how these proxy reports of QoL differ. We searched four databases: Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, and CINAHL in October 2015 with the terms: dementia, QoL, proxy, and care home. Included studies either compared proxy QoL ratings or investigated the factors associated with them. We meta-analyzed data comparing staff and family proxy rated QoL. We included 17/105 papers identified. We found no difference between global proxy ratings of QoL (n = 1,290; pooled effect size 0.06 (95% CI = -0.08 to 0.19)). Studies investigating factors associated with ratings (n = 3,537) found family and staff ratings correlated with the resident's physical and mental health. Staff who were more distressed rated resident QoL lower. Relatives rated it lower when the resident had lived in the care home for longer, when they observed more restraint, or contributed more to fees. Relatives and staff proxy QoL ratings share a clear relationship to resident health and overall ratings were similar. Rater-specific factors were, however, also associated with scores. Understanding why different raters consider the QoL of the same person differently is an important consideration when evaluating the meaning of proxy rated QoL. Proxy raters' backgrounds may affect their rating of QoL. ",0
910,21953144,Myeloid suppressor cells induced by hepatitis C virus suppress T-cell responses through the production of reactive oxygen species,"Impaired T-cell responses in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients have been reported to be associated with the establishment of HCV persistent infection. However, the mechanism for HCV-mediated T-cell dysfunction is yet to be defined. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a pivotal role in suppressing T-cell responses. In this study we examined the accumulation of MDSCs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following HCV infection. We found that CD33(+) mononuclear cells cocultured with HCV-infected hepatocytes, or with HCV core protein, suppress autologous T-cell responses. HCV core-treated CD33(+) cells exhibit a CD14(+) CD11b(+/low) HLADR(-/low) phenotype with up-regulated expression of p47(phox) , a component of the NOX2 complex critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, immunosuppressive factors, arginase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), were not up-regulated. Importantly, treatment with an inactivator of ROS reversed the T-cell suppressive function of HCV-induced MDSCs. Lastly, PBMCs of chronic HCV patients mirror CD33(+) cells following treatment with HCV core where CD33(+) cells are CD14(+) CD11b(+) HLADR(-/low) , and up-regulate the expression of p47(phox). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HCV promotes the accumulation of CD33(+) MDSC, resulting in ROS-mediated suppression of T-cell responsiveness. Thus, the accumulation of MDSCs during HCV infection may facilitate and maintain HCV persistent infection.",0

912,8988885,"A preliminary evaluation of a recombinant circumsporozoite protein vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. RTS,S Malaria Vaccine Evaluation Group","BACKGROUND: The candidate vaccines against malaria are poorly immunogenic and thus have been ineffective in preventing infection. We developed a vaccine based on the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum that incorporates adjuvants selected to enhance the immune response. METHODS: The antigen consists of a hybrid in which the circumsporozoite protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is expressed together with unfused HBsAg. We evaluated three formulations of this antigen in an unblinded trial in 46 subjects who had never been exposed to malaria. RESULTS: Two of the vaccine formulations were highly immunogenic. Four subjects had adverse systemic reactions that may have resulted from the intensity of the immune response after the second dose, which led us to reduce the third dose. Twenty-two vaccinated subjects and six unimmunized controls underwent a challenge consisting of bites from mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum. Malaria developed in all six control subjects, seven of eight subjects who received vaccine 1, and five of seven subjects who received vaccine 2. In contrast, only one of seven subjects who received vaccine 3 became infected (relative risk of infection, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.88; P<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A recombinant vaccine based on fusion of the circumsporozoite protein and HBsAg plus a potent adjuvant can protect against experimental challenge with P. falciparum sporozoites. After additional studies of protective immunity and the vaccination schedule, field trials are indicated for this new vaccine against P. falciparum malaria.",0

However, clinical experience in the paediatric population is still limited. We undertook a multicentre study to analyse the use of linezolid in children. METHODS: Hospitalized children treated with linezolid for a suspected or proven Gram-positive or mycobacterial infection were analysed retrospectively. Side effects were investigated, focusing on younger children and long-term treatments. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (mean age 6.8 years, range 7 days to 17 years) were studied. Mean +/- SD linezolid treatment duration was 26.13 +/- 17 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 74.7% of patients. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhoea and vomiting. Two patients had severe anaemia, two neutropenia and one thrombocytopenia. Two cases of grade 3 liver function test elevation and one case of pancreatitis were reported. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between patients treated for >28 days and those receiving shorter treatments (30.8% versus 28.6%, P = 0.84). Children aged <2 years received linezolid for a shorter duration than older children (21.2 days versus 28.4 days, P = 0.05), whereas the frequency of adverse events was similar in the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our paediatric population, linezolid appeared safe and effective for the treatment of selected Gram-positive and mycobacterial infections. The adverse reactions encountered were reversible and appeared comparable to those reported in paediatric clinical trials. Nevertheless, the potential for haematological toxicity of linezolid in children means that careful monitoring is required during treatment.",1

Since the excess risk of heart disease falls rapidly after the cessation of smoking, we tested the hypothesis that this program was associated with lower rates of death from heart disease. METHODS: Data on per capita cigarette consumption and age-adjusted rates of death from heart disease in California and the United States from 1980 to 1997 were fitted in multiple regression analyses. The regression analyses included the rates in the rest of the United States and variables that allowed for changes in the rates after 1988, when the tobacco-control program was approved, and after 1992, when the program was cut back. RESULTS: Between 1989 and 1992, the rates of decline in per capita cigarette consumption and mortality from heart disease in California, relative to the rest of the United States, were significantly greater than the pre-1989 rates, by 2.72 packs per year per year (P = 0.001) and by 2.93 deaths per year per 100,000 population per year (P<0.001). These rates of decline were reduced (by 2.05 packs per year per year, [P=0.04], and by 1.71 deaths per year per 100,000 population per year, [P=0.031) when the program was cut back, beginning in 1992. Despite these problems, the program was associated with 33,300 fewer deaths from heart disease between 1989 and 1997 than the number that would have been expected if the earlier trend in mortality from heart disease in California relative to the rest of the United States had continued. The diminished effectiveness of the program after 1992 was associated with 8300 more deaths than would have been expected had its initial effectiveness been maintained. CONCLUSIONS: A large and aggressive tobacco-control program is associated with a reduction in deaths from heart disease in the short run.",0
916,15079178,Growth of exclusively breastfed infants in the first 6 months of life],"To evaluate the growth of exclusively breastfed infants from birth to 6 months of life. This was a longitudinal study of 184 children who received primary care at a public institution (Exclusive Breastfeeding Stimulation Program, PROAME) in Belém, state of Pará, Brazil, between February 2000 and January 2001. A total of 102 children completed the study. All were born at full term with a birth weight greater than or equal to 2,500 g. No events were recorded during the neonatal period and the infants were exclusively breastfed, on demand, since their birth. The infants were followed up monthly, and the weight and length measured at birth and at the end of the first, fourth and sixth months of life were compared to the 50th percentile line of the NCHS growth charts and to other previous studies of Brazilian children who were exclusively breastfed. Growth was adequate for all the children, who doubled their weight before the fourth month of life. Despite a slow-down in weight and height gain after the fourth month, the weight averages at 6 months were greater than the standards used for comparison. The average weight of these exclusively breastfed children was above the 50th percentile of the NCHS curve at 6 months, thus confirming the nutritional advantages of breast milk, especially when the mothers receive guidance regarding the appropriate techniques for breastfeeding.

917,8510687,Educational status and active life expectancy among older blacks and whites,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Persons of low socioeconomic status are known to have reduced life expectancy. In a study of the relation of socioeconomic status to disability-free or active life expectancy among older persons, we analyzed prospectively gathered data on 2219 blacks and 1838 whites who were 65 years of age or older in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. We defined disability as the inability to perform independently one or more basic functional activities such as walking, bathing, dressing, eating, and using the toilet. For subgroups defined by sex, race, and education, statistical models were used to estimate, for persons at each year of age, the probability of transition from not being disabled or being disabled at base line to not being disabled, being disabled, or having died one year later. These transition probabilities were then entered into increment-decrement life tables to generate estimates of total, active, and disabled life expectancy (with total life expectancy equal to active life expectancy plus disabled life expectancy). RESULTS: Sixty-five-year-old black men had a lower total life expectancy (11.4 years) and active life expectancy (10 years) than white men (total life expectancy, 12.6 years; active life expectancy, 11.2 years), although the differences were reduced after we controlled for education. The estimates for 65-year-old black women (total life expectancy, 18.7 years; active life expectancy, 15.9 years) were similar to those for white women. Black men and women 75 years old and older had higher values for total life expectancy and active life expectancy than whites, and the differences were larger after stratification for education. Education had a substantially stronger relation to total life expectancy and active life expectancy than did race. At the age of 65, those with 12 or more years of education had an active life expectancy that was 2.4 to 3.9 years longer than the values for those with less education in all the four subgroups defined by sex and race. Overall, the subgroups with longer total life expectancy and active life expectancy also lived more years with a disability. CONCLUSIONS: Among older blacks and whites, the level of education, a measure of socioeconomic status, has a greater effect than race on total life expectancy and active life expectancy.",0
918,27773786,Monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with eosinophilic inflammation,"""Eosinophils have been linked with asthma for more than a century, but their role has been unclear. This review discusses the roles of eosinophils in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and describes therapeutic antibodies that affect eosinophilia. The aims of pharmacologic treatments for pulmonary conditions are to reduce symptoms, slow decline or improve lung function, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are important in managing symptoms and exacerbations in asthma and COPD. However, control with these agents is often suboptimal, especially for patients with severe disease. Recently, new biologics that target eosinophilic inflammation, used as adjunctive therapy to corticosteroids, have proven beneficial and support a pivotal role for eosinophils in the pathology of asthma. Nucala� (mepolizumab; anti-interleukin [IL]-5) and Cinquair� (reslizumab; anti-IL-5), the second and third biologics approved, respectively, for the treatment of asthma, exemplifies these new treatment options. Emerging evidence suggests that eosinophils may contribute to exacerbations and possibly to lung function decline for a subset of patients with COPD. Here we describe the pharmacology of therapeutic antibodies inhibiting IL-5 or targeting the IL-5 receptor, as well as other cytokines contributing to eosinophilic inflammation. We discuss their roles as adjuncts to conventional therapeutic approaches, especially ICS therapy, when disease is suboptimally controlled. These agents have achieved a place in the therapeutic armamentarium for asthma and COPD and will deepen our understanding of the pathogenic role of eosinophils.""",1
919,19839005,The heat shock protein inhibitor Quercetin attenuates hepatitis C virus production,"The hepatitis C viral (HCV) genome is translated through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) as a single polyprotein precursor that is subsequently cleaved into individual mature viral proteins. Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is one of these proteins that has been implicated in regulation of viral genome replication, translation from the viral IRES and viral packaging. We sought to identify cellular proteins that interact with NS5A and determine whether these interactions may play a role in viral production. Mass spectrometric analysis of coimmunoprecipitated NS5A complexes from cell extracts identified heat shock proteins (HSPs) 40 and 70. We confirmed an NS5A/HSP interaction by confocal microscopy demonstrating colocalization of NS5A with HSP40 and with HSP70. Western analysis of coimmunoprecipitated NS5A complexes further confirmed interaction of HSP40 and HSP70 with NS5A. A transient transfection, luciferase-based, tissue culture IRES assay demonstrated NS5A augmentation of HCV IRES-mediated translation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HSP70 reduced this augmentation. Treatment with an inhibitor of HSP synthesis, Quercetin, markedly reduced baseline IRES activity and its augmentation by NS5A. HSP70 knockdown also modestly reduced viral protein accumulation, whereas HSP40 and HSP70 knockdown both reduced infectious viral particle production in an HCV cell culture system using the J6/JFH virus fused to the Renilla luciferase reporter. Treatment with Quercetin reduced infectious particle production at nontoxic concentrations. The marked inhibition of virus production by Quercetin may partially be related to reduction of HSP40 and HSP70 and their potential involvement in IRES translation, as well as viral morphogenesis or secretion. CONCLUSION: Quercetin may allow for dissection of the viral life cycle and has potential therapeutic use to reduce virus production with low associated toxicity.",0
920,26547109,"Brodalumab, a human anti-interleukin-17-receptor antibody in the treatment of Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: Efficacy and safety results from a phase II randomized controlled study","BACKGROUND: Brodalumab (KHK4827 or AMG 827) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the human interleukin (IL)-17 receptor A and blocks the biological activities of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F, and IL-17E also known as IL-25. A 12-week phase 2 trial in the USA, Europe, and other countries showed the good efficacy of brodalumab in treating patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. However, with the exception of a phase 1 study, a clinical trial of brodalumab in psoriasis has not been undertaken in Japan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brodalumab in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, including psoriatic arthritis, in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative phase 2 study, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of brodalumab. METHODS: Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, including psoriatic arthritis, were randomized to receive 70mg, 140mg, or 210mg of brodalumab, or placebo, injected subcutaneously at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients with ?75% reduction of PASI scores (PASI 75), ?90% (PASI 90), and 100% (PASI 100) and the percentage of patients with a static physician's global assessment (sPGA) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at week 12. Safety was evaluated by assessing the adverse events (AE) and the patients' hematologic and laboratory values. RESULTS: At week 12, the mean percentage improvements in the PASI scores were 37.7%, 82.2%, 96.8%, and 9.4% in the 70mg, 140mg, 210mg, and placebo groups, respectively, (p<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). The percentage of patients with PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 at week 12 were 7.9%, 2.6%, and 0%, respectively, in the placebo group, 25.6%, 15.4%, and 2.6%, respectively, in the 70mg brodalumab group, 78.4%, 64.9%, and 35.1%, respectively, in the 140mg brodalumab group, and 94.6%, 91.9%, and 59.5%, respectively, in the 210mg brodalumab group. Concerning psoriatic arthritis, at week 12, the numbers (%) of patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology response criteria for a 20% improvement were 0 (0%) in the placebo group, and 1 (20%), 2 (40%), and 4 (100%) in the 70mg, 140mg, and 210mg brodalumab groups, respectively. The percentages of patients with Dermatology Life Quality Index scores of 0 or 1 at week 12 were greater in the 140mg (54.1%) and the 210mg (56.8%) brodalumab groups than in the placebo group (8.8%). The most common AE in the brodalumab groups were nasopharyngitis (12.4% vs. 7.9% for placebo), diarrhea (5.3% vs. 0%), upper respiratory tract inflammation (3.5% vs. 0%), and folliculitis (3.5% vs. 0%). CONCLUSION: The rapid, robust efficacy of brodalumab and its favorable safety profile shown in the current study confirm previous studies conducted in Caucasian people, further warranting the use of brodalumab as a new treatment option for plaque psoriasis.",1

922,31400959,Electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hindpaw hypersensitivity in colitis rats by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia,"Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently complain of pain in body regions somatotopically distinct from the gut, suggesting the involvement of an exaggerated signaling process in both visceral and somatic sensory pathways. Increasing evidence has shown that sprouting of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers toward sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia maintains and exacerbates the neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as colonic inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether electroacupuncture could alleviate the visceral and secondary somatic hyperalgesia in colitis rats by suppressing the TH-IR expression in related dorsal root ganglia. After trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid irritation, rats developed inflammatory tissue damage in the distal colon, which was accompanied by visceral hypersensitivity and secondary hind paw hyperalgesia, as indicated by enhanced visceromotor response to colorectal distension and decreased mechanical and thermal withdrawal latency of the hind paw. Additionally, excessive TH-IR fibers sprouted toward calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive sensory neurons, and TH-IR neurons also increased in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia of colitis rats. Both electroacupuncture and guanethidine attenuated visceral and referred hind paw hyperalgesia by inhibiting the over-expression of TH-IR neurons and fibers in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia. Moreover local inflammatory damage in the distal colon was restored after 7 days of electroacupuncture intervention. These results suggest that electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hind paw hypersensitivity in colitis rats by inhibiting TH expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia. ",0

Previous experience with hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy has shown that patient tolerability and treatment efficacy described in controlled clinical trials did not necessarily mirror the """"real world"""" experience. The goal of this study was to define SVR rates in a """"real world"""" analysis and to explore predictors of treatment response with SMV and SOF. METHODS: This is a retrospective study examining the """"real world"""" treatment of 170 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 using the combination of SMV and SOF with or without ribavirin (RBV) for a fixed 12-week duration irrespective of prior interferon therapy, transplant status or fibrosis stage. Differences between SVR cohorts were analyzed by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol. RESULTS: The vast majority of patients were genotype 1a, 77% were cirrhotic in the non-LT group, and 35% of the entire cohort was African-American. Combination treatment with SMV and SOF in genotype 1 chronic HCV patients achieved an overall SVR rate at 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12) of 78% by ITT and 86% by per protocol (84% in non-liver transplant (LT) patients and 89% in post-LT recipients). The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be a significant negative predictor of SVR12, whereas an undetectable week eight VL was a significant positive predictor of SVR in the entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm excellent SVR outcomes with favorable safety and tolerability profiles in patients who carry many traditional high-risk features for non-response, including post-LT recipients and patients with advanced liver disease.""",1

Nine of the recipients were undergoing retransplantation. The over-all kidney survival rate to date has been 77.6 per cent, and 78.8 per cent of the recipients are dialysis-free. The patient mortality in this learning phase was 13.3 per cent. Nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and other side-effects of cyclosporin A could usually be dealt with by dosage adjustments, making feasible the chronic use of this agent. One B-cell immunoblastic sarcoma was encountered which was monoclonal. It was not responsible for death. Another patient had a perforation of the intestine from a lympho-proliferative reaction in which the B cells were polyclonal. After jejunal resection a year ago, there were no further complications. This lesion was not classified as a lymphoma. Both lympho-proliferative lesions were associated with a rise in antibody to viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus. Results of this study have verified the effectiveness and relative safety of cyclosporin A with steroids for immunosuppression in human recipients of cadaveric kidneys.",1
926,16501005,Effect of CYP3A5 polymorphism on tacrolimus metabolic clearance in vitro,"Previous investigations of solid organ transplant patients treated with tacrolimus showed that individuals carrying a CYP3A5*1 allele have lower dose-adjusted trough blood concentrations compared with homozygous CYP3A5*3 individuals. The objective of this investigation was to quantify the contribution of CYP3A5 to the hepatic and renal metabolic clearance of tacrolimus. Four primary tacrolimus metabolites, 13-O-desmethyl tacrolimus (13-DMT) (major), 15-O-desmethyl tacrolimus, 31-O-desmethyl tacrolimus (31-DMT), and 12-hydroxy tacrolimus (12-HT), were generated by human liver microsomes and heterologously expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The unbound tacrolimus concentration was low (4-15%) under all incubation conditions. For CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, V(max) was 8.0 and 17.0 nmol/min/nmol enzyme and K(m,u) was 0.21 and 0.21 muM, respectively. The intrinsic clearance of CYP3A5 was twice that of CYP3A4. The formation rates of 13-DMT, 31-DMT, and 12-HT were >or=1.7-fold higher, on average, in human liver microsomes with a CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype compared with those with a homozygous CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype. Tacrolimus disappearance clearances were 15.9 +/- 9.8 ml/min/mg protein and 6.1 +/- 3.6 ml/min/mg protein, respectively, for the two genotypes. In vitro to in vivo scaling using both liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes yielded higher predicted in vivo tacrolimus clearances for patients with a CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype compared with those with a CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype. In addition, formation of 13-DMT was 13.5-fold higher in human kidney microsomes with a CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype compared with those with a CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype. These data suggest that CYP3A5 contributes significantly to the metabolic clearance of tacrolimus in the liver and kidney. ",0
927,19085956,"Mesenchymal origin of hepatic stellate cells, submesothelial cells, and perivascular mesenchymal cells during mouse liver development","The knowledge concerning fetal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is scarce, and their cell lineage and functions are largely unknown. The current study isolated fetal liver mesenchymal cells from a mouse expressing beta-galactosidase under the control of Msx2 promoter by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and surveyed marker genes by microarray analysis. Based on the location and immunostaining with conventional and newly disclosed markers, we have identified three distinct populations of fetal liver mesenchymal cells expressing both desmin and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR): HSCs in the liver parenchyma; perivascular mesenchymal cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA); and submesothelial cells associated with the basal lamina beneath mesothelial cells and expressing activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha. A transitional cell type from the submesothelial cell phenotype to fetal HSCs was also identified near the liver surface. Mesothelial cells expressed podoplanin and ALCAM. Ki-67 staining showed that proliferative activity of the submesothelial cells is higher than that of mesothelial cells and transitional cells. Using anti-ALCAM antibodies, submesothelial and mesothelial cells were isolated by FACS. The ALCAM(+) cells expressed hepatocyte growth factor and pleiotrophin. In culture, the ALCAM(+) cells rapidly acquired myofibroblastic morphology and alpha-SMA expression. The ALCAM(+) cells formed intracellular lipid droplets when embedded in collagen gel and treated with retinol, suggesting the potential for ALCAM(+) cells to differentiate to HSCs. Finally, we demonstrated that fetal HSCs, submesothelial cells, and perivascular mesenchymal cells are all derived from mesoderm by using MesP1-Cre and ROSA26 reporter mice. CONCLUSION: Fetal HSCs, submesothelial cells, and perivascular mesenchymal cells are mesodermal in origin, and ALCAM(+) submesothelial cells may be a precursor for HSCs in developing liver.",0

A structure unique to the skin of monotremes is the push rod-a compacted column of epidermal cells that is 20 microns wide and 100 microns long with its tip at the skin surface, and that is able to move relatively independently of adjacent tissue. At the base of each push rod is a cluster of encapsulated nerve endings. Push rods are common in skin of the snout and have been postulated to have a mechanosensory function. Experiments were carried out on four anesthetized echidnas with the aim of determining the function of push rods. Recordings made from the infraorbital nerve, which supplies the skin of the upper jaw, yielded responses from a total of 46 afferents. Two were electroreceptors; the others were mechanoreceptors. Within the group of mechanoreceptors with rapidly adapting responses, three responded to high-frequency vibration and resembled pacinian corpuscles. There were 26 slowly adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors, which, based on the regularity of their discharge, could be divided into two groups: SA I or Merkel type, and SA II or Ruffini type. SA I receptors had very discrete receptive fields with diameters of 100 microns. The receptive fields of two SA I receptors were marked, and after histological processing, one was seen to lie near two push rods. It is concluded that mechanoreceptor responses in the echidna's snout skin resemble those in other mammals in many aspects. We could not unequivocally associate responses to mechanical stimulation with the push rods. ",0
930,14727939,Cilostazol: a review of its use in intermittent claudication,"Cilostazol (Pletal) is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-III with antiplatelet, antithrombotic and vasodilating properties. It also exhibits antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and has beneficial effects on high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12- to 24-week trials in >2000 patients with moderate to severe intermittent claudication demonstrated that cilostazol generally significantly increased walking distances and improved quality of life compared with placebo. Additionally, a large comparative 24-week trial showed that cilostazol 100 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than pentoxifylline 400mg three times daily (pentoxifylline was not significantly different from placebo). Cilostazol was generally well tolerated. Adverse events reported significantly more often with cilostazol than with placebo included headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, infection, rhinitis and peripheral edema and in comparison with pentoxifylline were headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools and palpitations. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity, transient or resolved after symptomatic treatment and rarely required treatment withdrawal. Significant drug interactions are observed when cilostazol is coadministered with other agents that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g. erythromycin or diltiazem) or CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole). As a result, in Europe cilostazol is contraindicated in patients receiving CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors and in the US it is recommended that dosage reduction for cilostazol be considered during coadministration of cilostazol and CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors. Conversely, cilostazol itself does not appear to inhibit CYP3A4. Coadministration of cilostazol with aspirin or warfarin did not result in any clinically significant changes to coagulation parameters, bleeding time or platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION: In six of eight well designed clinical trials, cilostazol was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing walking distances and improving the quality of life of patients with moderate to severe intermittent claudication. In addition, limited comparative data have shown that cilostazol has superior efficacy compared with pentoxifylline. Cilostazol is also generally well tolerated. Additional comparative trials are required to confirm these results, to determine the place of cilostazol in relation to other agents or exercise therapy and risk factor reduction alone, and to establish the effects of long-term treatment with cilostazol in patients with intermittent claudication. Cilostazol is contraindicated in several subpopulations of patients, particularly those with congestive heart failure and severe hepatic or renal impairment. Nonetheless, current data support the choice of cilostazol as a promising therapy amongst the limited options available for patients with intermittent claudication.",1

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients treated for LTBI by INH (1993-2002) or RIF (2004-2007) based on a database including age, gender, prior liver diseases, alcohol consumption, completion rates, time and cause of interruption and monthly analysis of ASAT and ALAT. RESULTS: 624 subjects were included, 426 treated by INH and 198 by RIF. Gender, origin, history of prior hepatic disease and alcohol excess did not differ between groups. Treatment interruption because of hepatotoxicity was significantly higher in the INH group than in the RIF group (6.1% vs 2.0%; p = 0.03). Completion of treatment was significantly higher in the RIF group compared to the INH group (83% vs 74%; p = 0.02).

932,23633924,Inauhzin sensitizes p53-dependent cytotoxicity and tumor suppression of chemotherapeutic agents,"Toxicity and chemoresistance are two major issues to hamper the success of current standard tumor chemotherapy. Combined therapy of agents with different mechanisms of action is a feasible and effective means to minimize the side effects and avoid the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs while improving the antitumor effects. As the most essential tumor suppressor, p53 or its pathway has been an attractive target to develop a new type of molecule-targeting anticancer therapy. Recently, we identified a small molecule, Inauhzin (INZ), which can specifically activate p53 by inducing its deacetylation. In this study, we tested if combination with INZ could sensitize tumor cells to the current chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin (CIS) and doxorubicin (DOX). We found that compared with any single treatment, combination of lower doses of INZ and CIS or DOX significantly promoted apoptosis and cell growth inhibition in human non-small lung cancer and colon cancer cell lines in a p53-dependent fashion. This cooperative effect between INZ and CIS on tumor suppression was also confirmed in a xenograft tumor model. Therefore, this study suggests that specifically targeting the p53 pathway could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and markedly reduce the doses of the chemotherapy, possibly decreasing its adverse side effects.

934,20032006,Hepatic safety profile of raltegravir in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C,"""BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection experience antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity more frequently than HIV mono-infected persons. Herein, we report the hepatic safety profile of raltegravir in a relatively large group of HIV/HCV co-infected patients, a population that was poorly represented in the registrational studies. METHODS: Prospective, observational study of all antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients who initiated raltegravir from January 2006 to January 2009 at a reference HIV clinic. Clinical data, laboratory parameters and liver stiffness measured at baseline, week 4 and every 3 months thereafter were collected. Chronic hepatitis C was defined as positive serum HCV-RNA. Grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity was defined following the AIDS Clinical Trials Group definition for liver enzyme elevations (LEEs). A control group of patients who initiated protease inhibitors (PIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was examined similarly. RESULTS: Data from 218 HIV-infected patients on raltegravir were analysed, 126 HIV mono-infected and 92 HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Any degree of LEEs occurred in 10 (7.9%) HIV mono-infected and 23 (25%) co-infected patients (relative risk 3.1; 95% confidence interval 2.9-3.4; P = 0.002). Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3-4), however, was only seen in 3 (1.4%) patients, all co-infected with HCV. It occurred at months 1, 15 and 15, respectively. In all three subjects other reasons than raltegravir exposure most likely explained LEEs. Multivariate analysis revealed HCV co-infection as the only independent variable associated with any degree of hepatotoxicity on raltegravir (P = 0.03). Finally, the rate of LEEs in patients on raltegravir was lower than in those who were treated with PIs or NNRTIs. CONCLUSIONS: LEEs are less frequent in patients treated with raltegravir than with other antiretroviral drug classes. However, HIV/HCV co-infected patients treated with raltegravir experienced LEEs more frequently than HIV mono-infected persons.

935,16410201,Riluzole therapy for motor neurone disease: an early Australian experience (1996-2002),"""Riluzole is the only therapy proven in clinical trials to prolong survival in patients with motor neurone disease (MND). Prior to its listing by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Scheme in June 2003, the aim of the present study was to provide Australian patients with MND early access to riluzole and to expand the safety profile data of this therapy. Patients with MND were referred to the programme by neurologists covering the Sydney metropolitan region. To be eligible to receive riluzole, patients had to be aged between 18 and 75 years and have probable or definite MND based on El Escorial criteria, with a disease duration of less than 5 years and a vital capacity greater than 60% before study entry. Patients were prescribed riluzole 50 mg twice daily. Safety data were collected through documentation of adverse events by clinical history in combination with regular laboratory screening. Full blood count, haematocrit, differential white cell counts and serum liver transaminase levels were obtained monthly for 3 months, and then at each 3-monthly visit for 1 year. In total, 25 patients with MND (17 male, 8 female; age range 40-74 years; mean age 59 years) were commenced on riluzole. Of these, 28% had definite MND and the remaining 72% were diagnosed as probable MND, with the majority (84%) having limb-onset MND. At 12 months, 68% of patients continued on riluzole, 16% had died from their disease and 16% ceased riluzole because of side-effects or other reasons, largely disenchantment owing to a perceived lack of efficacy. Haematological and biochemical assays showed no significant alteration during the initial 12-month period. Long-term survival data for patients in the present series suggest a greater benefit for patients who commenced riluzole early in the course of their illness. In conclusion, riluzole was generally tolerated well by Australian patients with MND. Of the few patients who experienced side-effects attributed to riluzole, all were reversible. Issues related to patient perceptions of efficacy highlight the need for patients and treating physicians to maintain realistic expectations of riluzole therapy.""",1
936,7354778,Small-airways dysfunction in nonsmokers chronically exposed to tobacco smoke,"We evaluated the effect of long-term passive smoking (involuntary inhalation of tobacco smoke by nonsmokers) and long-term voluntary smoking on specific indexes of pulmonary function in 2100 middle-aged subjects. Regardless of sex, nonsmokers chronically exposed to tobacco smoke had a lower forced mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF 25 to 75 per cent) and forced end-expiratory flow rate (FEF 75 to 85 per cent) than nonsmokers not exposed (P less than 0.005). In addition, values in passive smokers were not significantly different from those in light smokers and smokers who did not inhale (P less than 0.005). When we looked at the extent to which smoke exposure is related to graded abnormality, we found that nonsmokers in smoke-free working environments have the highest scores on the spirometric tests; passive smokers, smokers who do not inhale, and light smokers score similarly and significantly lower; and heavy smokers score the lowest (P less than 0.005). We conclude that chronic exposure to tobacco smoke in the work environment is deleterious to the nonsmoker and significantly reduces small-airways function.",0
937,19487945,Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: a prognostic and therapeutic study,"""OBJECTIVES: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare and serious complication of biguanide treatment. It usually occurs when a precipitating disease induces an acute renal failure and an incidental overdose. Voluntary intoxication is rare. Bicarbonate hemodialysis (HD) is recommended to decrease metformin levels and correct acidosis but its optimal duration has not been determined. This study was designed to document the characteristics and prognostic factors of intentional and incidental metformin overdose and to determine the optimal duration of HD. DESIGN: Ten years retrospective analysis of patients admitted in intensive care unit for metformin-associated lactic acidosis. SETTING: Two intensive care units (50 beds) in a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and biological characteristics, organ failures, and sequential metformin levels during HD were recorded. Forty-two patients were included (13 voluntary intoxications and 29 incidental overdoses); 74% of patients were in acute renal failure and needed HD. No death was observed in intentional overdose patients compared with 48.3% mortality in incidental overdose patients. The factors significantly associated with mortality were logistic organ dysfunction system score, pH, plasma lactate, and prothrombin activity. By multivariate analysis, a prothrombin activity <50% was the only independent predictive factor of mortality (relative risk: 59.8; confidence limits: 6.3-568; p < 0.0001). Sequential measurements of metformin levels during HD were consistent with a bicompartmental elimination pattern. A cumulative HD duration of 15 hours was associated with the return of metformin level to the therapeutic normal range. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the outcome of MALA was uniformly favorable after intentional metformin overdose. The vital prognosis was mainly influenced by the occurrence of multiple organ dysfunctions, the best predictive factor of death being an acute liver dysfunction as assessed by PT activity. Prolonged HD was needed to correct metformin overdose.""",1

An example of the approach is presented using data on beef herds in Wyoming, USA. The approach uses past covariate information (serum-neutralization titres collected on animals in 16 herds) within a predictive model for classification of a future observable herd. Simulations to estimate misclassification probabilities for different misclassification costs and prevalences of infected herds can be used as a guide to the sample size needed for classification of a future herd.

Hepatitis B virus DNA sequences were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 115 (44.4%) of the chronic HBsAg carriers and from two (12%) of the anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. In anti-hepatitis delta-negative patients, viral DNA was positive in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 74 (46%) and from 24 (35.5%) with and without serum HBV-DNA, respectively. With respect to anti-hepatitis delta-positive patients, viral DNA was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in 8 of 13 (61.5%) of the patients with circulating hepatitis delta virus RNA and in 9 of 17 (53%) of the hepatitis delta virus RNA-negative subjects. Regarding hepatitis B virus DNA in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell, 71% (5 of 7) of the patients with serum hepatitis B virus DNA had this marker in peripheral blood mononuclear cell, whereas 52% (12 of 23) of the patients without serum hepatitis B virus DNA had hepatitis B virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell. A Southern blot analysis was also carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 30 patients. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 16 patients as free forms, in 12 patients as dimers and free forms and as free circular together with free linear forms in the remaining two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
942,29893661,Individuals seeking gender reassignment: marked increase in demand for services,"Aims and methodTo describe the pattern of referrals and characteristics of people aged over 18 seeking gender reassignment in Oxfordshire over a 6-year period (2011-2016). A total of 153 individuals attended for assessment (of 162 referred); 97 (63.4%) were natal males and 56 (36.6%) were natal females. Mean age at referral was markedly different between the two groups, with females being younger. The number of referral significantly increased over the time period, by an average of 18% per year (95% CI 1.08-1.30). Eighty-seven patients sought transition from male to female, and 46 from female to male, while a smaller group (n = 13) had non-binary presentations. Twelve patients (7.8%) had autism spectrum disorder.Clinical implicationsThere are various possible reasons for the increased demand for services for people with gender dysphoria, which we discuss here. When planning services in the UK, both the increase in overall referral rates and the apparent earlier age at referral should be taken into account.Declaration of interestNone. ",0

All 11 infected persons had recently eaten cooked crabs from five widely separated sites in the coastal marsh, and a matched-triplet case-control study showed a significant relation between cholera and eating such crabs (P = 0.007). V. cholerae O1 was isolated from estuarine water, from fresh shrimp, from a leftover cooked crab from a patient's refrigerator, and from sewage in six towns, including three without identified cases. All isolates in Louisiana and an isolate from a single unexplained case in Texas in 1973 were biotype El Tor and serotype inaba; they were hemolytic and of a phage type unique to the United States--suggesting that the organism persisted undetected along the Gulf Coast for at least five years.",0

Baseline venous plasma alpha-hANP was 27.3 +/- 16.5 pg/ml in the controls (mean +/- SD; N = 6), 141.6 +/- 138.0 pg/ml in patients 1 to 6 (P less than 0.05 compared to controls), and 167.5 +/- 145.7 pg/ml in patients 7 to 14. Total body alpha-hANP production rate was markedly elevated in patients 1 to 6 compared to controls (0.45 +/- 0.36 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/min, P less than 0.05) and was similar to that determined by the continuous infusion technique in patients 7 to 14 (0.62 +/- 0.44 micrograms/min, P = 0.49 compared to patients 1 to 6). alpha-hANP release into the right heart (0.17 +/- 0.11 micrograms/min), however, was significantly lower than total body production rate in the cardiac dysfunction patients, indicating that total body alpha-hANP secretion occurs from sites in addition to drainage into the right heart via the coronary sinus and anterior cardiac veins. Right atrial pressure correlated with the alpha-hANP released into the right heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0
945,21843083,Neem leaf glycoprotein inhibits CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs to restrict murine tumor growth,"The presence of Tregs in tumors is associated with compromised tumor-specific immune responses and has a clear negative impact on survival of cancer patients. Thus, downregulation of Tregs is considered as a promising cancer immunotherapeutic approach. We have reported previously that neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP) prophylaxis restricts tumor growth in mice by immune activation. In continuation, here, involvement of NLGP in the modulation of Tregs in association with tumor growth restriction is investigated. NLGP downregulates CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs within tumors. NLGP-mediated downregulation of CCR4 along with its ligand CCL22 restricts Treg migration at the tumor site. NLGP is not apoptotic to Tregs but significantly downregulates the expression of Foxp3, CTLA4 and GITR. It also reverses the functional impairment of T-effector cells by Tregs, in terms of IFN-γ secretion, cellular proliferation and tumor cell cytotoxicity. NLGP also facilitates reconditioning of tumor microenvironment (hostile) by increasing IFN-γ and IL-12 but decreasing IL-10, TGF-β, VEGF and IDO, creating an antitumor niche. Interaction between Foxp3, p-NFATc3 and p-Smad2/3, needed for successful Treg function, is also inhibited by NLGP. All of these coordinated events might result in inhibition of Treg associated-tumor growth and therefore increased survivability of mice having NLGP treatment before or/and after tumor inoculation. Thus, the possibility of NLGP being an excellent tool as a T-cell anergy breaker by abrogating the suppressor functions of Tregs in cancer needs to be explored further in the clinic. ",0
946,6183586,5-azacytidine selectively increases gamma-globin synthesis in a patient with beta+ thalassemia,"5-Azacytidine is a cytidine analogue that is capable of activating repressed genes in tissue-culture cells and has been shown to increase hemoglobin-F production in anemic baboons. This drug was administered to a patient with severe beta-thalassemia in an attempt to stimulate hemoglobin-F production. After seven days of 5-azacytidine treatment, gamma-globin synthesis increased approximately sevenfold, temporarily normalizing the patient's unbalanced globin synthesis. Erythropoiesis became more effective, leading to a temporary increase in the absolute reticulocyte count (from 5000 to 22,000 per cubic millimeter) and in hemoglobin concentration (from 8.0 to 10.8 g per deciliter). Hypomethylation of bone-marrow DNA near both the gamma-globin and epsilon-globin genes was directly demonstrated. At the time of peak drug effect, about 7000 gamma-globin messenger RNA molecules were present per erythroid bone-marrow cell, in contrast to 10 to 15 epsilon-globin messenger RNA molecules per cell. 5-Azacytidine selectivity increases gamma-globin synthesis and therefore provides a new approach to the treatment of severe beta-thalassemia. Further studies will be required to evaluate the efficacy, risks, and long-term toxicity of 5-azacytidine (or related compounds) before this approach can be used as a therapy for patients with disorders of hemoglobin synthesis.",0

An initiative of the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) Prevention Committee. Regression techniques were used to derive regional and global estimates of TSCI incidence. Using the findings of 31 published studies, a regression model was fitted using a known number of TSCI cases as the dependent variable and the population at risk as the single independent variable. In the process of deriving TSCI incidence, an alternative TSCI model was specified in an attempt to arrive at an optimal way of estimating the global incidence of TSCI. The global incidence of TSCI was estimated to be 23 cases per 1,000,000 persons in 2007 (179,312 cases per annum). World Health Organization's regional results are provided. Understanding the incidence of TSCI is important for health service planning and for the determination of injury prevention priorities. In the absence of high-quality epidemiological studies of TSCI in each country, the estimation of TSCI obtained through population modelling can be used to overcome known deficits in global spinal cord injury (SCI) data. The incidence of TSCI is context specific, and an alternative regression model demonstrated how TSCI incidence estimates could be improved with additional data. The results highlight the need for data standardisation and comprehensive reporting of national level TSCI data. A step-wise approach from the collation of conventional epidemiological data through to population modelling is suggested. ",0
949,7813599,Endocrine characterization of the new dopamine autoreceptor agonist roxindole,"Roxindole (5-Hydroxy-3-(4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridil-(1)-butyl)-indol) is a newly developed compound with a high dopamine autoreceptor agonistic potency at D2 receptors. Evaluation of roxindole for clinical purposes in psychiatric patients revealed that the substance has contrary to expectation merely negligible antipsychotic but considerable antidepressive effects. Interestingly it is nearly devoid of any side effects. To further characterize the endocrine effects, 1 mg roxindole was applied at 09:00 to 6 male volunteers and the effects compared to placebo. From 08:00 to 13:00 blood samples were drawn every 30 min. No effect on adrenocorticotropin and cortisol secretion was observed, neither mean plasma concentrations nor area values differed significantly. 90 min after roxindole administration an enhanced release of growth hormone could be observed, comparison of mean hormonal concentration revealed statistical significance (p < 0.05). Also the area values differed significantly (roxindole vs. placebo mean +/- SD 18.1 +/- 17.1 vs. 7.7 +/- 8.0 micrograms x h/l; p < 0.05). After roxindole also a pronounced reduction of prolactin plasma levels from 5.3 +/- 1.4 micrograms/l to 1.1 +/- 0.4 microgram/l within 150 min could be observed. Mean plasma concentrations (p < 0.05) and area values differed significantly (roxindole vs. placebo mean +/- SD 14.8 +/- 13.5 vs. 34.4 +/- 18.1; p < 0.05). Roxindole had no effect on blood pressure parameters and heart rate. The major findings of the present exploratory study are, that roxindole has potent effects on the facilitation of growth hormone secretion and the inhibition of prolactin release. Both findings are complementary and point also to interesting postsynaptic dopamine receptor agonistic effects. ",0

We evaluated the safety of nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected pregnant women. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 23 pregnancies managed with nevirapine-based regimens from July 2001 to April 2005. The incidence of adverse events was determined and analyzed by CD4+ cell count of either less than or greater than or equal to 250 cells/microL, and gestational age when nevirapine was initiated. Liver function abnormality was graded according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS toxicity guidelines. RESULTS: Five of 23 patients (21.7%) started nevirapine-based therapy after 27 weeks of gestation. All 3 cases of adverse events occurred in this group within 6 weeks of initiating therapy and with CD4+ cell count greater than 250 cells/microL. A significant difference was noted in the proportion of patients who developed toxicity while starting nevirapine in the third trimester (3/5, 60%; 95% confidence interval 14.66-94.73) compared with those starting nevirapine earlier in pregnancy (0/18, 0%; 95% confidence interval 0.0-18.53; P < .006). Two patients developed rash, eosinophilia, and liver function abnormality, with one developing clinical hepatitis and renal failure. A third patient had abnormal elevation of liver enzymes but was asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: The incidence of adverse events with nevirapine may be lower than previously reported (13% versus 29%) and may be primarily noted with initiating the drug late in pregnancy. Further study of nevirapine in larger cohorts of HIV-infected pregnant women is warranted to determine the relationship between nevirapine hepatotoxicity and trimester use.

We aimed to clarify the functions and mechanisms of dysregulated circRNAs in the cells and EVs of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). CircRNA microarray was used to identify circRNA expression profiles in CCA tissues and bile-derived EVs. Cholangiocarcinoma-associated circular RNA 1 (circ-CCAC1) expression was measured by qRT-PCR. The clinical importance of circ-CCAC1 was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier plots, and Cox regression model. The functions of circ-CCAC1 and exosomal circ-CCAC1 were explored in CCA cells and HUVECs, respectively. Different animal models were used to verify the in vitro results. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pulldown, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, and luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the regulatory networks of circ-CCAC1 in CCA cells and HUVECs. Circ-CCAC1 levels were increased in cancerous bile-resident EVs and tissues. The diagnostic and prognostic values of circ-CCAC1 were identified in patients with CCA. For CCA cells, circ-CCAC1 increased cell progression by sponging miR-514a-5p to upregulate YY1. Meanwhile, YY1 directly bound to the promoter of CAMLG to activate its transcription. Moreover, circ-CCAC1 from CCA-derived EVs was transferred to endothelial monolayer cells, disrupting endothelial barrier integrity and inducing angiogenesis. Mechanistically, circ-CCAC1 increased cell leakiness by sequestering EZH2 in the cytoplasm, thus elevating SH3GL2 expression to reduce the levels of intercellular junction proteins. In vivo studies further showed that increased circ-CCAC1 levels in circulating EVs and cells accelerated both CCA tumorigenesis and metastasis. CONCLUSION: Circ-CCAC1 plays a vital role in CCA tumorigenesis and metastasis and may be an important biomarker/therapeutic target for CCA.",0

956,8040106,Hepatic side-effects of antibiotics,"Although the liver is particularly exposed to drugs and their metabolites, hepatic side-effects of antibiotics are far less frequent than other adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or cutaneous reactions. However, the potential severity of hepatic side-effects for some drugs is stressed. Antibiotic related liver injuries cover most of the clinical and pathological expressions of hepatic dysfunction, including cytotoxic hepatitis (isoniazid), intrahepatic cholestasis (macrolides, penicillins, clavulanic acid), mixed hepatitis (sulphonamides), chronic active hepatitis (nitrofurantoin), or microvesicular steatosis (tetracycline). In most cases, toxicity is idiosyncratic, reactions occurring only in some susceptible individuals. The mechanisms underlying toxicity may be primarily metabolite-dependent (isoniazid), hypersensitivity-mediated (beta-lactams), or result from both processes (sulphonamides, erythromycin derivatives). In some cases, the liver is not the primary target organ for toxicity but appears to mediate the clinical expression of some adverse effects induced by antibiotics. The most significant example of this is hypoprothrombinaemia due to the inhibition of hepatic gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by sulphydryl group-containing cephalosporins. Inhibition of bilirubin conjugation or transport by rifampicin or fusidic acid may also be viewed as hepatic side-effects of antibiotics. Ascertaining the casual relationship of a given drug to an hepatic adverse effect may prove particularly difficult, because of the potential contribution of host status and concurrent medications. Diagnosis is based mainly on circumstantial evidence, i.e. the temporal relationship between drug administration (or withdrawal) and the time-course of liver dysfunction. Improving morbidity related to drug hepatotoxicity relies on a free flow of information between manufacturers and practitioners in order to optimize detection of potentially serious liver damage, and advances in pharmacogenetics toward a better identification of those at particular risk for developing drug-related liver toxicity.",1
957,3086940,Glutathione peroxidase is neither required nor kinetically competent for conversion of 5-HPETE to 5-HETE in rat PMN lysates,"In the 5-lipoxygenase pathway for arachidonic acid metabolism, reduction of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) is catalyzed by an activity different from glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidase here refers to the nonspecific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction by glutathione of cumene hydroperoxide and a variety of other peroxides including 5-HPETE. This enzyme is inhibited by mercaptosuccinic acid. Preparations of the 15,000xg supernatant from lysed rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes were the source of these activities. Thus, when glutathione peroxidase is inhibited to less than 0.5% of its normal activity by mercaptosuccinic acid, 5-HPETE is reduced as efficiently as in the absence of mercaptosuccinate. In lysate preparations from which endogenous glutathione has been removed, reduction of 5-HPETE is still observed but only in the presence of added reducing agents, e.g., 0.2 mM glutathione. When endogenous glutathione peroxidase is not inhibited, reduction of 5-HPETE occurs at a rate greater than 15-fold faster than can be accounted for by this activity. We conclude, therefore, that the glutathione peroxidase in rat PMNs is not kinetically competent to account for reduction of 5-HPETE. There is a distinct peroxidase that catalyzes this reaction. The 5-HPETE peroxidase can utilize glutathione as reducing agent but is not inhibited by mercaptosuccinate, and additional results indicate that it is inactivated during turnover. ",0

Risk of death from spontaneous abortion was over 50 times greater for women who continued their pregnancy with a device in place than for those who did not. The Dalkon shield carried an increased risk of death, as compared to other devices, even after rates were adjusted for duration of use. However, pregnant women with either a loop or a coil in place also had a higher risk of dying from spontaneous abortion than those without any device. The results support the clinical recommendation that any device should be removed when pregnancy is first diagnosed.",0

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were grafted onto activated graphene oxide (GO), and the surfaces of the obtained magnetic GO-g-CNC particles were molecularly imprinted with polymers using ofloxacin (OFX) as a template molecule and methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer. The resulting Mag@GO-g-CNCs@MIP material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under optimum adsorption conditions, the Mag@GO-g-CNCs@MIPs with large specific surface area were easily collected and separated using an external magnetic field. Mag@GO-g-CNCs@MIPs exhibited an ultra-fast adsorption profile for FQs (5 min to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity of 74 mg/g), with imprinting factor values ranging from 1.5 to 3.1. High recognition selectivity towards nine FQs from real river water samples was established through coupling with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the recovery of samples spiked with nine FQs was found to be in the range of 79.2-96.1%, with a detection limit ranging from 6.5 to 51 ng/g. Moreover, the data obtained adhered to the Freundlich isotherm model, and the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model. Finally, the Mag@GO-g-CNCs@MIPs could be regenerated and reused for seven consecutive cycles with only a 13% drop in adsorption capacity, indicating its effective application as a new, reusable, and selective adsorbent for the enrichment and separation of FQs from aqueous solutions.

961,25408528,Molecular aspects of anti-atherosclerotic effects of short peptides,"We studied molecular mechanisms of the vasoprotective effects of tripeptide T-38 and dipeptide RR-1. Short peptides T-38 and the RR-1 activate the processes of cell renewal in organotypic and dissociated cultures of vascular cells during aging by increasing the expression of Ki-67 and reducing the synthesis of p53 protein. T-38 and RR-1 reduce the synthesis of E-selectin, adhesion molecule involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.  ",0
962,1619683,Dietary fat and postmenopausal breast cancer,"Although the results of animal studies and cross-cultural comparisons generally support a role for dietary fat in the etiology of breast cancer, results of analytic epidemiology studies are equivocal. The association between dietary fat and subsequent breast cancer was examined in a cohort of 34,388 postmenopausal women from Iowa. Dietary habits were assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire mailed in January 1986. Through December 31, 1989, 459 incident cases of breast cancer occurred in this cohort. Proportional hazards regression was used to examine the dietary fat-breast cancer association while adjusting for potential confounders. The effects on this association of four analytic approaches to adjustment for energy intake were also considered. After adjustment for known determinants of breast cancer, a modest positive association of total fat intake with risk of breast cancer was seen. Polyunsaturated fat intake was also positively associated with breast cancer (relative risk from lowest to highest intake, 1.0, 1.25, 1.31, and 1.49; P for trend = .052). Different approaches to adjustment for energy intake, however, provided different impressions of the dietary fat-breast cancer association. One method, involving categorization of crude fat intake and inclusion of total energy intake in regression analysis, gave relative risk estimates from low to high fat intake of 1.0, 1.17, 1.25, and 1.38 (P for trend = .18). Another method, based on categorization of fat intake residuals in which the variation in fat due to total energy intake was removed, gave corresponding estimates of 1.0, 1.24, 1.30, and 1.16 (P for trend = .29). The former suggests increasing breast cancer risk with increasing fat intake; the latter suggests no association. These results are consistent with other cohort studies that have shown a weak association or no association between dietary fat and breast cancer. They are also consistent with studies suggesting that fat intake is a determinant of breast cancer, particularly after accounting for inaccuracies in dietary assessment. The effects of different energy-adjustment methods may account in part for the varying interpretations of four previous cohort studies of dietary fat and breast cancer. Further work is needed to clarify not only the nature of the dietary fat-breast cancer association, but also the impact of different analytic methods used in the investigation of diet-disease associations.

Therefore, the radiolabeling of benzylpenicillin with lutetium-177 is expected to serve as a theranostic agent for deep-seated bacterial infections. The radiolabeling of benzylpenicillin resulted ~93% radiochemical yield at optimized reaction conditions. Radiochemical purity analysis was tested with the help of Whatman No. 2 paper and instant thin layer chromatography. Biodistribution study with healthy New Zeeland white rabbit revealed moderate accumulation in different organs. Kidneys are the major organs, showed not more than 4.57±0.89% injected dose per gram organ (ID/gm organ) at 1 h time point and 3.48±1.11% ID/gm organ at 6 h time point. The accumulation of tracer agent in liver was found in the range of 7.42±2.42% to 9.09±2.76 ID/gm organ.

965,24193402,Clinical features and prognostic factors in severe cutaneous drug reactions,"""BACKGROUND: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). SJS and TEN (SJS/TEN) and DRESS are thought to be different diseases; however, they share some clinical and laboratory features. Although SCORTEN serves as an excellent prognostic marker for SJS/TEN, there is still a need for development of other prognostic markers for SCARs. METHODS: The study population consisted of 88 SCAR patients. Clinical characteristics and clinical manifestations were compared between SJS/TEN and DRESS. Risk factor analyses for prolonged hospitalization were performed. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 41 were SJS/TEN and 47 were DRESS. Mortality rates of TEN and DRESS were 9.8 and 2.1%, respectively. Allopurinol and carbamazepine were the most common causes of both SJS/TEN and DRESS (34.7 and 62.9%, respectively). Some of the systemic presentations, such as fever and laboratory abnormalities were common in both phenotypes. Thrombocytopenia tended to be related to prolonged hospitalization (longer than 3 weeks) in SJS/TEN (odds ratio, OR = 5.1, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.8-31.8, p = 0.076). In DRESS patients, leukocytosis at presentation (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.1-20.3, p = 0.03) was related to prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features of SCARs in a tertiary hospital in Korea were similar to those reported previously. SJS/TEN and DRESS shared some clinical and laboratory features. Thrombocytopenia for SJS/TEN and leukocytosis at presentation for DRESS may be useful prognostic markers for prolonged hospitalization.""",1
966,10220271,"Safety issues of plateletpheresis: comparison of the effects of two cell separators on the activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and neutrophils and on the formation of neutrophil-platelet aggregates","Although many donors undergo repeated plateletpheresis, data on the consequences of plateletpheresis for the donor's health remain scarce. Thus, the effect of plateletpheresis on the activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and neutrophils was investigated. Part 1: Sixteen healthy men were randomly assigned to undergo plateletpheresis on a cell separator (AMICUS, Fenwal Baxter; or MCS 3p, Haemonetics). The effects of plateletpheresis on plasma levels of prothrombin fragment (F(1+2)), D-dimer, plasmin-plasmin inhibitor (PPI) complexes, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1); on the activation of neutrophils (% L-selectin+); and on the frequency of platelet-neutrophil aggregates (% CD41+ neutrophils) were compared. Part 2: Ten healthy men received infusions of ACD-A and placebo without apheresis in a randomized, double-blind crossover study to control for the pharmacologic effects of citrate. Part 1: No change in F(1+2) occurred (p>0.05), which indicated that plateletpheresis did not enhance coagulation. Levels of D-dimer, PPI, and PAI-1 decreased over time on the AMICUS (p<0.001). Plateletpheresis did not activate neutrophils (p>0.05), but it decreased the percentage of CD41+ neutrophils (p<0.003). An approximately 80-percent drop in mononuclear cells was observed in the extracorporeal circulation of the AMICUS (p<0.001 vs. baseline and p = 0.005 vs. MCS 3p), and circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts decreased concomitantly. Part 2: Infusion of ACD-A slightly decreased D-dimer levels (p<0.05), and both infusions decreased the circulating lymphocyte counts. Plateletpheresis can be regarded as safe with respect to the activation of coagulation or neutrophils. The consequences for the donor's health of the decrease in D-dimer, PPI, and PAI-1 may deserve further investigation. ",0
967,11514133,Perceptions of the real and the ideal ward atmosphere among trainees and staff before and after the introduction of a new work rehabilitation model,"Changes in the ward atmosphere of a psychiatric work rehabilitation unit were investigated. Both trainees and staff filled in the Community-Oriented Programs Environment Scale (COPES) before and after a new rehabilitation model was implemented. It was hypothesised that the levels of autonomy and practical orientation would increase from both the trainees' and staff's perspective concerning the real ward atmosphere and that the staff's perceptions of an ideal ward atmosphere would change in the same way. The staff perceived an increased level of autonomy with respect to both the real ward atmosphere and to what constitutes an ideal ward atmosphere, which partly confirmed the hypotheses, but the level of practical orientation was stable. Concerning the staff's estimate of an ideal ward atmosphere, further changes were an increased level of involvement and a decrease in spontaneity, which was not hypothesised, but was not in conflict with the philosophy behind the new model. From the trainee's perspective there was no change of either autonomy or practical orientation. Instead, there was a decrease in personal problem orientation. Compared to an optimal profile, the ward atmosphere was beneficial, before as well as after implementation of the new programme. Differences were found between the staff and the trainees, but they were not large enough to separate the groups according to what is considered an optimal profile. The few changes found support earlier conclusions that the ward atmosphere is a stable phenomenon over time. ",0

972,28088167,"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a novel dual-action oral topical formulation against upper respiratory infections","Current prevention options for upper respiratory infections (URIs) are not optimal. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMS-I™ (currently marketed as Halo™) in the prevention of URIs. ARMS-I is patented novel formulation for the prevention and treatment of influenza, comprising a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC) and components (glycerin and xanthan gum) that form a barrier on the host mucosa, thus preventing viral contact and invasion. Healthy adults (18-45 years of age) were randomized into ARMS-I or placebo group (50 subjects each). The drug was sprayed intra-orally (3× daily) for 75 days. The primary objectives were to establish whether ARMS-I decreased the frequency, severity or duration of URIs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, rate of virus detection, acceptability and adherence; effect on URI-associated absenteeism and medical visits; and effect of prior influenza vaccination on study outcomes. Of the 94 individuals who completed the study (placebo: n = 44, ARMS-I: n = 50), six presented with confirmed URI (placebo: 4, ARMS-I: 2), representing a 55% relative reduction, albeit this was statistically not significant). Influenza, coronavirus or rhinovirus were detected in three participants; all in the placebo group. Moreover, frequency of post-treatment exit visits was reduced by 55% in ARMS-I compared to the placebo group (N = 4 and 2, respectively). Fever was reported only in the placebo group. ARMS-I significantly reduced the frequency and severity of cough and sore throat, and duration of cough (P ≤ .019 for all comparisons). ARMS-I was safe, well tolerated, had high acceptability and high adherence to medication use. Medical visits occurred only in the placebo group while absenteeism did not differ between the two arms. Prior influenza vaccination had no effect on study outcome. This randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial demonstrated that ARMS-I tended to provide protection against URIs in the enrolled study participants, while reducing severity and duration of cough and sore throat. A clinical trial with a larger number of study participants is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02644135 (retrospectively registered). ",0
973,7854377,A prospective evaluation of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme gene polymorphism and the risk of ischemic heart disease,"BACKGROUND: In a previous study, men with a history of myocardial infarction were found to have an increased prevalence of homozygosity for the deletional allele (D) of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) gene. The D allele is associated with higher levels of ACE, which may predispose a person to ischemic heart disease. We investigated the association between the ACE genotype and the incidence of myocardial infarction, as well as other manifestations of ischemic heart disease, in a large, prospective cohort of U.S. male physicians. METHODS: In the Physicians' Health Study, ischemic heart disease as defined by angina, coronary revascularization, or myocardial infarction developed in 1250 men by 1992. They were matched with 2340 controls according to age and smoking history. Zygosity for the deletion-insertion (D-I) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed for both matched pairs and unmatched samples, with adjustment for the effects of known or suspected risk factors by conditional and nonconditional logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: The ACE genotype was not associated with the occurrence of either ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction. The adjusted relative risk associated with the D allele was 1.07 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.19; P = 0.24) for ischemic heart disease and 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.25; P = 0.56) for myocardial infarction, if an additive mode of inheritance is assumed. Additional analyses assuming dominant and recessive effects of the D allele also failed to show any association, as did the examination of low-risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, prospectively followed population of U.S. male physicians, the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene conferred no appreciable increase in the risk of ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction.",0
974,30754321,First Report of Postharvest Fruit Rot in Persimmon Caused by Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis in Italy,"Persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) is widely grown in Italy, the leading producer in Europe. In the fall of 2009, a previously unknown rot was observed on 3% of fruit stored at temperatures between 5 and 15°C in Torino Province (northern Italy). The decayed area was elliptical, firm, and appeared light brown to dark olive-green. It was surrounded by a soft margin. The internal decayed area appeared rotten, brown, and surrounded by bleached tissue. On the decayed tissue, black pycnidia that were partially immersed and up to 0.5 mm in diameter were observed. Light gray conidia produced in the pycnidia were unicellular, ovoid or lacriform, and measured 3.9 to 6.7 × 2.3 to 3.5 (average 5.0 × 2.9) μm. Fragments (approximately 2 mm) were taken from the margin of the internal diseased tissues, cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at temperatures between 23 and 26°C under alternating light and darkness. Colonies of the fungus initially appeared ash colored and then turned to dark greenish gray. After 14 days of growth, pycnidia and conidia similar to those described on fruit were produced. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using the primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 502-bp segment showed a 100% similarity with the sequence of Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis Xiao & J.D. Rogers (GenBank Accession No. AY608648). The nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. GU949537. Pathogenicity tests were performed by inoculating three persimmon fruits after surface disinfesting in 1% sodium hypochlorite and wounding. Mycelial disks (10 mm in diameter), obtained from PDA cultures of one strain were placed on wounds. Three control fruits were inoculated with plain PDA. Fruits were incubated at 10 ± 1°C. The first symptoms developed 6 days after the artificial inoculation. After 15 days, the rot was very evident and P. washingtonensis was consistently reisolated. Noninoculated fruit remained healthy. The pathogenicity test was performed twice. Since P. washingtonensis was first identified in the United States on decayed apples (2), 'Fuji', 'Gala', 'Golden Delicious', 'Granny Smith', 'Red Chief', and 'Stark Delicious', apple fruits also were artificially inoculated with a conidial suspension (1 × 10 ",0
975,7923316,Alpha 1-blockade for the treatment of hypertension: a megastudy of terazosin in 2214 clinical practice settings,"""The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the alpha 1-blocking agent terazosin on blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids in a large, variant population of patients with hypertension. A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",1
976,22610658,Impact of disease severity on healthcare costs in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increases total healthcare costs but the effect of the severity of liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) on healthcare costs has not been well studied. We analyzed the demographics, healthcare utilization, and healthcare costs of CHC patients in a large U.S. private insurance database (January, 2002 to August, 2010), with at least 1 year of baseline enrollment and 30 days of continuous follow-up. Patients were stratified by liver disease severity: noncirrhotic liver disease (NCD), compensated cirrhosis (CC), and endstage liver disease (ESLD), as defined by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes. Mean all-cause and HCV-related healthcare costs per-patient-per-month (PPPM) during follow-up (mean 634 days) are reported in 2010 U.S.$ from the payer's perspective. A total of 53,796 patients with CHC were included (NCD: 41,858 [78%]; CC: 3,718 [7%]; and ESLD: 8,220 [15%]). Mean all-cause PPPM healthcare costs were 32% and 247% higher for patients with CC and ESLD compared to those with NCD ($1,870 and $4,931 versus $1,420; P < 0.001) and were independent of age or comorbid conditions. Pharmacy, ambulatory, and inpatient care collectively accounted for 90% of NCD costs and 93% of CC and ESLD costs. The largest cost components were inpatient costs for those with ESLD (56%) and ambulatory costs for those with CC and NCD (37% and 36%, respectively). Overall, 56% of costs were HCV-related and this proportion increased with severity (46%, 57%, and 71% for patients with NCD, CC, and ESLD, respectively). CONCLUSION: The direct healthcare costs associated with CHC are high, increase in association with the progression of liver disease, and are highest in those with ESLD.",0

Moreover, in academic medical centers there is competition for scarce resources, including patients and support for residents. Analysis of the number of physicians in practice as well as in training shows clearly that both internists and family physicians, as well as pediatricians and obstetricians, must participate in rendering primary care if the needs for this type of physician are to be met. Internal medicine also has to achieve a better balance between generalists and subspecialists, and family practice must define its limitations, monitor its rapid growth and assure the quality of its training programs.

979,29385364,History of Childhood Kidney Disease and Risk of Adult End-Stage Renal Disease,"BACKGROUND: The long-term risk associated with childhood kidney disease that had not progressed to chronic kidney disease in childhood is unclear. We aimed to estimate the risk of future end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among adolescents who had normal renal function and a history of childhood kidney disease. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, historical cohort study of 1,521,501 Israeli adolescents who were examined before compulsory military service in 1967 through 1997; data were linked to the Israeli ESRD registry. Kidney diseases in childhood included congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, pyelonephritis, and glomerular disease; all participants included in the primary analysis had normal renal function and no hypertension in adolescence. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio for ESRD associated with a history of childhood kidney disease. RESULTS: During 30 years of follow-up, ESRD developed in 2490 persons. A history of any childhood kidney disease was associated with a hazard ratio for ESRD of 4.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.52 to 4.99). The associations between each diagnosis of kidney disease in childhood (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, pyelonephritis, and glomerular disease) and the risk of ESRD in adulthood were similar in magnitude (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 5.19 [95% CI, 3.41 to 7.90], 4.03 [95% CI, 3.16 to 5.14], and 3.85 [95% CI, 2.77 to 5.36], respectively). A history of kidney disease in childhood was associated with younger age at the onset of ESRD (hazard ratio for ESRD among adults <40 years of age, 10.40 [95% CI, 7.96 to 13.59]). CONCLUSIONS: A history of clinically evident kidney disease in childhood, even if renal function was apparently normal in adolescence, was associated with a significantly increased risk of ESRD, which suggests that kidney injury or structural abnormality in childhood has long-term consequences.",0
980,3724804,Familial dependence of the resting metabolic rate,"Human obesity is known to be a familial disorder. We studied 130 nondiabetic adult southwestern American Indians (74 men and 56 women) from 54 families to determine whether the resting metabolic rate, as measured by indirect calorimetry, is a familial trait that is independent of individual differences in fat-free mass (estimated mass of metabolically active tissue), age, and sex. We found that most of the variance in the resting metabolic rate (83 percent, P less than 0.0001) was accounted for by three covariates--fat-free mass, age, and sex--and that fat-free mass was the most important determinant. Family membership accounted for an additional 11 percent (P less than 0.0001) of the variance in the resting metabolic rate. Thus, resting metabolic rate is a familial trait in this population, and it is independent of differences in fat-free mass, age, and sex. We also found that persons from families with lower resting metabolic rates were no more obese than persons from families with higher metabolic rates. This finding may be partly explained by the close correlation between fat-free mass and percentage of body fat (r = 0.81, P less than 0.0001), which indicates that the resting metabolic rate, as adjusted for fat-free mass, is already partly adjusted for obesity. Only prospective studies will elucidate whether the familial dependence of the resting metabolic rate is a contributing mechanism to the familial predisposition to obesity.",0
981,11584382,Woodchuck hepatocytes remain permissive for hepadnavirus infection and mouse liver repopulation after cryopreservation,"Isolated hepatocytes represent a relevant model of the liver and are highly required both for research and therapeutic applications. However, sources of primary liver cells from human beings and from some animal species are limited. Therefore, cryopreservation of hepatocytes could greatly facilitate advances in various research areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cryopreserved primary woodchuck hepatocytes could be used for woodchuck hepatitis B virus (WHV) infection studies, and whether they could maintain their regenerative potential in vivo after thawing. Critical steps for good quality of cryopreserved hepatocytes included the use of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution as a main component of the freezing medium, stepwise reduction of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to avoid osmotic shock, and maintenance of low concentrations of DMSO in the culture medium. After cryopreservation, cell viability was still high (70% to 80%), and 50% to 60% of thawed cells attached to the plates. The appearance of covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA and of WHV-replicative forms a few days after in vitro infection demonstrated that thawed woodchuck hepatocytes were still susceptible to viral infection, thus proving maintenance of a very high hepatocyte-specific differentiation status. Furthermore, transplantation of woodchuck hepatocytes into the liver of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/recombination activation gene-2 (RAG-2) mice, a model of liver regeneration, demonstrated that cryopreserved cells retained the ability to divide and to extensively repopulate a xenogenic liver. Notably, in vivo susceptibility to infection with WHV and proliferative capacity of frozen/thawed woodchuck hepatocytes in recipient mice were identical to those observed by transplanting fresh hepatocytes.",0

983,24326033,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety and efficacy of febuxostat versus allopurinol in chronic gout,"""OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for the treatment of chronic gout. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that compared oral febuxostat to oral allopurinol for treatment of chronic gout. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated with random effects and were reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: From 1076 potentially relevant citations, 7 studies and 25 associated publications met inclusion criteria; 5 studies were ultimately included in the analysis. Febuxostat did not reduce the risk of gout flares compared with allopurinol (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.30, I(2) = 44%). Overall, the risk of any adverse event was lower in febuxostat recipients compared to allopurinol (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.99, I(2) = 13%). Patients receiving febuxostat were more likely to achieve a serum uric acid of <6 mg/dl than allopurinol recipients (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.22-2.00, I(2) = 92%). Subgroup analysis did not indicate any significant difference between high- and low-dose febuxostat on the risk of gout flares. CONCLUSION: Although febuxostat was associated with higher likelihood of achieving a target serum uric acid level of <6 mg/dl, there was significant heterogeneity in the pooled results. There was no evidence that febuxostat is superior to allopurinol for clinically relevant outcomes. Given its higher cost, febuxostat should not be routinely used for chronic gout.""",1

Laboratory findings included elevated bilirubin, grossly elevated transaminases and prolonged prothrombin time. Radiological investigation showed no evidence of extra-hepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral hepatitis and autoimmune disease. The patient may have been previously sensitized by exposure to isoflurane 3 years previously but antibodies to tri-fluoro acetate, present in 70% of cases of halothane hepatitis, were not detected in pre-operative or postoperative samples of blood. On the seventh postoperative day the patient died and postmortem examination demonstrated centrilobular necrosis of the liver, with a histological pattern similar to changes associated with halothane hepatitis.",1
985,3812421,Propylthiouracil-induced fatal hepatic necrosis,"We present a fatal case of acute submassive hepatic necrosis occurring in a 42-yr-old black woman treated for hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil for 1 yr. Alcohol and drug abuse were ruled out and all serological tests for hepatitis A and B, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus infection were negative. At autopsy the liver was shrunken and presented a yellow granular appearance. Microscopy disclosed submassive necrosis with bile stasis and severe chronic inflammation, as well as mild bile duct proliferation. Although non-A, non-B hepatitis cannot be ruled out (there was no transfusion of blood or its products), this is considered to be the third fatal case and ninth instance of propylthiouracil-induced hepatic necrosis.",1
986,24329704,Effect of an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase 7-nitroindazole on cerebral hemodynamic response and brain excitability in urethane-anesthetized rats,"The role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and seizures remains disputable. One of the reasons why results from the acute in vivo studies display controversies might be the effect on the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during pharmacologically induced alterations of NO system. We examined neurovascular coupling in the rat sensorimotor cortex in response to transcallosal stimulation under nNOS inhibition by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI). Adult Wistar rats were anesthetized with urethane and epidural silver EEG electrodes were implanted over sensorimotor cortices. Regional CBF was measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). We catheterized a common carotid artery to measure arterial blood pressure (BP). 7-NI did not significantly affect blood pressure and heart rate. Electrophysiological recordings of evoked potentials (EPs) revealed no effect on their amplitude, rhythmic potentiation or depression of EPs. Transcallosal stimulation of the contralateral cortex induced a frequency dependent rise in CBF. Although 7-NI did not significantly affect basal CBF and cortical excitability, hemodynamic responses to the transcallosal stimulation were diminished implicating a role of nNOS in neurovascular coupling. Urethane anesthesia is suitable for future epileptological experiments. Our findings demonstrate that NO contributes to the hemodynamic response during brain activation.  ",0
987,26723501,Efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy in germline BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with advanced ovarian cancer and three or more lines of prior therapy,"""OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of olaparib, an oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, was investigated in a subgroup of patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutated (gBRCA1/2m) advanced ovarian cancer who had received ?3 prior lines of chemotherapy. Primary data from this Phase II study (Study 42, ClinicalTrials.govNCT01078662) have been reported previously. METHODS: Eligible patients were treated with oral olaparib 400mg bid capsule monotherapy until disease progression according to RECIST v1.1. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) were assessed for patients with measurable disease at baseline. Safety and tolerability were assessed for all patients by adverse event (AE) incidence and changes in laboratory parameters. Platinum resistance status was obtained retrospectively, and responses to olaparib evaluated. RESULTS: In patients with gBRCA1/2m ovarian cancer, 154/193 (80%) had received ?3 prior lines of chemotherapy, of whom 137/154 (89%) had measurable disease at baseline. ORR was 34% (46/137; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26-42) and median DoR was 7.9 (95% CI 5.6-9.6) months. ORR in platinum-resistant tumors was 30%. Median DoR for platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease was similar: 8.2months (95% CI 5.6-13.5) compared with 8.0months (4.8-14.8), respectively. Six of the 193 (3%) patients had an AE with an outcome of death. None of these AEs at time of occurrence was considered causally related to olaparib. CONCLUSION: Following ?3 prior lines of chemotherapy, olaparib 400mg bid (capsule form) monotherapy demonstrated notable antitumor activity in patients with gBRCA1/2m advanced ovarian cancer. No new safety signals were identified.""",1

989,17261402,"Safety of lovastatin/extended release niacin compared with lovastatin alone, atorvastatin alone, pravastatin alone, and simvastatin alone (from the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system)","Recent national guidelines support combination drug therapy targeting multiple lipid abnormalities. Current drug labeling warns of an increased risk of adverse events with statin and niacin combinations. These recommendations have been based solely on case reports. We compared the rates of adverse event reports (AERs) received by the United States Food and Drug Administration (1999 to March 2005) associated with the combination of lovastatin/niacin-extended release (ER) with those of lovastatin or niacin-ER alone, and other commonly used statins. The following AERs were considered: events that were fatal, life-threatening, or resulted in hospitalization (serious AERs), hepatotoxicity (liver AERs), and rhabdomyolysis (rhabdomyolysis AERs). We also calculated the prevalence of concomitant niacin-ER therapy in statin-associated AERs. The rate of serious AERs associated with the combination lovastatin/niacin-ER was similar to that of lovastatin or niacin-ER alone, and significantly less than that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. Likewise, the rates of liver and rhabdomyolysis AERs associated with lovastatin/niacin-ER were similar to those of the other statins or niacin-ER alone and lower than those of simvastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis reports (p <0.01). Concomitant niacin-ER use in statin-associated AERs was rare (<or=1%). In conclusion, these findings do not support a clinically significant adverse drug interaction between niacin-ER and statins and should encourage the safe use of this combination in appropriate high-risk patients, as recommended by the national guidelines.",1

A widespread assumption for chimpanzee tool-use cultures is that they, too, are dependent on social learning. However, we provide evidence to suggest that individual learning, rather than social learning, is the driver behind determining the form of these behaviours within and across individuals. Low-fidelity social learning instead merely facilitates the reinnovation of these behaviours, and thus helps homogenise the behaviour across chimpanzees, creating the population-wide patterns observed in the wild (what here we call """"socially mediated serial reinnovations""""). This is the main prediction of the Zone of Latent Solutions (ZLS) hypothesis. This study directly tested the ZLS hypothesis on algae scooping, a wild chimpanzee tool-use behaviour.

991,26292191,Relationships between serum asunaprevir concentration and alanine aminotransferase elevation during daclatasvir plus asunaprevir for chronic HCV genotype 1b infection,"Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations were the most frequent adverse events during all-oral combinations with daclatasvir and asunaprevir for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the underline mechanisms are unclear. Seventy patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection, who were introduced daclatasvir 60?mg once daily plus asunaprevir 100?mg twice daily for 24 weeks, were measured serum asunaprevir concentrations at the one point or more of 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the start of treatment. In 4 and 8 weeks after the start of treatment, asunaprevir concentrations in patients with albumin levels <3.6?g/dl at baseline were significantly higher than those in patients with albumin levels ?3.6?g/dl. The baseline factors did not affect to ALT severe elevations (?300 IU/l). At 2 weeks after the start of treatment, ALT severe elevations with asunaprevir concentrations of ?800?ng/ml (54.5%) tended to indicate the higher rates than those of <800?ng/ml (17.6%). Furthermore, the discontinuation or reduction of asunaprevir improved ALT levels, regardless the significant decrease of serum asunaprevir concentrations. In conclusion, serum albumin levels affected to serum asunaprevir concentrations, and serum asunaprevir concentrations might partly affect to ALT severe elevations. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to investigate the impact of the discontinuation or reduction of asunaprevir to help in the design of more effective therapeutic regimens.",1

There is controversy over whether androgen replacement is a risk factor for incident prostate cancer. Our review of current clinical information revealed that to date, no study or review has definitively shown that androgen replacement therapy is an independent risk factor for development of prostate cancer. Androgen administration seems to be beneficial in decreasing fatal cardiovascular events, body fat mass, and insulin resistance. Overall, the current clinical data seems to suggest that androgen replacement is an appropriate therapeutic option for men with symptomatic hypogonadism provided that patients continue to receive regular prostate screenings.

Neuroimaging studies in these patients are typically reported as normal, but nonspecific findings such as thinning of the corpus callosum and increased pericerebral spaces have been reported. A review of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 11 individuals seen at the Massachusetts General Hospital Dup15q Center was performed. Hippocampus morphology was specifically reviewed, as a recent neuropathologic study has found frequent hippocampal heterotopias and dysplasias in these disorders. Two subjects had unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and 6 had bilateral hippocampal malformations. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was present in 2 subjects.  ",0
995,29909780,Sinonasal papilloma: what influences the decision to request a magnetic resonance imaging scan?,"Computed tomography is the standard pre-operative imaging modality for sinonasal papilloma. The complementary use of magnetic resonance imaging as an additional investigation is debated. This study aimed to establish whether magnetic resonance imaging can accurately detect tumour extent and is a useful adjunct to computed tomography. A retrospective review was conducted on 19 patients with sinonasal papilloma. The interpretation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, by three clinicians, was conducted by comparing prediction of tumour extent. The perceived necessity of magnetic resonance imaging was compared between clinicians. The addition of magnetic resonance imaging improved accuracy of pre-operative interpretation; specifically, this finding was significant in cases with frontal sinus involvement. Surgeons were more likely than a radiologist to request magnetic resonance imaging, particularly when computed tomography indicated frontal sinus disease. Pre-operative combined magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography helped predict disease in the frontal sinus better than computed tomography alone. A close working relationship between the ENT and radiology departments is important for accurate tumour localisation. ",0
996,3109761,Elevation in cytosolic free calcium concentration early in myocardial ischemia in perfused rat heart,"Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration during myocardial ischemia were measured by 19F NMR in 5FBAPTA-loaded perfused rat hearts. The hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 microM of the acetoxymethyl ester of 5FBAPTA, which was hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases to achieve cytosolic concentrations of 5FBAPTA of 0.12 to 0.65 mM. Cytosolic free calcium concentrations were calculated as the product of the ratio of peak areas for bound and free 5FBAPTA in the NMR spectra and the dissociation constant (708 nM). The basal cytosolic calcium concentration, measured in potassium or magnesium arrested hearts, was 252 nM, and the time-average calcium concentration in beating hearts was 630 nM. Following the onset of total ischemia, there was no immediate substantial change in cytosolic calcium despite a rapid decline in creatine phosphate and ATP and a marked increase in inorganic phosphate as monitored by 31P NMR, but by 10 minutes, there was a substantial increase in free calcium concentration. The ratio of peak areas of bound and free 5FBAPTA returned to the preischemic value during reperfusion, and there was no detectable loss of 5FBAPTA from the heart. Creatine phosphate was also restored to its preischemic level during reperfusion. These results indicate that cytosolic free calcium increases during ischemia and is not immediately associated with lethal injury. This increase in cytosolic calcium may activate degradative enzymes that eventually could compromise myocyte viability. ",0

The role of the race of the physician in this pattern is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction in 1994 and 1995, to evaluate whether differences between black patients and white patients in the use of cardiac catheterization within 60 days after acute myocardial infarction varied according to the race of their attending physician. RESULTS: Our study cohort consisted of 35,676 white and 4039 black patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated by 17,550 white and 588 black physicians. Black patients had lower rates of cardiac catheterization than white patients, regardless of whether their attending physician was white (rate of catheterization, 38.4 percent vs. 45.7 percent; P< 0.001) or black (38.2 percent vs. 49.6 percent, P<0.001). We did not find a significant interaction between the race of the patients and the race of the physicians in the use of cardiac catheterization. The adjusted mortality rate among black patients was lower than or similar to that among white patients for up to three years after the infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in the use of cardiac catheterization are similar among patients treated by white physicians and those treated by black physicians, suggesting that this pattern of care is independent of the race of the physician.",0
1001,30222236,Factors associated with first thrombosis in patients presenting with obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in the APS Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking Clinical Database and Repository: a retrospective study,"To evaluate the subsequent rate of thrombosis among women with obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (Ob-APS) in a multicentre database of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive patients, and the clinical utility of the adjusted Global Antiphospholipid Syndrome Score (aGAPSS), a validated tool to assess the likelihood of developing new thrombosis, in this group of patients. Retrospective study. The Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking Clinical Database and Repository. Women with Ob-APS. Comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics and measurement of aGAPSS in women with Ob-APS, with or without thrombosis, after initial pregnancy morbidity (PM). Risk factors for thrombosis and aGAPSS. Of 550 patients, 126 had Ob-APS; 74/126 (59%) presented with thrombosis, and 47 (63%) of these women developed thrombosis after initial PM, in a mean time of 7.6 ± 8.2 years (4.9/100 patient years). Younger age at diagnosis of Ob-APS, additional cardiovascular risk factors, superficial vein thrombosis, heart valve disease, and multiple aPL positivity increased the risk of first thrombosis after PM. Women with thrombosis after PM had a higher aGAPSS compared with women with Ob-APS alone [median 11.5 (4-16) versus 9 (4-13); P = 0.0089]. Based on a retrospective analysis of our multicentre aPL database, 63% of women with Ob-APS developed thrombosis after initial obstetric morbidity; additional thrombosis risk factors, selected clinical manifestations, and high-risk aPL profile increased the risk. Women with subsequent thrombosis after Ob-APS had a higher aGAPSS at entry to the registry. We believe that aGAPSS is a valid tool to improve risk stratification in aPL-positive women. More than 60% of women with obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome had thrombosis after initial pregnancy morbidity. ",0

On August 21, right high orchietomy was performed. This was diagnosed histologically as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse large cell type), and the patient was transferred to our department on September 11 for further examination and treatment. As enlargement of the lymph nodes around the abdominal aorta was evident, it was diagnosed as stage IIA according to the Ann Arbor Classification. Beginning on September 21, three courses of COP-BLAM therapy (CPM, VCR, PDN, BLM, ADR, PCZ) were administered (the third course started on November 8) to achieve complete remission. Hepatic dysfunction appeared, however, from November 16, and by November 19, GOT and GPT increased to 6700 and 2120, respectively, with aggravation of jaundice. PDN therapy was instituted, and GOT and GPT improved gradually, but jaundice did not improve. On December 22, laparoscopy was performed, and liver biopsy produced histologic findings of drug-induced hepatitis. Further, lymphoblastic response was positive for CPM. Hepatic failure occurred on December 29, and plasma exchange was performed, but it failed to improve the condition, and the patient died on January 15. We described a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma complicated by hepatic dysfunction, probably induced by CPM, in an elderly patient who died to hepatic failure.",1
1004,8841996,Downregulation of muscarinic M2 receptors linked to K+ current in cultured guinea-pig atrial myocytes,"1. Desensitization of muscarinic K+ current (IK(ACh)) was studied in cultured atrial myocytes from guinea-pig hearts using whole-cell voltage clamp. 2. Three different types of desensitization could be identified. A fast component which upon rapid superfusion with ACh resulted in a partial relaxation of IK(ACh) within a few seconds to a plateau which was maintained in the presence of ACh. Recovery from this type of desensitization paralleled the decay of IK(ACh) after washout of the agonist. A second type of desensitization was observed within minutes. This was reversed around 10 min after washout of ACh. Both types were heterologous with regard to the A1 receptor and the novel phospholipid (Pl) receptor, both of which activate IK(ACh) via the same signalling pathway. 3. A third type of desensitization (downregulation) occurred upon exposure of the cultures for 24-48 h to the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh). The level of downregulation depended on the concentration of CCh (0.1 microM < or = [CCh] < or = 10 microM). No recovery was observed within 5 h after washout of CCh. Thereafter sensitivity to ACh slowly returned (half-time (t1/2), approximately 20 h). 4. Downregulation by CCh (0.1-5 microM) was characterized by an increase in EC50 for ACh with no reduction in maximum IK(ACh). With 5 microM CCh, EC50 was increased from 0.1 to 3.7 microM. At 10 microM CCh EC50 was increased to 15 microM and maximal current that could be evoked by ACh was reduced to 15%. 5. Downregulation by CCh was homologous with regard to A1 and Pl receptors. Maximum IK(ACh), assayed by a saturating concentration of Pl, was not reduced in downregulated cells, suggesting a mechanism localized at the M2 receptor. 6. The changes in the concentration-response curves can be accounted for by assuming an excess of M2 receptors relative to the subsequent component of the signalling pathway. 7. As the intact heart is under tonic vagal control, downregulation is likely to contribute to controlling the sensitivity of the heart to vagal activity in situ. ",0
1005,10370221,"Effect of ethanol/propylene glycol on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of aspirin, biophysical changes and macroscopic barrier properties of the skin","The effect of the solvent systems ethanol (EtOH), propylene glycol (PG) and combinations thereof was examined on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of the antithrombotic, aspirin, through porcine epidermis. Biophysical changes in the stratum corneum lipids were studied through the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Macroscopic barrier properties of the epidermis were examined through the use of in vitro transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The flux of aspirin increased with increasing concentrations of EtOH in the solvent systems. The maximum flux of aspirin was achieved by 80% EtOH in combination with 20% PG beyond which (i.e. 100% EtOH) there was no increase in the flux. FTIR spectroscopic study was enacted in order to determine the biophysical properties of the stratum corneum when the solvents were applied. The FTIR spectra of the stratum corneum treated with 80% EtOH/20% PG showed a maximum decrease in absorbance for the asymmetric and symmetric C&z. sbnd;H peaks, which suggests a greater loss of the lipids in the stratum corneum layers. In vitro TEWL studies allowed an investigation into the macroscopic barrier integrity properties of the stratum corneum. The TEWL results indicated that each of the solvent systems significantly enhanced (P<0.05) in vitro TEWL in comparison to the control. In conclusion, 80% EtOH/20% PG enhanced the percutaneous absorption of aspirin by perturbing the macroscopic barrier integrity of the stratum corneum and through a loss of stratum corneum lipids. ",0
1006,19573963,An intradialysis diagnostic test for restless legs syndrome: a pilot study,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in dialysis patients, but a simple diagnostic test is not available. Diagnostic test study. 32 patients with RLS and 29 patients without RLS in 2 dialysis centers. The suggested immobilization test (SIT) was performed during dialysis for at least 30 minutes, and periodic limb movements (PLMs) were assessed by means of electromyography of the anterior tibialis muscles using a Holter monitor as an electromyographic monitoring device. We also assessed changes in number of leg movements on the 30-minute SIT (SIT-PLM) after 4 weeks of treatment with the dopamine agonist pergolide. Clinical review by a neurologist, International RLS Rating Scale (IRLSRS) score, and changes in IRLSRS score after pergolide treatment. PLMs on the 30-minute SIT during dialysis were identified in 20 of 32 patients with RLS and 3 of 29 control participants. Sensitivity and specificity of PLMs on the 30-minute SIT during dialysis for RLS diagnosis were 63% and 90%, respectively. SIT-PLM correlated with IRLSRS total score at diagnosis (r = 0.53; P = 0.03), suggesting that SIT-PLM measures the general severity of RLS in uremic patients. Treatment with the dopamine agonist pergolide significantly reduced the IRLSRS total score (from a mean of 24.9 +/- 9.1 [SD] to 9.5 +/- 6.8; P < 0.01) and SIT-PLM (from 41.9 +/- 24.2 to 11.3 +/- 12.3; P < 0.01), but correlation between changes in SIT-PLM and those in IRLSRS score was not significant (r = 0.27; P = 0.3). Poor correlation may be caused by the small sample size. Time available for the SIT was limited because of the patient's condition during dialysis. Time of day during SIT, mental-alerting activities during SIT, or hemodialysis therapy itself may influence the severity of PLMs. A Holter-monitored SIT during dialysis is a valid method for the diagnosis of RLS and to evaluate the effect of treatment with pergolide in uremic patients.

1007,12399158,Mechanisms of idiosyncratic drug reactions: the case of felbamate,"""Idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDR) are a specific type of drug toxicity characterized by their delayed onset, low incidence and reactive metabolite formation with little, if any, correlation between pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics and the toxicological outcome. As the name implies, IDR are unpredictable and often result in the post marketing failure of otherwise useful therapies. Examples of drugs, which have failed as a result of IDR in recent years, include trovafloxacin, zileuton, troglitazone, tolcapone and felbamate. To date there exists no pre-clinical model to predict these adverse drug reactions and a mechanistic understanding of these toxicities remains limited. In an attempt to better understand this class of drug toxicities and gain mechanistic insight, we have studied the IDR associated with a model compound, felbamate. Our studies with felbamate are consistent with the theory that compounds which cause IDR undergo bioactivation to a highly reactive electrophilic metabolite that is capable of forming covalent protein adducts in vivo. In additon, our data suggest that under normal physiological conditions glutathione plays a protective role in preventing IDR during felbamate therapy, further emphasizing a correlation between reactive metabolite formation and a toxic outcome. Clinical studies with felbamate have been able to demonstrate an association between reactive metabolite formation and a clinically relevant toxicity; however, additional research is required to more fully understand the link between reactive metabolite formation and the events which elicit toxicity. Going forward, it seems reasonable that screening for reactive metabolite formation in early drug discovery may be an important tool in eliminating the post-marketing failure of otherwise useful therapies.""",1
1008,1628148,"The effect of lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor on the hepatic accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine and platelets in the mouse","1. Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5-500 microgram kg-1) into mice induced a dose-dependent, slowly developing increase in hepatic content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). This sustained increase could not be attributed to an LPS-induced alteration of the pharmacokinetic handling of 5-HT by stimulation of its uptake or inhibition of its degradation. 2. Regional differences were apparent in the tissue content of histamine and 5-HT between mast cell-deficient (W/Wv) and normal (+/+) mice. LPS administration (0.5 mg kg-1) gave comparable increases in the hepatic level of 5-HT in mast cell-deficient and normal mice. 3. Reserpine pretreatment (1 mg kg-1) selectively reduced 5-HT levels in the blood, spleen, liver, brain and lung of normal mice. Prior treatment with this agent also abolished the LPS (0.5 mg kg-1)-induced hepatic accumulation of 5-HT. 4. Accumulation of 5-HT in the liver by LPS (0.1 mg kg-1) was temporally associated with both a fall in the levels of circulating platelets, and a reduction in the concentration of 5-HT in the blood. The LPS dose-dependent (0.5-500 micrograms kg-1) increase in hepatic 5-HT content was associated with a similar dose-dependent reduction in the circulating levels of 5-HT. 5. Interleukin-1, alpha and beta (10 micrograms kg-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (1 mg kg-1) significantly enhanced the accumulation of 5-HT within the liver. Administration of TNF alpha (10 micrograms kg-1) potentiated the increase in hepatic 5-HT content seen with IL-1 beta (10 micrograms kg-1). 6. Electron microscopy revealed numerous platelets in the sinusoidal and perisinusoidal Disse spaces within the liver, in animals pretreated with LPS (0.1 mg kg '). The platelets retained their intact structure and showed no evidence of degranulation. 7. These data suggest that the LPS and cytokine-induced mobilization of 5-HT in the liver is associated with the hepatic translocation of platelets. This migration appears to be independent of platelet aggregation. ",0
1009,15728808,"Effectiveness of mass oral cholera vaccination in Beira, Mozambique","BACKGROUND: New-generation, orally administered cholera vaccines offer the promise of improved control of cholera in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in many cholera-affected African populations has raised doubts about the level of protection possible with vaccination. We evaluated a mass immunization program with recombinant cholera-toxin B subunit, killed whole-cell (rBS-WC) oral cholera vaccine in Beira, Mozambique, a city where the seroprevalence of HIV is 20 to 30 percent. METHODS: From December 2003 to January 2004, we undertook mass immunization of nonpregnant persons at least two years of age, using a two-dose regimen of rBS-WC vaccine in Esturro, Beira (population 21,818). We then assessed vaccine protection in a case-control study during an outbreak of El Tor Ogawa cholera in Beira between January and May 2004. To estimate the level of vaccine protection, antecedent rates of vaccination were compared between persons with culture-confirmed cholera severe enough to have prompted them to seek treatment and age- and sex-matched neighborhood controls without treated diarrhea. RESULTS: We assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine in 43 persons with cholera and 172 controls. Receipt of one or more doses of rBS-WC vaccine was associated with 78 percent protection (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 92 percent; P=0.004). The vaccine was equally effective in children younger than five years of age and in older persons. A concurrently conducted case-control study designed to detect bias compared persons with treated, noncholeraic diarrhea and controls without diarrhea in the same population and found no protection associated with receipt of the rBS-WC vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The rBS-WC vaccine was highly effective against clinically significant cholera in an urban sub-Saharan African population with a high prevalence of HIV infection.",0
1010,27432917,Multicenter Phase II Study of Whole-Body and Intracranial Activity With Ceritinib in Patients With ALK-Rearranged Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy and Crizotinib: Results From ASCEND-2,"""PURPOSE: Phase I data (ASCEND-1) showed ceritinib efficacy in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), regardless of brain metastases status and with or without prior therapy with an inhibitor of the ALK protein. Data are presented from a phase II trial (ASCEND-2) in which ceritinib efficacy and safety were evaluated in patients who had ALK-rearranged NSCLC previously treated with at least one platinum-based chemotherapy and who had experienced progression during crizotinib treatment as their last prior therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those with asymptomatic or neurologically stable baseline brain metastases, received oral ceritinib 750 mg/d. Whole-body and intracranial responses were investigator assessed (according to RECIST version 1.1). Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated with the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer surveys (the core-30 and the 13-item lung cancer-specific quality-of-life questionnaires). RESULTS: All 140 patients enrolled had received two or more previous treatment regimens, and all patients had received crizotinib. The median duration of exposure and the follow-up time with ceritinib were 8.8 months (range, 0.1 to 19.4 months) and 11.3 months (range, 0.1 to 18.9 months), respectively. Investigator-assessed overall response rate was 38.6% (95% CI, 30.5% to 47.2%). Secondary end points, all investigator assessed, included disease control rate (77.1%; 95% CI, 69.3% to 83.8%), time to response (median, 1.8 months; range, 1.6 to 5.6 months), duration of response (median, 9.7 months; 95% CI, 7.1 to 11.1 months), and progression-free survival (median, 5.7 months; 95% CI, 5.4 to 7.6 months). Of 100 patients with baseline brain metastases, 20 had active target lesions at baseline; investigator-assessed intracranial overall response rate was 45.0% (95% CI, 23.1% to 68.5%). The most common adverse events (majority, grade 1 or 2) for all treated patients were nausea (81.4%), diarrhea (80.0%), and vomiting (62.9%). Patient-reported outcomes showed a trend toward improved symptom burden. The global quality-of-life score was maintained during treatment. CONCLUSION: Consistent with its activity in ASCEND-1, ceritinib treatment provided clinically meaningful and durable responses with manageable tolerability in chemotherapy- and crizotinib-pretreated patients, including those with brain metastases.""",1
1011,18945932,Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r-induced systemic resistance in rice against Magnaporthe oryzae is based on pseudobactin-mediated priming for a salicylic acid-repressible multifaceted defense response,"Selected strains of nonpathogenic rhizobacteria can reduce disease in foliar tissues through the induction of a defense state known as induced systemic resistance (ISR). Compared with the large body of information on ISR in dicotyledonous plants, little is known about the mechanisms underlying rhizobacteria-induced resistance in cereal crops. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r to trigger ISR in rice (Oryza sativa) against the leaf blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Using salicylic acid (SA)-nonaccumulating NahG rice, an ethylene-insensitive OsEIN2 antisense line, and the jasmonate-deficient mutant hebiba, we show that this WCS374r-induced resistance is regulated by an SA-independent but jasmonic acid/ethylene-modulated signal transduction pathway. Bacterial mutant analysis uncovered a pseudobactin-type siderophore as the crucial determinant responsible for ISR elicitation. Root application of WCS374r-derived pseudobactin (Psb374) primed naive leaves for accelerated expression of a pronounced multifaceted defense response, consisting of rapid recruitment of phenolic compounds at sites of pathogen entry, concerted expression of a diverse set of structural defenses, and a timely hyperinduction of hydrogen peroxide formation putatively driving cell wall fortification. Exogenous SA application alleviated this Psb374-modulated defense priming, while Psb374 pretreatment antagonized infection-induced transcription of SA-responsive PR genes, suggesting that the Psb374- and SA-modulated signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic. Interestingly, in sharp contrast to WCS374r-mediated ISR, chemical induction of blast resistance by the SA analog benzothiadiazole was independent of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling and involved the potentiation of SA-responsive gene expression. Together, these results offer novel insights into the signaling circuitry governing induced resistance against M. oryzae and suggest that rice is endowed with multiple blast-effective resistance pathways.

Cohort study with at least 2 years of follow-up. A teaching hospital in Paris, France (Hôpital Pitié-Salpétrière). Sixteen patients with idiopathic autoimmune uveitis who were normotensive and had normal renal function before treatment. Cyclosporine was administered orally for at least 2 years at an initial dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight per day. After 2 years of treatment, the serum creatinine level increased by 35 +/- 5 mumol/L (0.40 +/- 0.06 mg/dL) (95% CI, 25 to 46 mumol/L, [73 +/- 4 to 108 +/- 4 mumol/L]). Creatinine clearance decreased significantly from 120 +/- 5 mL/min to 75 +/- 4 mL/min. Glomerular filtration rate decreased from 116 +/- 8 mL/min to 75 +/- 3 mL/min, and effective renal plasma flow decreased from 455 +/- 24 mL/min to 338 +/- 30 mL/min (P less than 0.05). Cyclosporine induced a significant increase in serum uric acid, total cholesterol, and serum potassium levels. Blood pressure was normal in all patients before treatment; 81% (95% CI, 64% to 98%) of these patients developed hypertension after 24 months of treatment. Blood pressure was controlled with a single drug in all but two patients. In patients with healthy native kidneys, long-term cyclosporine therapy, even at a low dose (5 mg/kg per day), is nephrotoxic and is associated with a high incidence of hypertension. ",0
1014,9881458,Light-induced cGMP-phosphodiesterase activity in intact rat retinal rod cells as revealed by rapid-freezing enzyme cytochemistry,"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE) in the outer segment of vertebrate retinal rod cells is one of key enzymes mediating phototransduction. We report here on light-induced PDE activity in intact rat retinal rod cells processed by rapid-freezing enzyme cytochemistry, a new morphological technique that is a combination of rapid-freezing, freeze-substitution fixation, and subsequent enzyme cytochemistry. This technique quickly immobilizes and preserves both enzyme activity and the cell ultrastructure in a state approximating living conditions; consequently, it has proved useful for cytochemical detection of light-induced PDE activity. Using this technique we observed that the catalytic site of PDE molecules in rapid-frozen outer segments was predominantly located in the extradiscal spaces; PDE activity was significantly greater in light than in darkness; and illumination elicited marked increases in PDE activity in dark-adapted cells. Light-induced PDE activity was first cytochemically detected after 3 s of illumination and reached a peak within 5 s, at which time it was in virtually the same as that seen in fully light adapted cells. In addition, cytochemical guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity in dark-adapted cells, as well as corresponding PDE activity, increased in a time-dependent manner with illumination duration; this acceleration in GTPase activity closely paralleled the PDE activity. Thus, our results suggest, in part, the existence of reciprocal regulation of PDE and activated transducin alpha subunit, thereby modulating light adaptation in rod cells. ",0
1015,11870241,Hematologic and cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate in chronic myelogenous leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the product of the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib mesylate, formerly STI571, is a selective inhibitor of this kinase. METHODS: A total of 532 patients with late--chronic-phase CML in whom previous therapy with interferon alfa had failed were treated with 400 mg of oral imatinib daily. Patients were evaluated for cytogenetic and hematologic responses. Time to progression, survival, and toxic effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: Imatinib induced major cytogenetic responses in 60 percent of the 454 patients with confirmed chronic-phase CML and complete hematologic responses in 95 percent. After a median follow-up of 18 months, CML had not progressed to the accelerated or blast phases in an estimated 89 percent of patients, and 95 percent of the patients were alive. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxic effects were infrequent, and hematologic toxic effects were manageable. Only 2 percent of patients discontinued treatment because of drug-related adverse events, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib induced high rates of cytogenetic and hematologic responses in patients with chronic-phase CML in whom previous interferon therapy had failed.",1
1016,20979469,Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer,"""BACKGROUND: Oncogenic fusion genes consisting of EML4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are present in a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers, representing 2 to 7% of such tumors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. METHODS: After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. RESULTS: Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

1017,12639171,Recurrent cholestasis due to ampicillin,"OBJECTIVE: To present a single case of ampicillin-induced recurrent cholestasis and a literature review. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old man was hospitalized due to recurrent and self-limited cholestatic symptoms. He had used ampicillin before each cholestatic attack. He became well clinically and biochemically each time after cessation of the drug. One year after his recovery and discontinuance of ampicillin, the patient has had no recurrence of cholestasis. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable. DISCUSSION: Ampicillin-related hepatotoxicity is very rare, with injury being mainly hepatocellular. To our knowledge, there is only 1 case report in the literature referring to chronic cholestatic-type hepatotoxicity related to ampicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Ampicillin, which is one of the most widely used antibiotics, may cause recurrent cholestatic hepatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect, and it should be kept in mind during diagnostic workup of liver injury.",1

1020,23133319,Efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer,Metastatic and unresectable medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is often difficult to treat as it is relatively unresponsive to radiation and conventional chemotherapy. This emphasizes the importance of the development of targeted therapies for advanced MTC. Vandetanib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with advanced disease in April 2011. This therapy proved to be a breakthrough in the management of MTC. We review the efficacy and safety of this novel treatment and other treatments that are being evaluated in this disease.,1
1021,9652559,Randomised trial of basiliximab versus placebo for control of acute cellular rejection in renal allograft recipients. CHIB 201 International Study Group,"""BACKGROUND: Currently available immunosuppressive regimens for cadaver-kidney recipients are far from ideal because acute-rejection episodes occur in about 30% to 50% of these patients. In the phase III study described here we assessed the ability of basiliximab, a chimeric interleukin (IL)-2 receptor monoclonal antibody, to prevent acute-rejection episodes in renal allograft recipients. METHODS: 380 adult recipients of a primary cadaveric kidney transplant were randomly allocated, in this double-blind trial, to receive a 20 mg infusion of basiliximab on day 0 (day of surgery) and on day 4, to provide IL-2-receptor suppression for 4-6 weeks (n=193), or to receive placebo (n=187). Both groups received baseline dual immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin and steroids throughout the study. The primary outcome measure was incidence of acute-rejection episodes during the 6 months after transplantation. Safety and tolerability were monitored over the 12 months of the study. FINDINGS: 376 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis (basiliximab, n=190; placebo, n=186). No significant differences in patient characteristics were apparent. The incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection 6 months after transplantation was 51 (29.8%) of 171 in the basiliximab group compared with 73 (44.0%) of 166 in the placebo group (32% reduction; 14.2% difference [95% Kaplan-Meier CIs 3% to 24%], p=0.012). The incidence of steroid-resistant first rejection episodes that required antibody therapy was significantly lower in the basiliximab group (10% vs 23.1%, 13.1% difference [5.4% to 20.8%], p<0.001). At weeks 2 and 4 post-transplantation, the mean daily dose of steroids was significantly higher in the placebo group (p<0.001 with one-way analysis of variance). The incidence of graft loss at 12 months post-transplantation was 23 (12.1%) of 190 in the basiliximab group and 25 (13.4%) of 186 in the placebo group (1.3% difference [-5% to 9%], p=0.591). The incidence of infection and other adverse events was similar in the two treatment groups. The acute tolerability of basiliximab was excellent, with no evidence of cytokine-release syndrome. 14 deaths (basiliximab n=9; placebo n=5; -2.0% difference [-6% to 2%], p=0.293) occurred during the 12-month study and a further three deaths (basiliximab n=1; placebo n=2) occurred within the 380-day cut-off period. One post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was recorded in each group. INTERPRETATION: Prophylaxis with 40 mg basiliximab reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes significantly, with no clinically relevant safety or tolerability concerns.""",1

In a phase I trial, an encouraging activity in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was noted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a phase II trial (NCT00097929) of oral vorinostat 300 mg b.i.d. (14 days/3 weeks or 3 days/week) in patients with measurable, relapsed DLBCL who had received two or more systemic therapies. Response rate and duration (DOR), time to progression (TTP) and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled (median age: 66 years; median prior therapies: 2). Seven received 300 mg b.i.d. 14 days/3 weeks, but four had grade 3 or 4 toxicity (dose-limiting toxicity, DLT). The schedule was amended to 300 mg b.i.d. 3 days/week), and none had DLT. One achieved a complete response (TtR = 85 days; DOR =or >468 days) and one had stable disease (301 days). Sixteen discontinued for progressive disease; median TTP was 44 days. Median number of cycles was 2 (1 to >19). Common drug-related adverse experiences (AEs; mostly grade 1/2) were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, anemia and vomiting. Three patients had dose reduction; none discontinued for drug-related AEs. Drug-related AE >or=grade 3 included thrombocytopenia (16.7%) and asthenia (11.1%).

1025,19937651,Clinical presentation and molecular pathophysiology of autosomal dominant hemochromatosis caused by a novel ferroportin mutation,"Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. Ferroportin is inhibited directly by hepcidin, a key iron-regulatory peptide, and functional consequences of SLC40A1 mutations account for observed phenotypic differences in patients with ferroportin disease. We describe a large pedigree with a novel SLC40A1 mutation and, through in vitro analysis, elucidate the associated molecular mechanism of iron overload. The entire coding sequence of the SLC40A1 gene was sequenced in a pedigree, presenting with autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia. The functional effects of a novel SLC40A1 mutation were studied by overexpression of wild-type and mutant ferroportin fusion proteins in human embryonic kidney cells. Iron export was studied in these cells using (59)Fe transport assays; subcellular localization of ferroportin was examined by way of confocal microscopy. A novel SLC40A1 mutation p.R489K segregated with iron overload in a family with clinical and histopathological signs of macrophage-type ferroportin disease. Human embryonic kidney cells overexpressing p.R489K ferroportin showed decreased iron export capacity when compared with wild-type ferroportin overexpressing cells. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated that p.R489K ferroportin was retained abnormally within an intracellular compartment. CONCLUSION: We report a novel pathological SLC40A1 variant associated with abnormal cell surface expression of ferroportin due to intracellular retention of the mutant protein. These findings predict macrophage-type ferroportin disease, the phenotype observed in this kindred. Study of the molecular cell biology of ferroportin and its mutants is key to understanding the pathogenesis of this increasingly recognized form of hemochromatosis, which responds poorly to conventional therapy.",0
1026,20484391,CISH and susceptibility to infectious diseases,"BACKGROUND: The interleukin-2-mediated immune response is critical for host defense against infectious pathogens. Cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain protein (CISH), a suppressor of cytokine signaling, controls interleukin-2 signaling. METHODS: Using a case-control design, we tested for an association between CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to major infectious diseases (bacteremia, tuberculosis, and severe malaria) in blood samples from 8402 persons in Gambia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malawi, and Vietnam. We had previously tested 20 other immune-related genes in one or more of these sample collections. RESULTS: We observed associations between variant alleles of multiple CISH polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to each infectious disease in each of the study populations. When all five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (at positions -639, -292, -163, +1320, and +3415 [all relative to CISH]) within the CISH-associated locus were considered together in a multiple-SNP score, we found an association between CISH genetic variants and susceptibility to bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis (P=3.8x10(-11) for all comparisons), with -292 accounting for most of the association signal (P=4.58x10(-7)). Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells obtained from adult subjects carrying the -292 variant, as compared with wild-type cells, showed a muted response to the stimulation of interleukin-2 production--that is, 25 to 40% less CISH expression. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of CISH are associated with susceptibility to diseases caused by diverse infectious pathogens, suggesting that negative regulators of cytokine signaling have a role in immunity against various infectious diseases. The overall risk of one of these infectious diseases was increased by at least 18% among persons carrying the variant CISH alleles.",0
1027,2984567,Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell proliferations of diverse clonal origins after bone marrow transplantation in a 12-year-old patient with severe combined immunodeficiency,"A 12-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency who had been kept in a gnotobiotic environment since birth received bone marrow from a histoincompatible sibling in an attempt to reconstitute immunologic function. To prevent graft versus host disease, the donor's marrow was treated in vitro with monoclonal antibody and complement to remove alloreactive T cells. Eighty days after transplantation, the patient had a systemic illness characterized by fever, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal pain, and bleeding; he died on the 124th post-transplantation day. Postmortem examination revealed multiple tumor-like B-cell proliferations, recipient in origin, in numerous organs. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was isolated from the patient's pharyngeal secretions; EBV nuclear antigen was found in spontaneously transformed peripheral-blood lymphocytes, inflammatory cells from peritoneal fluid, and bone marrow cells; and EBV genomes were discovered in all tumor tissues. The donor's serum showed evidence of past EBV infection. Analysis of cellular immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin gene DNA from the tumors indicated both monoclonal and oligoclonal B-cell proliferations. These findings provide evidence for the evolution of EBV-induced polyclonal activation of B cells to oligoclonal B-cell proliferation and finally to monoclonal B-cell lymphoma.",0

METHODS: All reports of suspected ADRs with a fatal outcome in children received by the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines through its Yellow Card Scheme from 1964 until December 2000 were reviewed. Reports associated with vaccines and overdose were excluded. The medicine, date of the report, diagnosis, ADR, and the age of the child were analysed. No formal causality assessment was performed. RESULTS: There were 331 deaths with 390 suspected medicines reported for children aged 16 years or less. Medicines most frequently mentioned were anticonvulsants (65 deaths), cytotoxics (34 deaths), anaesthetic agents (30 deaths), and antibiotics (29 deaths). The individual drug most frequently mentioned was sodium valproate (31 deaths). The nature of the reported ADRs were diverse, with hepatic failure the most frequent. In the past decade, there has been an increase in both the total number of suspected ADRs reported in children and the number of reports with a fatal outcome.

1030,22356322,Colonoscopic polypectomy and long-term prevention of colorectal-cancer deaths,"BACKGROUND: In the National Polyp Study (NPS), colorectal cancer was prevented by colonoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps. We evaluated the long-term effect of colonoscopic polypectomy in a study on mortality from colorectal cancer. METHODS: We included in this analysis all patients prospectively referred for initial colonoscopy (between 1980 and 1990) at NPS clinical centers who had polyps (adenomas and nonadenomas). The National Death Index was used to identify deaths and to determine the cause of death; follow-up time was as long as 23 years. Mortality from colorectal cancer among patients with adenomas removed was compared with the expected incidence-based mortality from colorectal cancer in the general population, as estimated from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, and with the observed mortality from colorectal cancer among patients with nonadenomatous polyps (internal control group). RESULTS: Among 2602 patients who had adenomas removed during participation in the study, after a median of 15.8 years, 1246 patients had died from any cause and 12 had died from colorectal cancer. Given an estimated 25.4 expected deaths from colorectal cancer in the general population, the standardized incidence-based mortality ratio was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.80) with colonoscopic polypectomy, suggesting a 53% reduction in mortality. Mortality from colorectal cancer was similar among patients with adenomas and those with nonadenomatous polyps during the first 10 years after polypectomy (relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 10.6). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that colonoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps prevents death from colorectal cancer. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.).",0
1031,32558469,Systematic or Test-Guided Treatment for Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Adults,"BACKGROUND: In regions with high burdens of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), many HIV-infected adults begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) when they are already severely immunocompromised. Mortality after ART initiation is high in these patients, and tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases are common causes of death. METHODS: We conducted a 48-week trial of empirical treatment for tuberculosis as compared with treatment guided by testing in HIV-infected adults who had not previously received ART and had CD4+ T-cell counts below 100 cells per cubic millimeter. Patients recruited in Ivory Coast, Uganda, Cambodia, and Vietnam were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo screening (Xpert MTB/RIF test, urinary lipoarabinomannan test, and chest radiography) to determine whether treatment for tuberculosis should be started or to receive systematic empirical treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide daily for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid daily for 4 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or invasive bacterial disease within 24 weeks (primary analysis) or within 48 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 522 patients in the systematic-treatment group and 525 in the guided-treatment group were included in the analyses. At week 24, the rate of death from any cause or invasive bacterial disease (calculated as the number of first events per 100 patient-years) was 19.4 with systematic treatment and 20.3 with guided treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.44). At week 48, the corresponding rates were 12.8 and 13.3 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.40]). At week 24, the probability of tuberculosis was lower with systematic treatment than with guided treatment (3.0% vs. 17.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26), but the probability of grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events was higher with systematic treatment (17.4% vs. 7.2%; adjusted hazard ratio 2.57; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.78). Serious adverse events were more common with systematic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among severely immunosuppressed adults with HIV infection who had not previously received ART, systematic treatment for tuberculosis was not superior to test-guided treatment in reducing the rate of death or invasive bacterial disease over 24 or 48 weeks and was associated with more grade 3 or 4 adverse events.

1032,29603325,Loss of PDK4 switches the hepatic NF-?B/TNF pathway from pro-survival to pro-apoptosis,"It has been established that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) members promote survival by upregulating antiapoptotic genes and that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NF-?B is required for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that this pro-survival pathway is switched to pro-apoptosis under pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)-deficient conditions. PDK4-deficiency triggered hepatic apoptosis concomitantly with increased numbers of aberrant mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, sustained c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation, and reduction of glutathione (GSH). Interestingly, PDK4 retained p65 in cytoplasm via a direct protein-protein interaction. Disruption of PDK4-p65 association promoted p65 nuclear translocation. This, in turn, facilitated p65 binding to the TNF promoter to activate TNF-TNFR1 apoptotic pathway. Pdk4(-/-) livers were sensitized to Jo2 and D-(+)-Galactosamine /Lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS)-mediated apoptotic injury which was prevented by the inhibition of p65 or TNFR1. The pro-survival activity of TNF was shifted, which was switched to a pro-apoptotic activity in Pdk4(-/-) hepatocytes as a result of impaired activation of pro-survival NF-?B targets. Conclusion: PDK4 is indispensable to dictate the fate of TNF/NF-?B-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. (Hepatology 2018).",0
1033,2761587,A randomized trial comparing ticlopidine hydrochloride with aspirin for the prevention of stroke in high-risk patients. Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study Group,"We report the results of the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study, a blinded trial at 56 North American centers that compared the effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride (500 mg daily) with those of aspirin (1300 mg daily) on the risk of stroke or death. The medications were randomly assigned to 3069 patients with recent transient or mild persistent focal cerebral or retinal ischemia. Follow-up lasted for two to six years. The three-year event rate for nonfatal stroke or death from any cause was 17 percent for ticlopidine and 19 percent for aspirin--a 12 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, -2 to 26 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.048 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). The rates of fatal and nonfatal stroke at three years were 10 percent for ticlopidine and 13 percent for aspirin--a 21 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 38 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.024 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). Ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin in both sexes. The adverse effects of aspirin included diarrhea (10 percent), rash (5.5 percent), peptic ulceration (3 percent), gastritis (2 percent), and gastrointestinal bleeding (1 percent). With ticlopidine, diarrhea (20 percent), skin rash (14 percent), and severe but reversible neutropenia (less than 1 percent) were noted. The mean increase in total cholesterol level was 9 percent with ticlopidine and 2 percent with aspirin (P less than 0.01). The ratios of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol were similar in both treatment groups. We conclude that ticlopidine was somewhat more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in this population, although the risks of side effects were greater.",1
1034,7565970,The influence of smoking cessation on the prevalence of overweight in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of U.S. adults 35 to 74 years of age who were overweight increased by 9.6 percent for men and 8.0 percent for women between 1978 and 1990. Since the prevalence of smoking declined over the same period, smoking cessation has been suggested as a factor contributing to the increasing prevalence of overweight. METHODS: To estimate the influence of smoking cessation on the increase in the prevalence of overweight, we analyzed data on current and past weight and smoking status for a national sample of 5247 adults 35 years of age or older who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 1988 through 1991. The results were adjusted for age, sociodemographic characteristics, level of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and (for women) parity. RESULTS: The weight gain over a 10-year period that was associated with the cessation of smoking (i.e., the gain among smokers who quit that was in excess of the gain among continuing smokers) was 4.4 kg for men and 5.0 kg for women. Smokers who had quit within the past 10 years were significantly more likely than respondents who had never smoked to become overweight (odds ratios, 2.4 for men and 2.0 for women). For men, about a quarter (2.3 of 9.6 percentage points) and for women, about a sixth (1.3 of 8.0 percentage points) of the increase in the prevalence of overweight could be attributed to smoking cessation within the past 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although its health benefits are undeniable, smoking cessation may nevertheless be associated with a small increase in the prevalence of overweight.",0

Although uncommon with plain forms, liver dysfunction has increasingly been associated with sustained-release preparations. This case illustrates transient focal liver defects seen on computed tomography with symptomatic elevation of liver-associated enzymes during treatment with sustained-release niacin. The masses were not evident on radionuclide liver scan, suggesting focal fatty liver. After niacin was discontinued, these abnormalities resolved, and aminotransferases returned to normal. This is the first such reported case.",1
1036,18343454,Central zone carcinoma of the prostate gland: a distinct tumor type with poor prognostic features,"The central zone of the prostate gland is a region rarely associated with carcinoma. To our knowledge central zone tumors have not previously been compared to carcinoma originating in the peripheral or transition zone of the prostate gland. All 2,010 radical prostatectomy cases seen at our institution from October 1998 to December 2006 were reviewed to identify tumor zonal origin. Central zone carcinoma was characterized and compared with tumors of other zones. Zonal origin was determined in a total of 2,494 tumors in 1,703 cases. Of the tumors 63 (2.5%) were of central zone origin with 59 of the 63 representing the index or main tumor. Comparative analysis of a defined subset of 726 cases showed that central zone cancers were significantly more aggressive than peripheral or transition zone cancers with a far greater risk of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive surgical margins. Escape from the gland was often via the ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that the probability of post-prostatectomy biochemical failure was double that of tumors of the other zones with a far more rapid rate of failure. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified Gleason grade, positive margins, extracapsular extension, tumor volume and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen as the major contributors to this poor prognosis, rather than specific zonal origin. To our knowledge this study provides the first characterization and comparative analysis of central zone carcinoma, identifying these tumors as a rare but highly aggressive form of prostate carcinoma with a distinct route of spread from the gland that contrasts with tumors of other zones. Preoperative identification is currently hampered by the avoidance of biopsy targeting the central zone. However, if recognized preoperatively, aggressive intervention may possibly improve the currently bleak outlook. ",0
1037,28475803,Multicentre study of posaconazole delayed-release tablet serum level and association with hepatotoxicity and QTc prolongation,"OBJECTIVES: The association of posaconazole serum concentrations and toxicity is unclear. An assessment of whether levels obtained with the delayed-release tablet (DRT) formulation are correlated with abnormal liver function test (LFT) results and/or QTc prolongation was undertaken. METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study of adult patients with cancer between 26 November 2013 and 14 November 2014. Patients were included if they received posaconazole DRT with a posaconazole level obtained between days 5 and 14. Clinical data, including demographics, hepatotoxic medications, posaconazole levels, LFTs and QTc intervals, were obtained. Association of factors with changes in LFTs and QTc prolongation was assessed using linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-six study patients were included. The median posaconazole level was 1250 (range 110-4220)?ng/mL and the median time until level was 6 (range 5-14) days. There was a statistically significant increase in AST ( P? < ? 0.001), ALT ( P? < ? 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (ALK) ( P? < ? 0.001), total bilirubin (TBILI) ( P? < ? 0.001) and QTc ( P? = ? 0.05) from baseline. Posaconazole levels were not associated with increases in AST [? (SE)?=?-0.33 (2.2), P? = ? 0.88], log ALT [? (SE)?=?-0.02 (0.03), P? = ? 0.63], ALK [? (SE)?=?2.2 (2.9), P? = ? 0.46] and TBILI [? (SE)?=?-0.01 (0.04), P? = ? 0.88]. For each additional hepatotoxic medication, there was a mean change in TBILI of 0.13?mg/dL ( P? = ? 0.02) and ALK of 7.1?U/L ( P? = ? 0.09). No statistically significant association between posaconazole level and QTc interval prolongation was found. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify an association between posaconazole serum concentrations and LFT elevations or QTc prolongation. However, some LFTs were found to increase with more hepatotoxic medications administered.",1
1038,10948380,Hepatotoxicity of botanicals,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatic impairment resulting from the use of conventional drugs is widely acknowledged, but there is less awareness of the potential hepatotoxicity of herbal preparations and other botanicals, many of which are believed to be harmless and are commonly used for self-medication without supervision. The aim of this paper is to examine the evidence for hepatotoxicity of botanicals and draw conclusions regarding their pathology, safety and applications. DESIGN: Current literature on the hepatotoxicity of herbal drugs and other botanicals is reviewed. The aetiology, clinical picture and treatment of mushroom (Amanita) poisoning are described. RESULTS: Hepatotoxic effects have been reported for some Chinese herbal medicines (such as Jin Bu Huan, Ma-Huang and Sho-saiko-to), pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing plants, germander (Teucrium chamaedrys), chaparral (Larrea tridentata), Atractylis gummifera, Callilepsis laureola, and others. The frequency with which botanicals cause hepatic damage is unclear. There is a lack of controlled treatment trials and the few studies published to date do not clarify the incidence of adverse effects. Many plant products do not seem to lead to toxic effects in everyone taking them, and they commonly lack a strict dose-dependency. For some products, such as Sho-saiko-to, the picture is confused further by demonstrations of hepatoprotective properties for some components. Mushroom poisoning is mostly due to the accidental consumption of Amanita species. Treatment with silymarin, thioctic acid, penicillin and liver transplantation have been shown to be effective but require early diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Severe liver injury, including acute and chronic abnormalities and even cirrhotic transformation and liver failure, has been described after the ingestion of a wide range of herbal products and other botanical ingredients, such as mushrooms. It is concluded that in certain situations herbal products may be just as harmful as conventional drugs.",1

Most patients in both groups completed the trial with significant improvement in all quantitative measures of efficacy. Patients treated with D-penicillamine were more likely to have """"important improvement"""" in physician global assessment, swollen joint count, and score and grip strength. The overall frequency of side effects was similar between the two groups; however, more patients were withdrawn for adverse effects from the D-penicillamine group, and proteinuria (greater than or equal to 2+) and thrombocytopenia (less than 100 000 mm3) occurred significantly more frequently with D-penicillamine than auranofin (p = 0.028). These results suggest that in the dosage regimen used, auranofin is safer than D-penicillamine but that D-penicillamine tends to show greater clinical effectiveness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.""",1

1042,2999592,Intra-blood-brain-barrier synthesis of HTLV-III-specific IgG in patients with neurologic symptoms associated with AIDS or AIDS-related complex,"Intra-blood-brain-barrier production of virus-specific antibody is good evidence of infection within the blood-brain barrier. Patients with the acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an increased incidence of neurologic abnormalities--i.e., unexplained, diffuse encephalopathy manifested clinically as chronic progressive dementia. To define the role of human T-cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV-III), the etiologic agent of AIDS, in the pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction, we compared cerebrospinal fluid and serum from patients with neurologic symptoms associated with AIDS and the AIDS-related complex for the presence of antibodies directed against HTLV-III. Antibodies directed against HTLV-III antigens were detected by four immunologic tests: a fixed-cell immunofluorescence assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblots of viral lysates, and immunoprecipitation of cellular lysates. All patients were seropositive, and 22 of 23 (96 per cent) had HTLV-III-specific antibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid. Unique oligoclonal IgG bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the rate of IgG synthesis within the blood-brain barrier was elevated. In eight of nine patients tested, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the percentage of HTLV-III-specific IgG in cerebrospinal fluid was higher than in serum, suggesting that HTLV-III infection of neurologic tissue occurs in the majority of patients with neurologic disease associated with AIDS or its related complex.",0

1045,7075162,Computer systems for facilitating management of the critically ill,"The Shock Research Unit has applied computer technology to the care of the critically ill and injured patient since 1961. The requirements for patient monitoring were initially explored with a process control computer (IBM) 1710). In the current system, a Xerox Sigma-5 computer is utilized for monitoring EKG, hemodynamic, respiratory, and biochemical signals. Electronic preprocessing increases the efficiency and speed of data acquisition and signal analysis. Provisions are made for recording narrative data as part of a commitment to evolve an automated patient record. Bedside displays include both tabular and graphic summaries of patient status and trends. A computer accessible archive of patient files is maintained. Clinical operation of the system has been facilitated by automation of afferent and efferent functions including flushing of catheters, servo-calibration of pressure measuring systems, automated urine collection and disposal, and computer controlled infusion of fluids and medications. We anticipate the continuing development of automated afferent and efferent components for feedback control of ventilators by automated sampling and measurement of arterial blood gases and infusion of fluids and medications in response to changes in monitored hemodynamic variables. Such automation, together with medical intelligence for priority alarms and interpretive displays, hold promise of increasingly potent and cost-effective systems to facilitate and improve care of the critically ill or injured patient.

1046,1001846,Regulation of brittle diabetics by a pre-planned insulin infusion programme,"Eleven brittle diabetics, mean duration 11.5 years, all treated with highly purified porcine NPH insulin twice daily, were placed on highly purified porcine regular insulin 4 times daily for 2 days. Thereafter pre-planned intravenous insulin infusion was started. Insulin in an amount corresponding to the daily insulin requirement was infused by a mobile electric infusion pump at precalculated rates between 30 and 7 ml/hour during 2 days. The patients were ambulatory. Capillary blood glucose was taken every 30 min after meals and every two hours during the night. After an equilibration period of 7 hours, blood glucose fluctuations were in the physiological range in nearly all patients during the infusion period. [Only 1.3% of the blood samples showed glucose levels lower than 2.5 mmol/l and 2.9% levels exceeding 10.0 mmol/l during the infusion days]. Mean blood glucose (MBG) was 6.0 +/- 0.9 mmol/l (mean +/- s.d.), the standard deviation of MBG was 1.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, the mean amplitude of blood glucose excursions (MAGE) 4.7 +/- 1.4 mmol/l, and glucosuria 3.1 +/- 3.9 g/day. All these data of glucose  homeostasis were significantly lower during the infusion days. The incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks was low (0.32/patient/day) and not significantly higher than during NPH treatment. It is concluded that near normal blood glucose fluctuations can be achieved in brittle diabetics by preplanned insulin infusion without blood glucose monitoring. ",0
1047,12407596,Prevention and treatment of hepatitis C in injection drug users,"Injection drug users constitute the largest group of persons infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States, and most new infections occur in drug users. Controlling hepatitis C in the U.S. population, therefore, will require developing, testing, and implementing effective prevention and treatment strategies for persons who inject drugs. Fortunately, a substantial body of research and clinical experience exists on the prevention and management of chronic viral diseases among injection drug users. The need to implement interventions to stop the spread of HCV among drug users is critical. The capacity of substance-use treatment programs need to be expanded to accommodate all who want and need treatment. Physicians and pharmacists should be educated in how to provide access to sterile syringes and to teach safe injection techniques, both of which are lifesaving interventions. The treatment of hepatitis C in drug users requires an interdisciplinary approach that brings together expertise in treating hepatitis and caring for drug users. Treatment decisions should be made individually by patients with their physicians, based on a balanced assessment of risks and benefits and the patient's personal values. Physicians should carefully assess, monitor, and support adherence and mental health in all patients, regardless of whether drug use is known or suspected. Research is needed to better understand how best to prevent and treat hepatitis C in substance users. In the meantime, substantial progress can be made if existing knowledge and resources are brought to bear.",0
1048,17021318,Ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration,"BACKGROUND: Ranibizumab--a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody Fab that neutralizes all active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor A--has been evaluated for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: In this multicenter, 2-year, double-blind, sham-controlled study, we randomly assigned patients with age-related macular degeneration with either minimally classic or occult (with no classic lesions) choroidal neovascularization to receive 24 monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) or sham injections. The primary end point was the proportion of patients losing fewer than 15 letters from baseline visual acuity at 12 months. RESULTS: We enrolled 716 patients in the study. At 12 months, 94.5% of the group given 0.3 mg of ranibizumab and 94.6% of those given 0.5 mg lost fewer than 15 letters, as compared with 62.2% of patients receiving sham injections (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Visual acuity improved by 15 or more letters in 24.8% of the 0.3-mg group and 33.8% of the 0.5-mg group, as compared with 5.0% of the sham-injection group (P<0.001 for both doses). Mean increases in visual acuity were 6.5 letters in the 0.3-mg group and 7.2 letters in the 0.5-mg group, as compared with a decrease of 10.4 letters in the sham-injection group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The benefit in visual acuity was maintained at 24 months. During 24 months, presumed endophthalmitis was identified in five patients (1.0%) and serious uveitis in six patients (1.3%) given ranibizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal administration of ranibizumab for 2 years prevented vision loss and improved mean visual acuity, with low rates of serious adverse events, in patients with minimally classic or occult (with no classic lesions) choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration.

1049,24439348,"Vaccinations given during pregnancy, 2002-2009: a descriptive study","""A number of studies have described influenza vaccination coverage during pregnancy but few publications have described rates of other vaccinations. To describe vaccination rates during pregnancy in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), with particular focus on vaccinations contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancies ending in 2002 through 2009 and vaccinations administered during these pregnancies were identified in the VSD. Vaccination rates per 1000 pregnancies during the study period were calculated by vaccine type, recommendation category, pregnancy year, maternal age, and trimester. Analyses were conducted in 2012-2013. In the VSD, 669,695 pregnancies and 141,389 vaccinations were identified. Trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) was the most commonly administered vaccination (174.1 doses per 1000 pregnancies) and was most often administered during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The most common vaccines in the """"consider if indicated"""" category were tetanus-diphtheria (6.1 per 1000) and hepatitis B (3.7 per 1000). Contraindicated vaccination was infrequent, and the majority of these were measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) (1.2 per 1000); varicella (1.0 per 1000); and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (0.3 per 1000). Both """"consider if indicated"""" and contraindicated vaccines were more frequently administered during early pregnancy. TIV was the most commonly administered vaccine. With the exception of TIV, other vaccines were most frequently administered during early pregnancy and among younger women, suggesting that vaccination may occur when the woman and/or provider are unaware of the pregnancy. Contraindicated vaccines were infrequently administered during pregnancy; however, given that some women received contraindicated vaccines later in pregnancy, clearer recommendations and improved provider education may be needed.

Generally the reaction yielded mostly precipitates collected by 96-well filter plates. The best hit compound was found to be active and selective for Mdm4 (Ki=5 μM, 10-fold stronger than Mdm2). This initial hit may serve as the starting point for designing selective p53-Mdm4 inhibitor with higher affinity. ",0

We compared the efficacy and safety of 5 and 7 day courses of gemifloxacin for outpatient treatment of mild-moderate CAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study, patients were randomized to receive 320 mg of oral gemifloxacin once daily for 5 or 7 days. Over 95% of all patients in each cohort had a Fine score of <or=III. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at follow-up (days 24-30). Secondary outcomes were clinical and bacteriological responses at the end of therapy (days 7-9) and bacteriological and radiological responses at follow-up. Adverse events (AEs) were also monitored. RESULTS: In a total of 469 per protocol (PP) patients, clinical resolution at follow-up was 95% and 92% for 5 and 7 day treatments, respectively [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48, 7.42], indicating non-inferiority of 5 day treatment. Clinical resolution at the end of therapy was 96% for both regimens (95% CI -3.85, 3.42). Bacteriological response rates in PP patients at the end of therapy were 94% and 96% for 5 and 7 day groups, respectively (95% CI -8.27, 3.25) and 91% for both groups at follow-up (95% CI -6.89, 7.93). Radiological success in PP patients at follow-up was 98% and 93% in 5 and 7 day groups, respectively (95% CI 0.35, 7.91). Pre-therapy pathogens were identified in 242 (47.3%) patients, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Frequency of treatment-related AEs was 21% in both cohorts with discontinuation rates of 1.2% and 2% in the 5 and 7 day groups, respectively. A lower incidence of rash was observed in the 5 day cohort (0.4%) versus the 7 day cohort (2.8%) (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Gemifloxacin once daily for 5 days is not inferior to 7 days in the PP population with respect to clinical, bacteriological and radiological efficacy. Further work is needed, however, to explore whether fewer treatment days would improve patient compliance and reduce the incidence of AEs.",1
1054,22507491,The developing clinical problem of chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury,"Chemotherapy is being administered to an increasing number of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), whether they have resectable disease or not. Although this may be appropriate to downstage patients with unresectable disease, and offers theoretical advantages to those who have resectable disease, there is a price to be paid in the development of chemotherapy-induced hepatic injuries (CIHI). These include chemotherapy-associated fatty liver diseases and sinusoidal injuries. The main chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the adjuvant setting for colorectal carcinoma, and the neoadjuvant treatment of CRLM include 5-flurouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and while there are non-specific and overlapping injury profiles, oxaliplatin does appear to be primarily associated with sinusoidal injury and irinotecan with steatohepatitis. In this review, the rationale for administering chemotherapy to patients with CRLM is presented, and the problems this brings are outlined. The specific injury patterns will be detailed, as well as the data correlating specific chemotherapy regimens to these injury patterns. Finally, the clinical outcomes of patients with CRLM who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by hepatic resection will be considered. The need for methods to identify patients at risk of CIHI and to recognize established CIHI prior to surgery will be emphasized.",1

The Tacrine Study Group,"OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of tacrine hydrochloride with placebo in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. SETTING: Outpatients at 23 centers. PATIENTS: Men and women with probable Alzheimer's disease, at least 50 years old, mildly to moderately impaired, without other significant medical conditions. INTERVENTIONS: In the initial 6 weeks, patients received placebo, 20 mg/d of tacrine, or 40 mg/d of tacrine. In the second 6 weeks, half received the same treatment and half increased tacrine dose: those receiving placebo increased to 20 mg/d, those receiving 20 mg/d increased to 40 mg/d, and those receiving 40 mg/d increased to 80 mg/d. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive component and clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-eight patients entered. After 12 weeks, dose-related improvement was significant on the ADAS cognitive (P = .014), clinician-rated CGIC (P = .014), and caregiver-rated CGIC (P = .006). Comparison of 80 mg/d with placebo showed significant improvement on the ADAS cognitive (P = .015), clinician-rated CGIC (P = .016), and caregiver-rated CGIC (P = .028). Significant effects appeared as early as 6 weeks on the ADAS cognitive and caregiver-rated CGIC. Among patients receiving 80 mg/d of tacrine, 51% achieved a four-point or greater improvement of the ADAS cognitive component after 12 weeks of treatment. Reversible asymptomatic transaminase elevations greater than three times normal occurred in 25% of patients. Other treatment-related events included nausea and/or vomiting (8%), diarrhea (5%), abdominal pain (4%), dyspepsia (3%), and rash (3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the efficacy and safety of tacrine in some patients with Alzheimer's disease. After 12 weeks, the magnitude of the treatment effect is clinically important and recognized by the physician and caregiver.

METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease. We randomly assigned the patients to receive either ribociclib (600 mg per day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) plus letrozole (2.5 mg per day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, overall response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed on January 29, 2016, after 243 patients had disease progression or died. Prespecified criteria for superiority required a hazard ratio of 0.56 or less with P<1.29?10(-5). RESULTS: The duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P=3.29?10(-6) for superiority). The median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, the progression-free survival rate was 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6 to 70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8 to 49.5) in the placebo group. In patients with measurable disease at baseline, the overall response rate was 52.7% and 37.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were reported in more than 10% of the patients in either group were neutropenia (59.3% in the ribociclib group vs. 0.9% in the placebo group) and leukopenia (21.0% vs. 0.6%); the rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 7.5% and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients receiving initial systemic treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, the duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer among those receiving ribociclib plus letrozole than among those receiving placebo plus letrozole, with a higher rate of myelosuppression in the ribociclib group.

1057,15495253,Androgens and liver tumors: Fanconi's anemia and non-Fanconi's conditions,"""The association between anabolic androgenic steroids and liver tumors was first noted in patients with Fanconi's anemia (FA). The hypotheses which led to this review were as follows: (1) androgen-treated individuals who do not have FA are also at risk of liver tumors; (2) parenteral as well as oral androgens may be responsible for liver tumors; (3) FA patients develop liver tumors after smaller and briefer androgen exposure than non-FA individuals; (4) the risk of hepatic neoplasms may depend on the specific androgen. Medline and Web of Science were searched for all cases of liver tumors associated with androgens. Information from individual cases was entered into a spreadsheet and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Thirty-six FA cases and 97 non-FA cases with both nonhematologic disorders and acquired aplastic anemia (non-FA AA) were identified. The most common androgens were oxymetholone, methyltestosterone, and danazol. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were more often associated with oxymetholone and methyltestosterone, while adenomas were associated with danazol. Tumors were reported in six patients who received only parenteral and not oral androgens. FA patients were younger than non-FA patients when androgen use was initiated, and the FA patients developed tumors at younger ages. Non-AA patients were treated with androgens for longer periods of time, compared with FA and non-FA AA patients. All patients on anabolic androgenic steroids are at risk of liver tumors, regardless of underlying diagnosis. The magnitude of the risk cannot be determined from currently available data, because the number of patients receiving androgens is unknown.""",1
1058,10066203,Efficacy and safety of rivastigmine in patients with Alzheimer's disease: international randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of rivastigmine on the core domains of Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial. Patients received either placebo, 1-4 mg/day (lower dose) rivastigmine, or 6-12 mg/day (higher dose) rivastigmine. Doses were increased in one of two fixed dose ranges (1-4 mg/day or 6-12 mg/day) over the first 12 weeks with a subsequent assessment period of 14 weeks. SETTING: 45 centres in Europe and North America. PARTICIPANTS: 725 patients with mild to moderately severe probable Alzheimer's disease diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, and the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale, rating on the clinician interview based impression of change incorporating caregiver information scale, and the progressive deterioration scale. RESULTS: At the end of the study cognitive function had deteriorated among those in the placebo group. Scores on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale improved in patients in the higher dose group when compared with patients taking placebo (P<0.05). Significantly more patients in the higher dose group had improved by 4 points or more than had improved in the placebo group (24% (57/242) v 16% (39/238)). Global function as rated by the clinician interview scale had significantly improved among those in the higher dose group compared with those taking placebo (P<0.001), and significantly more patients in the higher dose group showed improvement than did in the placebo group (37% (80/219) v 20% (46/230)). Mean scores on the progressive deterioration scale improved from baseline in patients in the higher dose group but fell in the placebo group. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, of mild to moderate severity, transient, and occurred mainly during escalation of the dose. 23% (55/242) of those in the higher dose group, 7% (18/242) of those in the lower dose group, and 7% (16/239) of those in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine is well tolerated and effective. It improves cognition, participation in activities of daily living, and global evaluation ratings in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. This is the first treatment to show compelling evidence of efficacy in a predominantly European population.",1
1059,21596364,Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe added on to rosuvastatin 5 or 10 mg versus up-titration of rosuvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia (the ACTE Study),"""The present multicenter, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe (10 mg) added to stable rosuvastatin therapy versus up-titration of rosuvastatin from 5 to 10 mg or from 10 to 20 mg. The study population included 440 subjects at moderately high/high risk of coronary heart disease with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels higher than the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations (<100 mg/dl for moderately high/high-risk subjects without atherosclerotic vascular disease or <70 mg/dl for high-risk subjects with atherosclerotic vascular disease). Pooled data demonstrated that ezetimibe added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 21%. In contrast, doubling rosuvastatin to 10 mg or 20 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 5.7% (between-group difference of 15.2%, p <0.001). Individually, ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 5 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 10 mg (12.3% difference, p <0.001), and ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 20 mg (17.5% difference, p <0.001). Compared to rosuvastatin up-titration, ezetimibe add-on achieved significantly greater attainment of LDL cholesterol levels of <70 or <100 mg/dl (59.4% vs 30.9%, p <0.001), and <70 mg/dl in all subjects (43.8% vs 17.5%, p <0.001); produced significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (p <0.001); and resulted in similar effects on other lipid parameters. Adverse experiences were generally comparable among the groups. In conclusion, compared to up-titration doubling of the rosuvastatin dose, ezetimibe 10 mg added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg produced greater improvements in many lipid parameters and achieved greater attainment of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommended LDL cholesterol targets in subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol and at moderately high/high coronary heart disease risk.""",1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used data from the FRENA Registry to compare the clinical outcome in stable outpatients with intermittent claudication, according to the use of cilostazol. RESULTS: As of January 2013, 1,317 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited in FRENA, of whom 191 (14.5%) received cilostazol. Over a mean follow-up of 18months, 39 patients developed myocardial infarction, 23 ischemic stroke, 20 underwent limb amputation, 15 had major bleeding and 70 died. There were no significant differences in the rate of subsequent ischemic events, major bleeding or death between patients receiving or not receiving cilostazol. On multivariate analysis, the use of cilostazol had no influence on the risk for subsequent myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.33-20.8), ischemic stroke (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.48-4.43), limb amputation (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.04-20.6), major bleeding (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.33-7.09) or death (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.40-20.0).

1062,18329912,Structural effects of sodium hypochlorite solution on RaCe rotary nickel-titanium instruments: an atomic force microscopy study,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium hypochlorite immersion on the surface characteristics of RaCe rotary nickel-titanium instruments using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Four new RaCe instruments were used in this study (two 30.06 and two 30.02). One 30.06 and one 30.02 instrument were immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min. Surface topography of the instruments was evaluated using the AFM. The instruments were analyzed on 11 points along a 3-mm section. Root mean square (RMS) values were used to compare the topographic deviations. The data were analyzed using Student t test. Mean RMS values for NaOCl measurements were higher than the measurements on new files, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .01). The AFM results show that NaOCl causes deterioration on the surface of RaCe instruments and should be used with care during clinical use because of the risk of unexpected failure. ",0

The gallbladders were not removed at the time of pump implantation in the initial six patients. In these patients, chemotherapy consisted of floxuridine given every 2 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period and cisplatin over 1 hour by way of the side portal on day 8 of the cycle. The treatment was repeated every 28 days. All patients whose gallbladders were not removed at the time of pump implantation required reoperation for acute or chronic acalculous cholecystitis from 1 to 9 months (mean 5.4 months) after pump implantation. At operation, all patients were found to have various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. In one patient, significant sclerosing cholangitis was documented that involved the entire intrahepatic ductal system and hepatic duct bifurcation. Cholecystectomy and operative cholangiography are recommended in all patients who undergo pump implantation for metastatic disease to the liver.",1
1064,16507650,"Contrary to adult, neonatal rats show pronounced brain uptake of corticosteroids","Neurotoxic adverse effects after systemic corticosteroid administration are elevated in preterm infants. To test whether this might be related to an immature blood-brain barrier (BBB) that permits corticosteroids to enter the brain and induce neurotoxic effects, this study assessed the differences in brain permeability of triamcinolone acetonide after intratracheal administration to neonatal (10- to 11-day-old) and adult rats. Triamcinolone acetonide (or the phosphate prodrug in the case of neonatal rats) was administered intratracheally to neonatal rats at doses of 2.5, 25, or 50 microg/kg and to adult rats at 100 microg/kg. An ex vivo receptor binding assay was used to monitor the cumulative brain and liver glucocorticoid receptor occupancies over 6 h. Brain and liver receptor occupancies in neonates were similar for the 25 and 50 microg/kg triamcinolone acetonide phosphate (brain/liver receptor occupancy ratio, 1.10 +/- 0.14 and 0.87 +/- 0.13, respectively), whereas some reduction in the brain permeability was seen at the lower dose. After intratracheal administration of 100 microg/kg triamcinolone acetonide to adult rats, receptor occupancies in the brain were significantly lower (brain/liver ratio, 0.21 +/- 0.14; p < 0.001). The study demonstrated that glucocorticoids enter the brain of neonatal rats because of an immature BBB. The results of this study support the hypothesis that neurotoxic adverse effects in preterm infants after systemic corticosteroid administration might be related to an immature BBB. ",0
1065,3871563,Increased hepatic density and phospholipidosis due to amiodarone,"Amiodarone is an amphiphilic iodinated compound that is used as a treatment for refractory ventricular arrhythmias. During evaluation for possible pulmonary toxicity, a patient receiving amiodarone was noted to have an increase in the density of his liver as seen on computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen. Six additional patients who were receiving amiodarone were subsequently evaluated to ascertain the frequency of this finding. The CT density of the liver was increased in all patients. Values obtained varied from 95 to 145 H, with a mean of 117 +/- 8.9 (normal, 30-70). The alkaline phosphatase was elevated in four patients, but only one had an elevation of either the alanine or aspartate aminotransferase. Two patients underwent liver biopsies, and both revealed membranous lamellar phospholipid-containing structures within hepatocytes. Animal studies done to recreate these findings revealed that amiodarone accumulated in the liver at concentrations 175-500 times greater than those found in serum. Quantitative measurements of iodine in samples from the same liver showed that the iodine levels were correspondingly elevated. In the treated animals, there was a small but statistically significant increase in the CT density of the liver, whereas the values for untreated animals were unchanged. Treatment with amiodarone leads to an accumulation in the liver of this iodinated compound and hence an increase in the CT density of the liver. This accumulation of the drug in hepatic lysosomes apparently causes a secondary phospholipidosis.",1
1066,10378809,Acalculous gallbladder pain: a largely unrecognised entity,"To study the presentation for and outcome of cholecystectomy in patients with acalculous gallbladder pain. Sixty-six consecutive patients with prospective documentation underwent cholecystectomy for putative acalculous gallbladder pain between December 1988 to April 1995. The diagnosis was made on clinical grounds, but in the majority, a CCK oral cholecystogram was performed. Outcomes were assessed by postal questionnaire mailed in October 1995 or by the last recorded follow- up. Fifty-eight females and eight males, with a median age of 37.5 years had experienced abdominal pain, usually with associated nausea, for a median of three years. Preoperative investigations were non-contributory, with the exception of the CCK oral cholecystogram which was regarded as abnormal in all instances. At a median follow-up of 40 months, 48 patients (72.7%) described their symptoms as either totally relieved or much improved by cholecystectomy. Though the pathophysiology remains poorly understood, there is clearly a group of patients who suffer from gallbladder pain in the absence of gallstones and who benefit from cholecystectomy. ",0
1067,8675188,Evidence that interference with binding to hepatic cytosol binders can inhibit bile acid excretion in rats,"We previously identified that Y' bile acid binders (3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases) interact with bile acids in intact rat hepatocytes using [3beta-3H, C24-14C]bile acids and that indomethacin, a competitive inhibitor of 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, inhibits 3H-loss from the C3-position of bile acids as well as inhibits hepatic bile acid removal and excretion. To study the kinetics of these inhibitory effects, glycocholate transport was studied in the absence and presence of indomethacin in the single-pass perfused rat liver. Indomethacin decreased net hepatic glycocholate uptake in the perfused liver, which was confirmed in isolated hepatocytes and basolateral liver plasma membrane vesicles. However, indomethacin markedly increased the sinusoidal efflux and decreased the biliary excretion of glycocholate in the perfused liver. These observations indicate that the effect of indomethacin to delay biliary glycocholate excretion is related to either intracellular or canalicular glycocholate transport. The latter possibility seemed unlikely because indomethacin did not inhibit electrogenic or adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent glycocholate uptake by canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles. Thus, the current data support an important role for binding of bile acids to cytosolic proteins in overall hepatic transport and suggest that specific interference with cytosolic binding can interfere with the excretion of bile acids.",0

Of these, 181 patients served as a control group in the first year and received rh-EPO therapy in the second year. Of the 837 adverse events that occurred, 277 were classified as serious and 560 as nonserious. Thirty-two deaths have been reported for the study population: 18 in the control group and 14 in the therapy group. The individual analysis of the serious adverse events including death demonstrates a protective effect of rh-EPO on the high-risk cardiovascular situation of dialysis patients. Hypertension was no problem, and under rh-EPO therapy an increase in resistance to infection was observed. Subcutaneous rh-EPO treatment might have an even better safety profile than intravenous application.",1

In case of acute or subacute hepatitis, liver failure may occur in about one third. We report two further cases of PTU-induced subacute hepatitis, in whom the delay between occurrence of liver damage after the initiation of treatment, the underestimation of its severity and the delayed withdrawal of the drug were all likely responsible for liver failure. The high incidence of liver toxicity related to PTU, its potential severity and delayed occurrence after initiation of treatment are in favor of monthly alanine aminotransferase monitoring, at least during the first six months of therapy.",1

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of raltegravir when added to optimised background regimens in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: HIV-infected patients with HIV-1 RNA viral load over 5000 copies per mL, CD4 cell counts over 50 cells per muL, and documented genotypic and phenotypic resistance to at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and one protease inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive raltegravir (200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg) or placebo orally twice daily in this multicentre, triple-blind, dose-ranging, randomised study. The primary endpoints were change in viral load from baseline at week 24 and safety. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with the number NCT00105157. FINDINGS: 179 patients were eligible for randomisation. 44 patients were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg raltegravir, 45 to receive 400 mg raltegravir, and 45 to receive 600 mg raltegravir; 45 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo. One patient in the 200 mg group did not receive treatment and was therefore excluded from the analyses. For all groups, the median duration of previous antiretroviral therapy was 9.9 years (range 0.4-17.3 years) and the mean baseline viral load was 4.7 (SD 0.5) log10 copies per mL. Four patients discontinued due to adverse experiences, three (2%) of the 133 patients across all raltegravir groups and one (2%) of the 45 patients on placebo. 41 patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy: 14 (11%) of the 133 patients across all raltegravir groups and 27 (60%) of the 45 patients on placebo. At week 24, mean change in viral load from baseline was -1.80 (95% CI -2.10 to -1.50) log10 copies per mL in the 200 mg group, -1.87 (-2.16 to -1.58) log10 copies per mL in the 400 mg group, -1.84 (-2.10 to -1.58) log10 copies per mL in the 600 mg group, and -0.35 (-0.61 to -0.09) log(10) copies per mL for the placebo group. Raltegravir at all doses showed a safety profile much the same as placebo; there were no dose-related toxicities. INTERPRETATION: In patients with few remaining treatment options, raltegravir at all doses studied provided better viral suppression than placebo when added to an optimised background regimen. The safety profile of raltegravir is comparable with that of placebo at all doses studied.""",1
1072,24984657,A study on mast cell number and lipid profile in oral submucous fibrosis,"Prevention of oral precancer is most desirable and should take precedence over its diagnosis and therapy. As both, mast cell counts in connective tissue and serum lipids are altered in Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF), so study of both the factors is vitally important in OSF. A total of 50 persons were included in the study of which 40 were OSF patients and 10 controls. Tissue sections and blood samples were collected for mast cell count and lipid profile estimation for both OSF patients and controls. Mean mast cells in all grades of OSF were higher as compared to apparently normal appearing oral mucosa but as severity of OSF increases (from Grade II to Grade IV), count of Mast cell decreases. Further, the mean mast cells in OSF Grade II, III and IV groups were found 95.5%, 93.8% and 92.2% higher respectively as compared to normal (highly significant for all the groups p<0.001). The mean serum lipid profile of OSF groups was comparatively lower than age and sex matched healthy controls but was highly significant for all the groups (p<0.001). Thus, it can be said that in the present study serum lipid profile decreases in OSF patients and mast cell count is increased when compared with apparently normal appearing mucosa but with the advancement of the grades mast cell number decreases in tissue sections of OSF. It can be suggested that biochemical and histological assessment of OSF patients may help in earlier diagnosis and/or prognosis of this disease. ",0

1076,18317442,Neuroimaging for the pediatric endocrinologist,"Imaging of the sella and surrounding structures has become essential in the evaluation of pituitary dysfunction and its causes. This article begins with a review of the normal anatomy of the sella and the imaging patterns in and about the normal pituitary gland. There exists considerable variability in the size and configuration of the normal gland in all age groups, and absolute determination of a 'large' or 'small' gland can prove difficult and problematic. Absence of the posterior bright-spot may indicate disruption of the normal stalk transport mechanisms. Microadenomas are well-resolved by magnetic resonance imaging as areas with reduced or delayed enhancement relative to the normal gland. Among hormonally active tumors, adrenocorticotropic hormone-releasing adenomas are most common in the first 11 years of life, while prolactinomas become more common into the teenage years. Macroadenomas tend to present clinically because of mass-effect on adjacent structures, such as the bitemporal hemianopsia seen with optic chiasm compression. Cystic lesions such as Rathke's cleft cysts are commonly seen in the gland, even in healthy children, and their presence need not correlate with any functional abnormality; however, such cysts can cause mass effect on the remaining gland, reflect hemorrhage into adenoma, or actually comprise the central portion of a more worrisome tumor such as craniopharyngioma. Solid tumors of the suprasellar region include optic pathway gliomas, hamartomas, and germinomas. Among inflammatory conditions, granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis have predilection for involvement of the suprasellar regions and can spread along perivascular spaces deep within the parenchyma. Because of the association of pituitary endocrinopathies with midline anomalies, one should pay careful attention to midline structures included on a sellar survey. ",0
1077,8188173,Renin and angiotensinogen mRNA expression in the kidneys of rats subjected to long-term bile duct ligation,"Activation of antinatriuretic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, is of major importance in the pathogenesis of sodium retention in cirrhosis. In this study, we studied the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system by measuring renin and angiotensinogen mRNA expression in the kidney of rats subjected to long-term bile duct ligation in a phase before the development of ascites, when sodium retention is already present. Experiments were performed in sham-operated and bile duct-ligated rats 3 wk after surgery. Balance studies showed lower sodium excretion and greater sodium retention in the bile duct-ligated rats compared with the control animals. Plasma renin activity (4.41 +/- 1.01 ng Angiotensin I/ml/hr in the bile duct-ligated group vs. 4.20 +/- 0.74 in the controls) and plasma renin concentration were not different between the two groups. However, plasma renin substrate was significantly decreased in bile duct-ligated animals. Total kidney renin mRNA was significantly higher in the bile duct-ligated animals (0.83 +/- 0.14 densitometric units vs. 0.44 +/- 0.04 in the controls), as determined on Northern-blot analysis and densitometric quantitation. Angiotensinogen mRNA expression in the kidneys of bile duct-ligated rats was significantly decreased (0.09 +/- 0.01 densitometric units) compared with that of the controls (0.21 +/- 0.03). These results indicate that sodium-retaining, nonascitic bile duct-ligated rats show abnormalities of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system that precede changes in plasma renin activity. Our data suggest that the intrarenal renin angiotensin system may participate in the initiation of the renal pathophysiological abnormalities present in bile duct-ligated rats.",0
1078,11932474,Understanding the treatment preferences of seriously ill patients,"BACKGROUND: The questions patients are asked about their preferences with regard to life-sustaining treatment usually focus on specific interventions, but the outcomes of treatment and their likelihood affect patients' preferences. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire about treatment preferences to 226 persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had a limited life expectancy due to cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study participants were asked whether they would want to receive a given treatment, first when the outcome was known with certainty and then with different likelihoods of an adverse outcome. The outcome without treatment was specified as death from the underlying disease. RESULTS: The burden of treatment (i.e., the length of the hospital stay, extent of testing, and invasiveness of interventions), the outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome all influenced treatment preferences. For a low-burden treatment with the restoration of current health, 98.7 percent of participants said they would choose to receive the treatment (rather than not receive it and die), but 11.2 percent of these participants would not choose the treatment if it had a high burden. If the outcome was survival but with severe functional impairment or cognitive impairment, 74.4 percent and 88.8 percent of these participants, respectively, would not choose treatment. The number of participants who said they would choose treatment declined as the likelihood of an adverse outcome increased, with fewer participants choosing treatment when the possible outcome was functional or cognitive impairment than when it was death. Preferences did not differ according to the primary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Advance care planning should take into account patients' attitudes toward the burden of treatment, the possible outcomes, and their likelihood. The likelihood of adverse functional and cognitive outcomes of treatment requires explicit consideration.",0
1079,18398081,Omega-3 free fatty acids for the maintenance of remission in Crohn disease: the EPIC Randomized Controlled Trials,"""CONTEXT: Maintenance therapy for Crohn disease features the use of immunosuppressive drugs, which are associated with an increased risk of infection. Identification of safe and effective maintenance strategies is a priority. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the oral administration of omega-3 free fatty acids is more effective than placebo for prevention of relapse of Crohn disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Epanova Program in Crohn's Study 1 [EPIC-1] and EPIC-2) conducted between January 2003 and February 2007 at 98 centers in Canada, Europe, Israel, and the United States. Data from 363 and 375 patients with quiescent Crohn disease were evaluated in EPIC-1 and EPIC-2, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than 150 were randomly assigned to receive either 4 g/d of omega-3 free fatty acids or placebo for up to 58 weeks. No other treatments for Crohn disease were permitted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical relapse, as defined by a CDAI score of 150 points or greater and an increase of more than 70 points from the baseline value, or initiation of treatment for active Crohn disease. RESULTS: For EPIC-1, 188 patients were assigned to receive omega-3 free fatty acids and 186 patients to receive placebo. Corresponding numbers for EPIC-2 were 189 and 190 patients, respectively. The rate of relapse at 1 year in EPIC-1 was 31.6% in patients who received omega-3 free fatty acids and 35.7% in those who received placebo (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.19; P = .30). Corresponding values for EPIC-2 were 47.8% and 48.8% (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.21; P = .48). Serious adverse events were uncommon and mostly related to Crohn disease. CONCLUSION: In these trials, treatment with omega-3 free fatty acids was not effective for the prevention of relapse in Crohn disease.

1080,3263401,Treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin),"2'-Deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, was administered to three patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma refractory to multiple treatment modalities. Patient 1, who received 5 mg/m2/day for 3 days at 35- to 71-day intervals, has achieved a complete remission greater than 16 months in duration. Patient 2 had progressive disease despite two courses of 2'-deoxycoformycin at a dose of 5 mg/m2/day for 3 days at 28-day intervals. The third patient, who was treated with 4 mg/m2 2'-deoxycoformycin weekly to biweekly, had an initial response, but the disease progressed after eight treatments. Only one patient had any side effects: Patient 1 developed reversible episcleritis, mild elevation of liver enzymes, and persistent nausea and vomiting. In red blood cells of all patients, there was near complete inhibition of adenosine deaminase (91% to 96%) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (89% to 95%) activities with treatment. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, adenosine deaminase was inhibited by 85% to 98% and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase by 51% to 88%. The deoxyadenosine triphosphate level, reflected by the total cellular adenine deoxyribonucleotide measurement in erythrocytes, was noted to be modestly elevated during treatment, with the highest level in the patient who demonstrated the only complete response and the only toxic effects. Low-dose 2'-deoxycoformycin appears to be safe but may be an insufficiently intensive regimen to treat refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma. With proper biochemical monitoring, higher doses may be both safe and more effective.",1
1081,3491317,Endoscopic sclerotherapy versus portacaval shunt in patients with severe cirrhosis and acute variceal hemorrhage. Long-term follow-up,"In a continuation of a trial for which preliminary results were reported in the Journal two years ago, a total of 64 patients with Child Class C cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage requiring six or more units of blood were randomly assigned to receive either a portacaval shunt (32 patients) or endoscopic sclerotherapy (32 patients). The duration of initial hospitalization and the total amount of blood transfused during hospitalization were significantly less in the patients receiving sclerotherapy (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in short-term survival (50 percent of the sclerotherapy group were discharged alive, as compared with 44 percent of the shunt-surgery group). Both groups were followed for a mean of 530 days after randomization. Rebleeding from varices, the duration of rehospitalization for hemorrhage, and transfusions received after discharge were all significantly greater in the sclerotherapy group (P less than 0.001). Forty percent of the sclerotherapy-treated patients discharged alive (7 of 16 patients) ultimately required surgical treatment for bleeding varices, despite a mean of 6.1 treatment sessions. Health care costs and long-term survival did not differ significantly between the groups (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that although endoscopic sclerotherapy is as good as surgical shunting for the acute management of variceal hemorrhage in poor-risk patients with massive bleeding, sclerotherapy-treated patients in whom varices are not obliterated and bleeding continues should be considered for elective shunt surgery.",0
1082,7002704,An analysis of hepatic venocclusive disease and centrilobular hepatic degeneration following bone marrow transplantation,"In order to assess the prevalence of venocclusive disease in autopsied recipients of bone marrow transplantation, we reviewed coded liver histology from 204 consecutive autopsied recipients transplanted for leukemia (142), other malignancies (5), or aplastic anemia (57). Twenty-seven patients with leukemia, 2 with carcinoma, and 3 with aplasia had venocclusive disease and survived 2-86 days post-transplant. Early lesions showed subintimal edema and hemorrhage within small central venules and centrilobular congestion with hepatocyte degeneration. Later lesions showed subtotal to complete fibrous obliteration of the central venule lumina and centrilobular sinusoidal fibrosis. Thirteen patients had a subclinical course, and 19 were symptomatic. Venocclusive disease was life-threatening or lethal in 13. Typical symptoms developed 1-3 wk post-transplant and consisted of sudden weight gain, hepatic enlargement, ascites, high bilirubin, and encephalopathy. Statistical analyses showed a significantly higher prevalence of venocclusive disease associated with transplantation for leukemia (P = 0.014), pretransplant conditioning with more rigorous chemoradiotherapy regimens (P < 0.001) and three- to fourfold increase of venocclusive disease in patients whose conditioning included dimethyl busulfan (P < 0.005). Abnormal liver tests before transplant were also more prevalent among patients with venocclusive disease. No factors predicted the clinical outcome of established venocclusive disease. Venocclusive disease showed no association with hepatic graft-versus-host disease even among prolonged cases with severe periportal hepatitis and cholestasis. Other centrilobular lesions (hepatocyte degeneration, sinusoidal fibrosis, and phlebosclerosis) were identified in 23 patients. These non-specific changes may occur with viral hepatitis, graft-versus-host disease or chemoradiotherapy effects.",1
1083,29906750,"Naringenin attenuates behavioral derangements induced by social defeat stress in mice via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","The effects of naringenin; a dietary flavonoid, with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities on social defeat stress (SDS)-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical changes were evaluated in mice using resident-intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were distributed into 6 groups (n = 6). Mice in group 1 (control) received vehicle (3% DMSO, i.p), group 2 (SDS-control) were also given vehicle, groups 3-5 received naringenin (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) while group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p) daily for 14 days. However, 30 min after treatment on day 7, mice in groups 2-6 were exposed to SDS for a period of 10 min confrontation with aggressive counterparts for 7 consecutive days. Neurobehavioral phenotypes: spontaneous motor activity (SMA), memory, anxiety and depression were then evaluated on day 14. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were then estimated in the brain tissues. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) were also determined. SDS-induced neurobehavioral deficits were significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated by naringenin. The increased brain level of MDA (13.00 ± 0.63 μmol/g tissue) relative to vehicle-control (6.50 ± 0.43 μmol/g tissue) was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced to 5.50 ± 0.22 μmol/g tissue by naringenin (50 mg/kg). Mice exposed to SDS had decreased brain GSH level (5.17 ± 0.40 μmol/g tissue) relative to control (11.67 ± 0.84 μmol/g tissue). However, naringenin (50 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) elevated GSH content (13.33 ± 0.88 μmol/g tissue) in the brains of SDS-mice. Moreover, 50 mg/Kg of naringenin (38.13 ± 2.38 ρg/mL) attenuated (p < 0.05) increased TNF-α level when compared with SDS (49.69 ± 2.81 ρg/mL). SDS-induced increase in brain level of IL-1β (236.5 ± 6.92 ρg/mL) was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by naringenin (219.90 ± 15.25 ρg/mL). Naringenin also elevated antioxidant enzymes and decreased AChE activity in the brains of mice exposed to SDS (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that naringenin attenuates SDS-induced neurobehavioral deficits through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a colonoscopy-trained, military family physician (FP) saved health care dollars at an ACH by decreasing outside referrals. We present a chart review of all 182 colonoscopies performed by a FP at an ACH from September 2003 to May 2005. The total facility cost was determined using the cost of personnel, lost clinic hours, equipment, supplies, medications, continuing medical education, missed diagnoses, procedure complications, and need for additional studies. The potential referral cost was determined using local civilian colonoscopy billing codes and TRICARE reimbursement rates for 2004. The total facility cost was $53,517.14 ($294.05 per colonoscopy). The total referral cost would have been $156,197.60 ($858.23 per colonoscopy). Using a FP saved the hospital $102,680.46 ($564.18 per colonoscopy). A colonoscopy-trained FP saved significant health care dollars at an ACH. ",0
1089,7739683,Calcium-channel antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome and other paraneoplastic syndromes,"BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated calcium channels in small-cell lung carcinomas may initiate autoimmunity in the paraneoplastic neuromuscular disorder Lambert-Eaton syndrome. The calcium-channel subtype that is responsible is not known. METHODS: We compared the effects of antagonists of L-type, N-type, and P/Q-type neuronal calcium channels on the depolarization-dependent influx of calcium-45 in cultured carcinoma cells. Serum samples from patients with various disorders were tested for reactivity with P/Q-type channels solubilized from carcinoma and cerebellar membranes and N-type channels from cerebral cortex. RESULTS: P/Q-type calcium-channel antagonists were the most potent inhibitors of depolarization-induced 45Ca influx in cultured small-cell carcinoma cell lines. Anti-P/Q-type calcium-channel antibodies were found in serum from all 32 patients with Lambert-Eaton syndrome and a diagnosis of cancer and in 91 percent of the 33 patients with Lambert-Eaton syndrome without cancer. Anti-N-type calcium-channel antibodies were found in 49 percent of the 65 patients with the Lambert-Eaton Syndrome. Lower titers of anti-P/Q-type and anti-N-type calcium-channel antibodies were found in 54 percent of 70 patients with a paraneoplastic encephalomyeloneuropathic complication of lung, ovarian, or breast carcinoma, 24 percent of 90 patients with cancer but no evident neurologic complications, 23 percent of 78 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and less than 3 percent of 69 patients with myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, or scleroderma. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of P/Q-type calcium-channel antibodies found in patients with Lambert-Eaton syndrome implies that antibodies of this specificity have a role in the presynaptic pathophysiology of this disorder.",0
1090,19474428,Inactivating PAPSS2 mutations in a patient with premature pubarche,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfotransferase, known as SULT2A1, converts the androgen precursor DHEA to its inactive sulfate ester, DHEAS [corrected], thereby preventing the conversion of DHEA to an active androgen. SULT2A1 requires 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) for catalytic activity. We have identified compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding human PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2) in a girl with premature pubarche, hyperandrogenic anovulation, very low DHEAS levels, and increased androgen levels. In vitro coincubation of human SULT2A1 and wild-type or mutant PAPSS2 proteins confirmed the inactivating nature of the mutations. These observations indicate that PAPSS2 deficiency is a monogenic adrenocortical cause of androgen excess.",0
1091,10364294,Use of major histocompatibility complex class I/peptide/beta2M tetramers to quantitate CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for dominant and nondominant viral epitopes in simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys,"To evaluate the impact of the diversity of antigen recognition by T lymphocytes on disease pathogenesis, we must be able to identify and analyze simultaneously cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses specific for multiple viral epitopes. Many of the studies of the role of CD8(+) CTLs in AIDS pathogenesis have been done with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)- and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus monkeys. These studies have frequently made use of the well-defined SIV Gag CTL epitope p11C,C-M presented to CTL by the HLA-A homologue molecule Mamu-A*01. In the present study we identified and fine mapped two novel Mamu-A*01-restricted CTL epitopes: the SIVmac Pol-derived epitope p68A (STPPLVRLV) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env-derived p41A epitope (YAPPISGQI). The frequency of CD8(+) CTLs specific for the p11C,C-M, p68A, and p41A epitopes was quantitated in the same animals with a panel of tetrameric Mamu-A*01/peptide/beta2m complexes. All SHIV-infected Mamu-A*01(+) rhesus monkeys tested had a high frequency of SIVmac Gag-specific CTLs to the p11C,C-M epitope. In contrast, only a fraction of the monkeys tested had detectable CTLs specific for the SIVmac Pol p68A and HIV-1 Env p41A epitopes, and these responses were detected at very low frequencies. Thus, the p11C,C-M-specific CD8(+) CTL response is dominant and the p41A- and p68A-specific CD8(+) CTL responses are nondominant. These results indicate that CD8(+) CTL responses to dominant CTL epitopes can be readily quantitated with the tetramer technology; however, CD8(+) CTL responses to nondominant epitopes, due to the low frequency of these epitope-specific cells, may be difficult to detect and quantitate by this approach.

The Chinese system is engaged in a vigorous program to solve health-manpower needs in the rural areas by emphasizing de-professionalization, mass orientation and accountability to the community. Among the notable changes within the medical schools are the following: an admission process favoring the recruitment of peasants, factory workers, and the military; a three-year program with heavy emphasis on practicing in rural communities; widespread integration of the traditional Chinese and Western systems of medical practice; and manual labor and political seminars, which compose more than 25 per cent of the required curriculum. These innovations have been greatly facilitated by a strong national commitment and supportive political system. The fact that less than 10 per cent of doctors in China today are graduates of college-level medical education indicates the importance of other entry possibilities.",0

1095,23833416,Etiology and significance of incidentally detected focal colonic uptake on FDG PET/CT,"Incidental colonic uptake of 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) is not an infrequent finding encountered during whole body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Almost all studies on this topic are in Western populations, which have a markedly different epidemiological profile for colorectal premalignant and malignant conditions as compared to that of the Indian subcontinent. The purpose of this study was to assess the etiology of incidentally detected focal FDG uptake in the colon by comparing it with colonoscopy and histopathology. Electronic medical records of patients who underwent FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) at our institution for a 2½-year period from January 2009 to July 2011 were reviewed. There were 32 out of 9000 (0.35%) patients whose PET/CT reports mentioned incidental focal colonic FDG uptake, of which 24 patients subsequently underwent colonoscopy. Lesions which appeared neoplastic on colonoscopy were confirmed with histopathology obtained after biopsy or surgery. Colonoscopy and pathology findings were considered as gold standard. Among the 24 patients who underwent a colonoscopy, 3 patients had normal findings (12.5%). A positive colonoscopy was noted in 21 patients (87.5%) with the lesion coinciding with the location described in the PET/CT report. Adenomatous polyps were detected in 12 patients (37.5%), whereas in 8 patients (25%) malignant lesions were confirmed [adenocarcinoma n = 5, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) n = 2, malignant melanoma n = 1]. In one patient, colonic uptake was diagnosed as inflammatory. The mean standardized uptake valuemax (SUVmax) for the 12 premalignant lesions was 16.9 ± 9.6 (range 7.5-37.4) and the mean SUVmax for the 8 malignant lesions was 12.9 ± 5.5 (range 6.7-21.6). The difference in SUVmax between the premalignant adenomatous polyps and the malignant lesions was not statistically significant (P = 0.316). Our study shows that a significant proportion of patients (62.5%, 20/32) showing an incidental focal FDG uptake will harbor premalignant (adenomatous polyps) or malignant lesions, and further evaluation with colonoscopy and biopsy is warranted in such cases.

1096,29781780,Physical Therapists Know Function: An Opinion on Mobility and Level of Activity During Hospitalization for Adult Inpatients,"Negative consequences of immobility during hospitalization are widely known and remain undisputed. Evidence of low mobility for general medicine adult inpatients persists. Patients who experience hospital acquired functional decline due to low mobility require costly post-acute care services. The impact of immobility on post-acute care physical function and quality of life is directly at odds with value-based care. New Medicare payment models emphasize value-based care to promote care improvement and better patient outcomes. Quality improvement projects show promise in changing clinical practice using clinical champions, interprofessional collaboration, and teamwork. Physical therapists have a distinct expertise acutely focused on mobility and physical activity during hospitalization. Patients need acute care team members to develop sustainable clinical practice changes and to accept collective responsibility for a culture of mobility. Partnering with physical therapists and using their expertise to direct mobility, executed by the appropriate support personnel, can achieve the Quadruple Aim. ",0

1098,8015572,The economic impact of multiple-gestation pregnancies and the contribution of assisted-reproduction techniques to their incidence,"BACKGROUND: Although the medical complications associated with multiple-gestation pregnancies have been well documented, little is known about the effects of such pregnancies on the use of health care resources and the associated costs. This is an important issue because of the increasing use of assisted-reproduction techniques, which commonly result in multiple-gestation pregnancies. METHODS: We determined hospital charges and the use of assisted-reproduction techniques (such as induction of ovulation, in vitro fertilization, and gamete intrafallopian transfer) for 13,206 pregnant women (11,986 with singleton pregnancies, 1135 with twin pregnancies, and 85 with more than two fetuses) who were admitted for delivery to Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, in 1986 through 1991 and their 14,033 neonates (11,671 singletons, 2144 twins, and 218 resulting from higher-order multiple gestations). RESULTS: After we controlled for variables known to affect hospital charges, the predicted total charges to the family in 1991 for a singleton delivery were $9,845, as compared with $37,947 for twins ($18,974 per baby) and $109,765 for triplets ($36,588 per baby). Assisted-reproduction techniques were used in 2 percent of singleton, 35 percent of twin, and 77 percent of higher-order multiple-gestation pregnancies; such procedures were approximately equally divided between induction of ovulation alone and in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-gestation pregnancies, a high proportion of which result from the use of assisted-reproduction techniques, dramatically increase hospital charges. If all the multiple gestations resulting from assisted-reproduction techniques, dramatically increase hospital charges. If all the multiple gestations resulting from assisted-reproduction techniques had been singleton pregnancies, the predicted savings to the health care delivery system in the study hospital alone would have been over $3 million per year. Although assisted reproduction provides tremendous benefits to families with infertility, the increased medical risks entailed by multiple-gestation pregnancies and the associated costs cannot be ignored. We suggest that more attention be paid to approaches to infertility that reduce the likelihood of multiple gestation.",0
1099,23828786,Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base: extracting disease-manifestation relationship from literature,"Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale machine-understandable disease-phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract disease-manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease-phenotype relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical literature. Our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human effort required. For the text corpus, we used 119 085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 354 075 citations). First, we used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies as prior knowledge to automatically discover D-M-specific syntactic patterns. We then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. Finally, we analysed correlations between disease manifestations and disease-associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge base in disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. In total, we extracted 121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high precision of 0.924. Among the extracted pairs, 120 419 (99.2%) have not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources. We have shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both disease-associated genes and drug treatments. The main contribution of our study is the creation of a large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype relationship knowledge base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug repurposing. http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/DMPatternUMLS/ ",0
1100,1626376,Typing of Australian isolates of Treponema hyodysenteriae by serology and by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis,"A total of 91 isolates of Treponema hyodysenteriae which were obtained from 62 piggeries located around Australia were typed by serology and by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis (REA). The isolates fell into eight serogroups, of which groups B and D were the most common. Isolates with different REA patterns were recognised within serogroups, whilst a few isolates with the same REA pattern were placed into different serogroups. Some of the latter isolates were either from the same piggery or from farms with epidemiological links, thus indicating the bacteria may have altered their antigenic properties. A total of 31 different REA patterns were recognised amongst the Australian isolates. These comprised eight major patterns, with four of these being subdivided on the basis of minor differences in banding. Where a number of isolates were obtained from individual piggeries these all had the same REA pattern, and in one piggery isolates with the same pattern were recovered over a five year period. Plasmid bands were observed in 70 of the Australian isolates (77%), and in six of the seven overseas isolates included in the study for comparison. These plasmids did not affect the REA pattern. Of the States from which substantial numbers of isolates were examined, the greatest number of different strains (12 amongst 19 piggeries) were found from Victoria, and there were 10 REA patterns in strains from 24 piggeries in Queensland. Despite the large total number of different strains of T. hyodysenteriae in Australia, only three were found in more than one State. ",0

OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to assess the contributory role of viral hepatitis in antituberculosis drug hepatotoxicity. DESIGN: Serologic markers for viral hepatitis were studied in 57 patients who developed acute hepatitis during antituberculosis therapy with rifampicin and isoniazid. RESULTS: Among 705 adult tuberculous patients, 57 (8.1%) developed acute hepatitis during therapy with rifampicin and isoniazid. Serologic markers confirmed the presence of hepatitis B in 6 (10.5%) and hepatitis C in 4 (7%) of the 57 patients. Acute hepatitis A was not diagnosed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Hepatitis occurring during antituberculosis therapy may not be drug-induced in all patients. Apart from the other factors mentioned above the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries could be responsible for the higher incidence of antituberculosis-drug hepatitis.",1

Data on the sitting height/standing height ratio (Cormic index) in 17-year-old students, collected from 1949 to 2012 in successive birth cohorts, were used to assess secular changes in body frame. The cohort-specific Cormic index was used to assess how variation in body frame affected pulmonary function. FEV1 and FVC were lower than GLI-2012 reference values, with values progressively falling until age 35 to 40 years and then rising to European levels in the elderly. The Cormic index rose until 1942, then fell, with a nadir in the 1970s, before rising again until 1995. Nearly one-half of the spirometric variability from predicted values could be explained by differences in the Cormic index between birth cohorts. In low-income countries, improving health conditions are likely to drive increases in height and changes in relative leg length similar to those observed in Japan and, thus, to a change in body frame. This implies that height-based prediction equations for such populations will need to be periodically updated. ",0

1107,24991087,Niacin inhibits vascular inflammation via downregulating nuclear transcription factor-κB signaling pathway,"The study aimed to investigate the effect of niacin on vascular inflammatory lesions in vivo and in vitro as well as its lipid-regulating mechanism. In vivo study revealed that niacin downregulated the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) in plasma, suppressed protein expression of CD68 and NF-κB p65 in arterial wall, and attenuated oxidative stress in guinea pigs that have been fed high fat diet. In vitro study further confirmed that niacin decreased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α and inhibited NF-κB p65 and notch1 protein expression in oxLDL-stimulated HUVECs and THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, niacin attenuated oxLDL-induced apoptosis of HUVECs as well. In addition, niacin significantly lessened lipid deposition in arterial wall, increased HDL-C and apoA levels and decreased TG and non-HDL-C levels in plasma, and upregulated the mRNA amount of cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase A1 in liver of guinea pigs. These data suggest for the first time that niacin inhibits vascular inflammation in vivo and in vitro via downregulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, niacin also modulates plasma lipid by upregulating the expression of factors involved in the process of reverse cholesterol transport. ",0

Overall median serum ferritin decreased significantly at 1 year (p=0.002). Decreases occurred irrespective of whether patients were chelation-na?ve or previously chelated; changes were dependent on dose adjustments and ongoing iron intake. Sustained reductions in labile plasma iron were observed. Discontinuation rate (48.7%) and adverse event profile were consistent with previously reported deferasirox data in MDS. Alanine aminotransferase levels decreased significantly; change correlated significantly with reduction in serum ferritin (p<0.0001). This large dataset prospectively confirms the efficacy and well characterizes the safety profile of deferasirox in MDS.""",1
1112,27089846,Comparison of the inhibitory effects of tolcapone and entacapone against human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases,"Tolcapone and entacapone are two potent catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors with a similar skeleton and displaying similar pharmacological activities. However, entacapone is a very safe drug used widely in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, while tolcapone is only in limited use for Parkinson's patients and needs careful monitoring of hepatic functions due to hepatotoxicity. This study aims to investigate and compare the inhibitory effects of entacapone and tolcapone on human UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs), as well as to evaluate the potential risks from the view of drug-drug interactions (DDI). The results demonstrated that both tolcapone and entacapone exhibited inhibitory effects on UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10. In contrast to entacapone, tolcapone exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on UGT1A1, UGT1A7, and UGT1A10, while their inhibitory potentials against UGT1A9 were comparable. It is noteworthy that the inhibition constants (Ki) of tolcapone and entacapone against bilirubin-O-glucuronidation in human liver microsomes (HLM) are determined as 0.68muM and 30.82muM, respectively, which means that the inhibition potency of tolcapone on UGT1A1 mediated bilirubin-O-glucuronidation in HLM is much higher than that of entacapone. Furthermore, the potential risks of tolcapone or entacapone via inhibition of human UGT1A1 were quantitatively predicted by the ratio of the areas under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC). The results indicate that tolcapone may result in significant increase in AUC of bilirubin or the drugs primarily metabolized by UGT1A1, while entacapone is unlikely to cause a significant DDI through inhibition of UGT1A1.",1
1113,23292963,Hepatitis B virus hepatotropism is mediated by specific receptor recognition in the liver and not restricted to susceptible hosts,"The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic infections in humans and chimpanzees. HBV infects its hosts at minimal inoculation doses and replicates exclusively in hepatocytes. The viral determinants for the pronounced species specificity and the high efficacy to address hepatocytes in vivo are unknown. Previous findings showed that N-terminally myristoylated peptides constituting a receptor binding domain of the HBV large envelope (L)-protein block HBV entry in vitro and in vivo. Here we investigate the ability of such peptidic receptor ligands to target the liver. Injection of radioactively labeled HBVpreS-lipopeptides resulted in rapid accumulation in livers of mice, rats, and dogs but not cynomolgus monkeys. Without lipid moiety the peptide was excreted by renal filtration, indicating its possible retention through the lipid by serum factors. Organ distribution studies of 26 HBVpreS peptide variants revealed a correlation of HBV infection inhibition activity and the ability to target mouse livers. Together with complementary studies using primary hepatocytes of different species, we hypothesize that HBV hepatotropism is mediated through specific binding of the myristoylated N-terminal preS1-domain of the HBV L-protein to a hepatocyte specific receptor. Moreover, the restricted infectivity of HBV to human primates is not generally determined by the absence of this binding receptor in nonsusceptible hosts (e.g., mice) but related to postbinding step(s) (e.g., membrane fusion). CONCLUSION: HBVpreS-lipopeptides target to the liver. This observation has important clinical implications regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of Myrcludex B, the first entry inhibitor for HBV/HDV. In addition, this provides the basis for the application of the peptides as vehicles for hepatocyte-specific drug targeting.",0

1115,2696741,Rapid determination of methandrostenolone in equine urine by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,"Urine samples were spiked with [17-methyl-2H3]methandrostenolone as internal standard and extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane and cyclohexane. The organic phase was concentrated and injected onto a short octyl-silica column (30 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.) for separation of methandrostenolone and 17-epimethandrostenolone. The effluent from the column was connected to a Sciex TAGA 6000E triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure ion source for sampling of ions generated by a heated pneumatic nebulizer with corona discharge ionization. This ion source produced abundant [M + H]+ ions and a weak fragment ion due to loss of water. The protonated molecular ions at m/z 301 and 304 for methandrostenolone, 17-epimethandrostenolone and the internal standard were transmitted to the second quadrupole for collision-induced dissociation. Quantification was obtained by selected reaction monitoring of three daughter ions. Methandrostenolone and 17-epimethandrostenolone were separated by liquid chromatography, but gave identical mass spectra. The method detection limit by injection of a urine extract corresponding to 2.8 ml urine was 180 pg/ml at the 99% confidence level. The precision (relative standard deviation) was 3% at the 16 ng/ml level and the linear dynamic range was at least 3 orders of magnitude. Screening for unknown metabolites in urine after administration of methandrostenolone to horses and humans was accomplished by a parent ion scan of m/z 121, a fragment corresponding to the intact A-ring of the steroids.

Both target the Smoothened molecule and are indicated for locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) and metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical experience with HPIs, including efficacy and adverse effects. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic review in concordance with the PRISMA guidelines of PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EMBASE, using search terms """"vismodegib,"""" """"sonidegib,"""" """"Erivedge,"""" """"Odomza,"""" """"basal cell carcinoma,"""" and """"BCC."""" STUDY SELECTION: We included clinical trials, retrospective medical record reviews, and prospective case series that used HPIs for the treatment of laBCC or mBCC in human subjects. Individual case reports and limited, retrospective case series were excluded from our review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers on a predesigned, standardized form. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The following data were recorded: number of patients with laBCC or mBCC, dose and frequency of drug administration, median duration of treatment, clearance and recurrence rates, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Eleven vismodegib articles (published between 2009 and 2015) met criteria for inclusion, and 8 articles were able to be pooled for analysis. The 8 pooled articles included 744 total patients with 704 patients clinically evaluable. Sonidegib did not yield enough publications for a formal analysis. Objective response to vismodegib for laBCC had a weighted average of 64.7% (95% CI, 63.7%-65.6%); complete response averaged 31.1% (95% CI, 30.4%-31.8%). Objective response for mBCC was 33.6% (95% CI, 33.1%-34.2%); complete response averaged 3.9% (95% CI, 3.3%-4.4%). Median duration of therapy was 35.8 weeks (95% CI, 35.1-36.5 weeks). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a systematic review of HPIs for laBCC and mBCC, vismodegib, but not sonidegib, had enough studies to warrant a pooled analysis. Vismodegib was identified to have a significant, consistent effect on the median duration of therapy of laBCC and mBCC. While mBCC responses are superior to any traditional approach, the response rate for laBCC might be considered in the context of other standard treatment options including surgery and radiation therapy.""",1

METHODS: In an open-label, long-term extension trial following an initial 3-month randomised phase II trial, 143 of the 163 patients who participated in the initial blinded study received tocilizumab monotherapy (8 mg/kg) every 4 weeks. Concomitant therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or oral prednisolone (10 mg daily maximum) was permitted. All patients were evaluated with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) improvement criteria, disease activity score (DAS) in 28 joints, and the European League Against Rheumatism response, as well as for safety issues. RESULTS: 143 patients were enrolled in the open-label, long-term extension trial and 94 (66%) patients had completed 5 years as of March 2007. 32 patients (22%) withdrew from the study due to adverse events and one patient (0.7%) due to unsatisfactory response. 14 patients withdrew because of the patient's request or other reasons. The serious adverse event rate was 27.5 events per 100 patient-years, with 5.7 serious infections per 100 patient-years, based on a total tocilizumab exposure of 612 patient-years. Of the 88 patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, 78 (88.6%) were able to decrease their corticosteroid dose and 28 (31.8%) discontinued corticosteroids. At 5 years, 79/94 (84.0%), 65/94 (69.1%) and 41/94 (43.6%) of the patients achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 improvement criteria, respectively. Remission defined as DAS28 less than 2.6 was achieved in 52/94 (55.3%) of the patients.

1118,21521704,Clinical experience with linezolid in infants and children,"The worldwide spread of multidrug-resistant organisms has required the development of new antimicrobials. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone, has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains. Although approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, the clinical experience with linezolid in the paediatric population is still limited, also given the fact that in most European countries the paediatric use of linezolid is off-label. In this paper we summarize the actual evidence on both licensed and off-label clinical uses of linezolid in children, including efficacy, safety and tolerability issues. Taking into account the potential bias in comparing heterogeneous clinical trials and reports, the available literature data suggest that linezolid is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in neonates and children. At present, linezolid is reserved for those children who are intolerant to or fail conventional agents. A linezolid-containing regimen can be a valuable option for treating multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in children as well as disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. Given the rare occurrence of serious side effects, careful monitoring of haematological parameters, possible drug interactions and neurological manifestations is recommended in linezolid-treated children, especially in case of prolonged treatments. Appropriate linezolid dosage and hospital infection control measures are essential to avoid the spread of linezolid resistance. Further studies are needed to establish novel paediatric indications for linezolid use and to assess the tolerability of long-term treatments.",1

The described algorithm first determines the normalization factor and then calculates SILAC ratios for a list of target peptide masses using precursor ion abundances. Four yeast histone mutants were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for quantitation of peptide post-translational modifications changes. The details of the algorithm's approach for normalization and peptide ratio calculation are described. The examples demonstrate the robustness of the approach as well as its utility to rapidly determine changes in peptide post-translational modifications within a protein.  ,0
1120,26460177,Can paracetamol (acetaminophen) be administered to patients with liver impairment?,"Although 60 years have passed since it became widely available on the therapeutic market, paracetamol dosage in patients with liver disease remains a controversial subject. Fulminant hepatic failure has been a well documented consequence of paracetamol overdose since its introduction, while short and long term use have both been associated with elevation of liver transaminases, a surrogate marker for acute liver injury. From these reports it has been assumed that paracetamol use should be restricted or the dosage reduced in patients with chronic liver disease. We review the factors that have been purported to increase risk of hepatocellular injury from paracetamol and the pharmacokinetic alterations in different pathologies of chronic liver disease which may affect this risk. We postulate that inadvertent under-dosing may result in concentrations too low to enable efficacy. Specific research to improve the evidence base for prescribing paracetamol in patients with different aetiologies of chronic liver disease is needed.",1
1121,16503324,Possible metformin-induced hepatotoxicity,"BACKGROUND: Metformin hydrochloride is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2). To date, only 2 cases of possible metformin-induced hepatotoxicity (acute hepatitis) have been reported worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to report a case of serious hepatotoxicity possibly associated with metformin use in an elderly patient with DM-2. METHODS: After receiving metformin 500 mg/d for 3 weeks, a 73-year-old Japanese woman weighing 33.5 kg with poorly controlled DM-2 presented with fatigue, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Laboratory analysis showed severe hepatotoxicity (elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferases [AST and ALT, respectively], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and total bilirubin concentrations). The history, clinical findings, laboratory features, and clinical course of this case, as well as the pharmacologic profile of metformin, are presented. RESULTS: Immediate hospitalization and discontinuation of metformin treatment led to improvements in liver function (decreased AST, ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin concentrations) and resolution of the presented symptoms within 3 weeks. The probability of an adverse drug reaction (ADR), as assessed using the Naranjo ADR probability scale, in this case was 4 (probable). CONCLUSIONS: In this case of an elderly woman with DM-2 who presented with symptoms of hepatotoxicity after 3 weeks of metformin treatment, metformin appeared to have caused a mixed-type (hepatocellular and cholestatic) hepatic damage. Although rare, severe hepatotoxicity might be associated with metformin use in some cases.",1
1122,9657118,Modulation of immune responses to hepatitis C virus envelope E2 protein following injection of plasmid DNA using single or combined delivery routes,"Different delivery routes of plasmid DNA may result in the induction of differential humoral and cellular immunity. We have studied the influence of two main routes of plasmid injection, performed intramuscularly and intraepidermally using a gene gun, for the induction of immune responses specific to hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2. Three plasmids expressing different immunogenic domains of E2 (amino acids [aa] 384443, aa 504-555, and aa 384-746) were injected into BALB/c mice according to five different protocols using various combinations of intramuscular (i.m.) or intraepidermal (i.e.) primary and booster injections. Seroconversion rates, antibody titers and isotypes, epitope recognition, and T-helper (Th) release cytokine profiles were analyzed. Antibody titers and epitope recognition were linked to either or both the nature of the immunogen expressed and the delivery route chosen. In all cases, the lowest antibody titers were obtained using single i.m.-based protocols. Independently of the antibody titers generated, only some specific i.e.-combined delivery routes induced antibodies able to recognize determinants located in the N-terminal of E2 (aa 384411 and aa 411437) and mimicked by synthetic peptides. By contrast, the antibody isotypes and the splenic cytokine production identified were independent of the plasmids used and the delivery route implemented. All conditions resulted in Th-1 like responses suggested by the exclusive detection of IgG2a and 2b antibodies and the production of interferon gamma (INF-gamma) but no interleukin-4 (IL-4). Overall, our results suggest that the combination of i.m. and i.e. delivery routes provides the most efficient way to induce a broad immune response against HCV-E2.",0

We assessed the tolerability and activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC who were prospectively identified to have an ALK fusion within the first-in-man phase 1 crizotinib study. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, patients with ALK-positive stage III or IV NSCLC received oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Endpoints included tumour responses, duration of response, time to tumour response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 6 and 12 months, and determination of the safety and tolerability and characterisation of the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of crizotinib after oral administration. Responses were analysed in evaluable patients and PFS and safety were analysed in all patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00585195. FINDINGS: Between Aug 27, 2008, and June 1, 2011, 149 ALK-positive patients were enrolled, 143 of whom were included in the response-evaluable population. 87 of 143 patients had an objective response (60?8%, 95% CI 52?3-68?9), including three complete responses and 84 partial responses. Median time to first documented objective response was 7?9 weeks (range 2?1-39?6) and median duration of response was 49?1 weeks (95% CI 39?3-75?4). The response rate seemed to be largely independent of age, sex, performance status, or line of treatment. Median PFS was 9?7 months (95% CI 7?7-12?8). Median overall survival data are not yet mature, but estimated overall survival at 6 and 12 months was 87?9% (95% CI 81?3-92?3) and 74?8% (66?4-81?5), respectively. 39 patients continued to receive crizotinib for more than 2 weeks after progression because of perceived ongoing clinical benefit from the drug (12 for at least 6 months from the time of their initial investigator-defined disease progression). Overall, 144 (97%) of 149 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were visual effects, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and peripheral oedema. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (n=9), raised alanine aminotransferase (n=6), hypophosphataemia (n=6), and lymphopenia (n=6). INTERPRETATION: Crizotinib is well tolerated with rapid, durable responses in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. There seems to be potential for ongoing benefit after initial disease progression in this population, but a more formal definition of ongoing benefit in this context is needed.",1

In this dose-expansion cohort of that trial, we assess avelumab treatment in a cohort of patients with advanced, platinum-treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: In this dose-expansion cohort of a multicentre, open-label, phase 1 study, patients with progressive or platinum-resistant metastatic or recurrent NSCLC were enrolled at 58 cancer treatment centres and academic hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients had confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with squamous or non-squamous histology, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), tumour biopsy or archival sample for biomarker assessment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, among other criteria. Patient selection was not based on PD-L1 expression or expression of other biomarkers, including EGFR or KRAS mutation or ALK translocation status. Patients received infusional avelumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or toxicity. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort is closed and the trial is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Sept 10, 2013, and June 24, 2014, 184 patients were enrolled and initiated treatment with avelumab. Median follow-up duration was 8?8 months (IQR 7?2-11?9). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were fatigue (46 [25%] of 184 patients), infusion-related reaction (38 [21%]), and nausea (23 [13%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23 (13%) of 184 patients; the most common (occurring in more than two patients) were infusion-related reaction (four [2%] patients) and increased lipase level (three [2%]). 16 (9%) of 184 patients had a serious adverse event related to treatment with avelumab, with infusion-related reaction (in four [2%] patients) and dyspnoea (in two [1%]) occurring in more than one patient. Serious adverse events irrespective of cause occurred in 80 (44%) of 184 patients. Those occurring in more than five patients (?3%) were dyspnoea (ten patients [5%]), pneumonia (nine [5%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (six [3%]). Immune-related treatment-related events occurred in 22 patients (12%). Of 184 patients, 22 (12% [95% CI 8-18]) achieved a confirmed objective response, including one complete response and 21 partial responses. 70 (38%) had stable disease. Overall, 92 (50%) of 184 patients achieved disease control (they had a confirmed response or stable disease as their best overall response). One patient was initially thought to have died from grade 5 radiation pneumonitis during the study; however, this adverse event was subsequently regraded to grade 3 and the death was attributed to disease progression. INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed an acceptable safety profile and antitumour activity in patients with progressive or treatment-resistant NSCLC, providing a rationale for further studies of avelumab in this disease setting.

1125,15282233,Which agents should we use for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,"The inappropriate treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis can lead to the selection and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), indicating resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. In the treatment of MDR-TB, residual first-line drugs, such as ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin must be appropriately combined with additional second-line drugs, guided by individual susceptibility patterns. The clinical pharmacology of these second-line antituberculous drugs is reviewed. Fluoroquinolones represent the only substantial therapeutic advance in the last 20 years. Many factors potentially affect the outcome of MDR-TB. Treatment adherence, prior exposure to antituberculous drugs, the number of drugs to which the infection is still susceptible and the time since the first diagnosis of tuberculosis are the most relevant. The management of MDR-TB requires considerable expertise. When initiating or revising therapy for MDR-TB, the process of selecting drugs should rely on prior treatment history, results of susceptibility testing and an evaluation of the patient's adherence. In making drug selection, we propose to follow a hierarchy based on the intrinsic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the clinical evidence of efficacy of the available active compounds.",1

Recent trials of the small-molecule EGFR inhibitor gefitinib have now more clearly defined indications for usage, and clinical and molecular factors predictive of benefit. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: A systematic search of the literature (Medline, ASCO, WCLC meeting abstracts) was performed from January 2000 to January 2010. The Phase III INTEREST study found gefitinib in unselected, pretreated patients was not inferior to docetaxel chemotherapy in overall survival, offering improved quality of life and superior toxicity profile. The Phase III IPASS study demonstrated improved progression-free survival with gefitinib compared with paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naive, never/light ex-smokers with adenocarcinoma histology. Stratifying for EGFR mutation revealed mutation-positive patients had superior outcomes with gefitinib compared with chemotherapy. Subsequent studies (WJOG4305, NEJ002), selecting only EGFR mutation-positive patients prospectively confirm this finding. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The profile of gefitinib and landmark trials in NSCLC are summarized. How biomarkers may further optimize therapeutic benefit is highlighted. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Gefitinib is expected to have an important impact on management of pretreated and selected chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, activating EGFR mutations are proven to be of value for prediction of those who will derive most benefit.",1
1127,3554879,The treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a double-blind clinical trial of a new anti-spastic drug tizanidine compared with baclofen,"""The anti-spastic effect of a new drug, tizanidine, was compared with that of baclofen in a double-blind clinical trial; 40 seriously handicapped patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were randomly allocated treatment with one or the other drug for a 6-week period. The antispastic effect was evaluated by clinical criteria. The optimal daily dose of both drugs varied considerably from patient to patient, and was on the average 23 mg for Tizanidin and 59 mg for baclofen. To the extent an antispastic effect was observed, the 2 drugs appeared to be equally effective when given at a 1:2 ratio (mg tizanidine: mg baclofen). Side effects of both drugs were sleepiness, muscular weakness and dry mouth. Tizanidine had a mild depressive effect on blood pressure. Sudden withdrawal of both drugs was accompanied by a transient relative increase of spasticity in approximately half the patients. There were no other changes suggesting physical or psychological dependence. The present study underscores that neither baclofen nor tizanidine are ideal antispastic drugs, and emphasize the need for further research.""",1

Levonorgestrel is available for sale without restrictions, whereas ulipristal acetate is available with prescription only, and the copper IUD must be inserted by a clinician. Although EC pills have not been shown to reduce pregnancy or abortion rates at the population level, they are an important option for individual women seeking to prevent pregnancy after sex.",1
1129,16148247,Natural history of menopause symptoms in primary care patients: a MetroNet study,"The association between changes in menopausal status and menopause-related symptom reporting over the course of the menopause transition is not well understood, especially whether there are any racial differences in this association. To determine (1) the prevalence and the natural history of menopause symptoms among primary care patients approaching, or at menopause; (2) the relationship between self-reported symptoms and menopausal status; and (3) whether this relationship varies in African American and white women. Cross-sectional self-report survey of 342 women aged 40 to 55 years (31.6% African American) were recruited from 8 family practice centers in 2000 and 2001. Among 251 women without surgical menopause, 133 (53.0%) were premenopausal, 72 (28.7%) were peri-menopausal, and 46 (18.3%) were postmenopausal. The most commonly reported symptoms were joint/muscle pain and headache, which did not vary by menopausal status. As many as 28.6% of the women with regular menstruation reported hot flashes, and 18.8% had night sweats; although both symptoms were strongly associated with changes in menopausal status (P < .01). During the natural menopausal transition, white women had increasing trends of nervousness, memory loss, vaginal dryness, loss of sexual interest, hot flashes, and night sweats while African American women only had increasing trend of painful sex and hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, loss of sexual interest was associated with postmenopause status in white but not in African American women. Symptoms are not uncommon among premenopausal women and become more prevalent as the transition through menopause occurs. The prevalence of vasomotor symptoms in premenopausal women may be an under-recognized aspect of the natural history of the menopause transition. African American and white women may present different symptoms through menopause transition. ",0

1131,7517215,Induction of fetal hemoglobin production in subjects with sickle cell anemia by oral sodium phenylbutyrate,"""Intravenous arginine butyrate has been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in sickle cell and thalassemia patients. Recently, we observed that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, a drug administered orally to treat urea cycle disorders, increases HbF production in nonanemic children and adults. We treated six subjects with sickle cell disease over a period of 14 to 179 days. All subjects received their initial therapy of 9 to 13 g/m2/day as 0.5-g tablets of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate as inpatients. All subjects showed a rapid increase in the percentage of F-reticulocytes (pretreatment, 1% to 20%; posttreatment, 10% to 44%). Four subjects were treated only 11 to 25 days as inpatients. Two of these four subjects failed to respond to the outpatient component because of their inability to maintain an intake of 30 to 40 tablets per day. One subject (C) developed a rash at day 10 and discontinued treatment at day 14. Another subject (B) was transfused for a painful crisis on day 25. Subject A, treated for 179 days, has an increased percentage of F cells, from 54% to 77%, and increased HbF levels, from 10.6% to 18%. Subject F, treated for 154 days, has an increased percentage of F cells, from 59% to 73%, and an increased percentage of HbF, from 10.4% to 16%. All subjects showed some increase in weight. Subject A developed mild transient ankle edema. Myelotoxicity was not seen in any treated patient. Oral administration of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate rapidly increases F-cell production in sickle cell disease.""",1
1132,24647231,Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302),"""BACKGROUND: Abiraterone acetate (an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor) plus prednisone is approved for treating patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Study COU-AA-302 evaluated abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with progressive mCRPC without prior chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: Report the prespecified third interim analysis (IA) of efficacy and safety outcomes in study COU-AA-302. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Study COU-AA-302, a double-blind placebo-controlled study, enrolled patients with mCRPC from April 2009 to June 2010. A total of 1088 patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 1:1 to abiraterone 1000mg plus prednisone 5mg twice daily by mouth versus prednisone. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Co-primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Median times to event outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using the Cox model, and treatment comparison used the log-rank test. The O'Brien-Fleming Lan-DeMets ?-spending function was used for OS. Adverse events were summarised descriptively. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: With a median follow-up duration of 27.1 mo, improvement in rPFS was statistically significant with abiraterone treatment versus prednisone (median: 16.5 vs 8.2 mo; HR: 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45-0.61]; p<0.0001). Abiraterone improved OS (median: 35.3 vs 30.1 mo; HR: 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.95]; p=0.0151) but did not reach the prespecified statistical efficacy boundary (?-level: 0.0035). A post hoc multivariate analysis for OS using known prognostic factors supported the primary results (HR: 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61-0.89]; p=0.0017), and all clinically relevant secondary end points and patient-reported outcomes improved. While the post hoc nature of the long-term safety analysis is a limitation, the safety profile with longer treatment exposure was consistent with prior reports. CONCLUSIONS: The updated IA of study COU-AA-302 in patients with mCRPC without prior chemotherapy confirms that abiraterone delays disease progression, pain, and functional deterioration and has clinical benefit with a favourable safety profile, including in patients treated for ?24 mo. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Study COU-AA-302, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00887198. PATIENT SUMMARY: The updated results of this ongoing study showed that disease progression was delayed in patients with advanced prostate cancer who were treated with abiraterone acetate and prednisone, and there was a continued trend in prolongation of life compared with patients treated with prednisone alone. Treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone was well tolerated by patients who were treated for >2 yr.""",1
1133,8446139,Use of multiple drugs among adolescents who use anabolic steroids,"BACKGROUND: Because adolescent users of anabolic steroids are concerned with increasing muscle size and strength, they may be unique among substance users and unlikely to use other drugs. Alternatively, if the factors that cause the use of anabolic steroids are similar to those associated with the use of other substances, adolescents who use anabolic steroids would be expected to report use of other drugs as well. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire based on the 1989 Secondary School Health Risk Survey and the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 1881 students enrolled in compulsory health-science classes (mean [+/- SD] age, 14.9 +/- 1.0 years) in the Richmond County, Georgia, school system. RESULTS: A higher percentage of boys (6.5 percent) than girls (1.9 percent, P < or = 0.001) reported using anabolic steroids without a doctor's prescription. Among ninth-grade students only, 5.4 percent of boys and 1.5 percent of girls reported using anabolic steroids (P < or = 0.001). Among users of anabolic steroids, 25 percent reported sharing needles to inject drugs. The frequency of anabolic-steroid use was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the frequency of use in the previous 30 days of cocaine (r = 0.44), injectable drugs, alcohol (r = 0.23), marijuana (r = 0.42), cigarettes (r = 0.25), and smokeless tobacco (r = 0.40). On the basis of multiple regression analysis, the use of marijuana, shared needles, smokeless tobacco, and cocaine accounted for 33 percent of the variation in anabolic-steroid use among the ninth-grade students. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, adolescent users of anabolic steroids were likely to use other drugs as well, and many were sharing needles.",0
1134,21492891,[Relationship between plasma concentrations of valproic acid and hepatotoxicity in patients receiving high doses],"INTRODUCTION: Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsivant drug widely prescribed in the treatment of many forms of generalized epilepsy. In literature, the incidence of liver damage induced by AVP is 0.01%. It is potentialized by the combination therapy (phenobarbital, carbamazepine). Severe hepatotoxicity is rare and appears to be independent of dose and to cause a high mortality. METHODS: The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between plasma concentrations of AVP and the occurrence of side effects especially hepatotoxicity in patients receiving high doses of AVP. RESULTS: In this period, 425 plasmatic AVP monitoring were carried out in our laboratory. From 128 patients treated by high doses of AVP, only 73 were included in this study. Our work showed that adverse effects in epileptics under high doses of AVP was related to the association of the AVP with other antiepileptic in particular carbamaz?pine, phenobarbital and benzodiazepines rather than supra-therapeutic plasmatic concentrations of AVP. The association of AVP to major antiepileptics (carbamaz?pine and or phenobarbital) does not seem to generate an increase in the plasmatic concentration of AVP, which was not associated with a greater risque of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Consequently, clinical signs of liver toxicity may be present in AVP concentrations generally considered in the therapeutic range especially when used in high doses and or combined with antiepileptic drugs like phenobarbital or carbamazepine.",1

1136,8418405,"Unconventional medicine in the United States. Prevalence, costs, and patterns of use","BACKGROUND: Many people use unconventional therapies for health problems, but the extent of this use and the costs are not known. We conducted a national survey to determine the prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of unconventional therapies, such as acupuncture and chiropractic. METHODS: We limited the therapies studied to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals. We completed telephone interviews with 1539 adults (response rate, 67 percent) in a national sample of adults 18 years of age or older in 1990. We asked respondents to report any serious or bothersome medical conditions and details of their use of conventional medical services; we then inquired about their use of unconventional therapy. RESULTS: One in three respondents (34 percent) reported using at least one unconventional therapy in the past year, and a third of these saw providers for unconventional therapy. The latter group had made an average of 19 visits to such providers during the preceding year, with an average charge per visit of $27.60. The frequency of use of unconventional therapy varied somewhat among socio-demographic groups, with the highest use reported by nonblack persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes. The majority used unconventional therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions. Among those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions, the vast majority (83 percent) also sought treatment for the same condition from a medical doctor; however, 72 percent of the respondents who used unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so. Extrapolation to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy. This number exceeds the number of visits to all U.S. primary care physicians (388 million). Expenditures associated with use of unconventional therapy in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid out of pocket. This figure is comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of use of unconventional therapy in the United States is far higher than previously reported. Medical doctors should ask about their patients' use of unconventional therapy whenever they obtain a medical history.",0
1137,2920997,Stimulation of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes by Kupffer cells after partial hepatectomy,"The role of Kupffer cells during reparative regeneration of rat liver was investigated with an in vitro experimental model. Conditioned media from primary cultures of Kupffer cells isolated from intact and regenerating liver were added to primary cultures of hepatocytes, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was studied. Kupffer cell-conditioned media from intact liver and regenerating remnant liver significantly stimulated DNA synthesis in hepatocytes as compared with control media (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the stimulating activity of Kupffer cells prepared from regenerating liver at 6 and 12 hr after partial hepatectomy was significantly higher than that of Kupffer cells from untreated rats (p less than 0.05). The activity was found in serum-free conditioned media. This stimulating activity exponentially increased as the increase of the number of the cultured cells, indicating that the stimulating activity was released directly by cultured Kupffer cells. These results suggest that Kupffer cells stimulate DNA synthesis in hepatocytes by producing and releasing certain factor(s) at an early stage of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.",0
1138,12826639,The quality of health care delivered to adults in the United States,"BACKGROUND: We have little systematic information about the extent to which standard processes involved in health care--a key element of quality--are delivered in the United States. METHODS: We telephoned a random sample of adults living in 12 metropolitan areas in the United States and asked them about selected health care experiences. We also received written consent to copy their medical records for the most recent two-year period and used this information to evaluate performance on 439 indicators of quality of care for 30 acute and chronic conditions as well as preventive care. We then constructed aggregate scores. RESULTS: Participants received 54.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 54.3 to 55.5) of recommended care. We found little difference among the proportion of recommended preventive care provided (54.9 percent), the proportion of recommended acute care provided (53.5 percent), and the proportion of recommended care provided for chronic conditions (56.1 percent). Among different medical functions, adherence to the processes involved in care ranged from 52.2 percent for screening to 58.5 percent for follow-up care. Quality varied substantially according to the particular medical condition, ranging from 78.7 percent of recommended care (95 percent confidence interval, 73.3 to 84.2) for senile cataract to 10.5 percent of recommended care (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 14.6) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The deficits we have identified in adherence to recommended processes for basic care pose serious threats to the health of the American public. Strategies to reduce these deficits in care are warranted.",0
1139,23168376,A skewed thiopurine metabolism is a common clinical phenomenon that can be successfully managed with a combination of low-dose azathioprine and allopurinol,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A skewed thiopurine metabolism is a phenomenon associated with both poor treatment response and toxicity. Our aim was to evaluate the frequency of this phenomenon and the relationship to thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) function. METHODS: All thiopurine metabolite measurements in adult patients (n=4033) between January 2006 and April 2012 were assessed to evaluate the occurrence of a skewed metabolism and the relationship to TPMT genotype and activity. RESULTS: A skewed metabolism was observed in 14% of all patients. It only developed in patients with a normal TPMT genotype, but was observed at all TPMT activity levels within the normal range (9.1-24.2 U/ml RBC). Two cases that illustrate typical clinical scenarios of a skewed metabolism and the effect of combination treatment with low-dose azathioprine and allopurinol are presented. CONCLUSIONS: A skewed metabolism is a common clinical phenomenon in patients with a normal TPMT function, which can develop at all TPMT activity levels within the normal range. We suggest that metabolite measurements should be considered in patients not responding to treatment and in those with hepatotoxicity or myelotoxicity in order to detect a skewed metabolism, since this phenomenon can be successfully managed by a combination of low-dose azathioprine and allopurinol.",1
1140,3897864,Clinical prediction rules. Applications and methodological standards,"The objective of clinical prediction rules is to reduce the uncertainty inherent in medical practice by defining how to use clinical findings to make predictions. Clinical prediction rules are derived from systematic clinical observations. They can help physicians identify patients who require diagnostic tests, treatment, or hospitalization. Before adopting a prediction rule, clinicians must evaluate its applicability to their patients. We describe methodological standards that can be used to decide whether a prediction rule is suitable for adoption in a clinician's practice. We applied these standards to 33 reports of prediction rules; 42 per cent of the reports contained an adequate description of the prediction rules, the patients, and the clinical setting. The misclassification rate of the rule was measured in only 34 per cent of reports, and the effects of the rule on patient care were described in only 6 per cent of reports. If the objectives of clinical prediction rules are to be fully achieved, authors and readers need to pay close attention to basic principles of study design.",0
1141,6770287,Seizure management in acute hepatic porphyria: risks of valproate and clonazepam,"Seizures may occur in acute intermittent porphyria or other hepatic porphyrias. Management is difficult, because barbiturates and hydantoins exacerbate the porphyric state. We studied one patient with major motor seizures and acute intermittent porphyria. The seizure disorder was exacerbated by phenytoin and did not respond to a high-carbohydrate diet or to intravenous hematin. Clonazepam was ineffective in treating the seizures and, in high doses, seemed to exacerbate the porphyria. Both clonazepam and valproate were porphyrinogenic in experimental test systems. Because both drugs may exacerbate the acute hepatic porphyrias, bromide remains the drug of choice to treat these seizures.",1
1142,10377032,Human sperm proteome: immunodominant sperm surface antigens identified with sera from infertile men and women,"The objective of this study was to identify those immunodominant sperm antigens recognized by antisperm antibodies (ASA) in the serum samples of infertile men and women. High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was employed to separate human sperm proteins using isoelectric focusing or nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis, followed by PAGE. Serum samples from 15 infertile male subjects and 6 infertile female subjects that contained ASA as assayed by the immunobead binding test (IBT) were analyzed by Western blotting followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Serum samples from 10 fertile subjects (5 males and 5 females) that were ASA negative by IBT were used as controls. The ECL blots were analyzed by computer scanning to compare the immunoreactivity between serum samples from fertile and infertile subjects and to identify the antigens unique to the sera of the infertile subjects; 98 sperm auto- and iso-antigenic protein spots were recognized by sera from infertile males and females but not from fertile subjects. Based on vectorial labeling with 125I at the sperm surface, a subset of 6 auto- and iso-antigens was identified as possibly relevant to antibody-mediated infertility. ",0
1143,12297830,Prevention of bile acid-induced apoptosis by betaine in rat liver,"Bile acid-induced apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease, and its prevention is of therapeutic interest. The effects of betaine were studied on taurolithocholate 3-sulfate (TLCS) and glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Hepatocyte apoptosis, caspase activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which are normally observed in response to both bile acids, were largely prevented after preincubation of hepatocytes with betaine. Betaine uptake was required for this protective effect, which was already observed at betaine concentrations of 1 mmol/L. Betaine did not affect the TLCS-induced membrane trafficking of CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2 to the plasma membrane or the TLCS-induced recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase 8 to the CD95 receptor. However, betaine largely prevented cytochrome c release and oxidative stress exerted otherwise by TLCS. Inhibition of caspase 9 strongly blunted TLCS-induced caspase-8 activation. Further betaine did not prevent the TLCS-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) activation or TLCS-induced protein kinase B (PKB) dephosphorylation. The protective betaine effect was insensitive to inhibition of Erks by PD089059, of p38(MAPK) by SB203580, or of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) by LY294002. Betaine supplementation in the drinking water significantly ameliorated in vivo hepatocyte apoptosis following bile duct ligation. In conclusion, this study identifies betaine as a potent protectant against bile acid-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, and its antiapoptotic action largely resides on an inhibition of the proapoptotic mitochondrial pathway.",0
1144,16526318,Early prognostic factors in patients with acute renal failure requiring dialysis,"Despite improvements in renal therapy and technology, the mortality rate of patients with acute renal failure (ARF) remains high. Because ARF is a heterogeneous syndrome, occurring in patients with diverse etiologies and comorbid conditions, predicting its outcome is difficult. This study aims to identify early clinical and laboratory prognostic factors, including acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and albumin, in ARF patients requiring dialysis. From June 2002 to March 2004, 61 patients with ARF requiring dialysis at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, were prospectively analyzed. For each patient, the worst values of prognostic variables 24 hr before starting dialysis were prospectively assessed. Oliguria, low plasma fibrinogen levels, hypotension, cardiac disease, and neoplastic disease were statistically significant in predicting hospital mortality. Using Youden's index, the best cut-off value for plasma fibrinogen in predicting mortality was 300 mg/dL with a sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 96%, respectively. Serum CRP and serum albumin were not predictive of hospital mortality. Early prognostic factors in predicting mortality for patients with ARF requiring dialysis identified by multivariate logistic regression were oliguria, low plasma fibrinogen, hypotension, cardiac disease, and neoplastic disease. Serum CRP and albumin were not predictive of hospital mortality, whereas a plasma fibrinogen level < or =300 mg/dL had 61% sensitivity and 96% specificity in predicting mortality. ",0
1145,11844656,A pilot study of the safety and efficacy of cholestin in treating HIV-related dyslipidemia,"""OBJECTIVE: We collected preliminary safety and efficacy data on the effects of Cholestin, a statin-containing dietary supplement, in individuals with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus. METHODS: Fourteen adults with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus characterized by hypercholesterolemia, hypertriacylglycerolemia, or both participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in an infectious disease clinic based in an academic medical center. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1.2 g of Cholestin twice daily (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) for 8 wk. The main outcome measures were safety (hepatic function tests, plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA levels, CD4(+) cell counts, adverse effects) and efficacy (fasting serum cholesterol: total, high- and low-density lipoproteins, and fasting serum triacylglycerols). Safety and efficacy outcomes were evaluated at 2- and 8-wk intervals. RESULTS: Twelve participants (n = 6 per group) completed the 8-wk treatment protocol. After 8 wk of treatment with Cholestin, there were significant declines from baseline in mean (+/- standard error of the mean) fasting total cholesterol (-30.8 +/- 8.8 versus 7.7 +/- 5.6; P = 0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-32.2 +/- 7.2 versus 26.3 +/- 14.2; P = 0.01) versus placebo. Moreover, the decline in fasting total cholesterol was significant (-40.2 +/- 4.8 versus 2.8 +/- 11.9; P = 0.006) after 2 wk of therapy, at which time the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol approached significance (-30.2 +/- 7.4 versus 4.4 +/- 15.2; P = 0.068). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels did not change at either time point. No adverse effects were seen with Cholestin. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestin may safely lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with dsylipidemia related to human immunodeficiency virus. Larger and longer-term trials of this approach are warranted.""",1

About 1 month later, despite discontinuation, he developed jaundice and liver test abnormalities. These resolved gradually over the next few months. Based on case reports and the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, a high index of suspicion for ticlopidine-induced jaundice is prudent in patients with recent exposure to the agent who have evidence of liver damage.",1
1147,30755021,Left ventricular hypertrophy in world class elite athletes is associated with signs of improved cardiac autonomic regulation,"In this study we sought to assess whether in elite athletes the physiological increase in cardiac mass attending severe long-term training leading to athlete's heart is accompanied by an improvement of autonomic performance, as assessed by post exercise vagal indices and a novel unitary Autonomic Nervous System Index for sports (ANSIs). The study involved 500 elite athletes (23.9 ± 6.4 years) participating in a screening organised by the National Italian Olympic Committee. All subjects underwent a complete medical examination, rest and stand autonomic assessment (heart rate variability) as well as bicycle exercise. ANSIs was also derived as radar plot from rest, stand and heart rate recovery individual proxies of autonomic nervous system regulation. All subjects were grouped into those with left ventricular hypertrophy present (LVH(+)), or not (LVH(-)), according to recognised thresholds. We observed that LVH(+) athletes (24.8%) showed a marked increase of post-exercise vagal indices ( p < 0.001) and of ANSIs ( p < 0.001), while no difference was observed for heart-rate variability indices. These changes were contingent upon sport intensity categories. Elite athletes with physiological cardiac hypertrophy (LVH(+)) present a selective profile of indices of autonomic nervous system performance, characterised by increases of markers of vagal recovery and of the novel unitary autonomic index for sports while RR variance and spectral indices seem to be unmodified. Athlete's heart may be characterised by a specific combination of anatomical and neurocardiac remodeling. This approach might furnish potential warning signs differentiating normal training induced physiology from pathological adaptation. ",0
1148,2967432,Cigarette smoking and levels of adrenal androgens in postmenopausal women,"An antiestrogenic effect of cigarette smoking has been suggested, principally on the basis of data on premenopausal women. We examined the relation between cigarette smoking and endogenous sex-hormone levels in a population of 233 white, postmenopausal women 60 to 79 years of age. Current cigarette smokers had significantly higher mean plasma levels of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione than nonsmokers. Mean levels for smokers and nonsmokers were 3.1 mumol per liter (116 micrograms per deciliter) and 2.3 mumol per liter (86 micrograms per deciliter), respectively (P less than 0.001), for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 27.8 nmol per liter (797 pg per milliliter) and 22.5 nmol per liter (643 pg per milliliter), respectively (P = 0.002), for androstenedione. A dose-response relation was apparent for these hormones; mean plasma levels increased concomitantly with cigarette consumption. The differences in hormone levels remained after adjustment for age and body-mass index. Mean levels of estrone, estradiol, testosterone, and sex-hormone-binding globulin did not differ between smokers and nonsmokers. These results suggest that the possible decreased risk of breast and endometrial cancer associated with cigarette smoking may not be mediated through lower levels of endogenous estrogen, at least in postmenopausal women, and they raise questions about the role of androgens in disease mechanisms in older populations.",0
1149,998788,Effects of hypoxia on cardiac growth in neonatal rat,"To determine whether low oxygen environments enhance cardiac cell division in the neonatal period, newborn rat pups were reared for 21 days in 12-15% oxygen. Left ventricle and right ventricle weights were 30 and 180% greater than controls matched for body weight (P less than 0.001) as were left ventricle/body weight ratios (3.68+/-0.26 vs. 2.99+/-0.05 mg LV/g body wt,P less than 0.001). Left ventricular total DNA and DNA concentration was 95 and 48% greater than controls (P less than 0.001). Autoradiography confirmed that this increase in ventricular DNA resulted from an increased rate of division of cardiac muscle cells, fibroblast, and vascular endothelial cells. When [3H]thymidine was injected on day ), autoradiographs prepared on day 21 reflected an increased dilution of label in hypoxic rats consistent with enhanced proliferation. The labeling index and grains per nucleus of ventricular muscle cells was 25% (P less than 0.01) and 20% (P less than 0.02) less than controls, Thus, hypoxic stress applied early in the neonatal period augments the rate of division and ultimate number of cardiac muscle cells. Whether this enhancement results from a primary effect of oxygen or from secondary hemodynamic factors remains unknown. ",0

1151,15043593,Complement activation in prestorage leucocyte-filtered plasma,"Complement activation and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines occur during storage of blood components. Prestorage leucocyte filtration of platelet concentrates and red cells diminishes the accumulation of leucocyte-derived cytokines during storage, however, transfusion reactions are not eliminated. We investigated inflammatory mediator release during storage of plasma and whole blood and the effect of prestorage leucocyte filtration of plasma. Twenty-four blood units were collected from healthy blood donors and stored for 35 days. Eight units were stored as whole blood, eight units as plasma and eight units as prestorage filtered plasma. Samples were collected weekly for analyses of potassium, leucocytes, free plasma haemoglobin, complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha]. Elevated levels of C3a and SC5b-9 were registered in filtered plasma, from the beginning of storage. C3a levels increased during storage. There was a higher rate of change during storage in C3a (P < 0.01) and SC5b-9 (P < 0.05) in plasma compared with filtered plasma. Interleukin (IL)-8 is released in whole blood.

Only 2-n-propylglutarate, the end product of omega-oxidation of VPA, was excreted in markedly increased amounts, while other VPA metabolites were undetectable. Although the primary cause of fulminant hepatitis and the mechanism of enhanced VPA metabolism by the hepatic P-450 system in this patient are not clear, our findings suggest that P-450-mediated reactions become the predominant metabolic pathway of VPA in a stage of fulminant hepatic failure.",1
1155,25003314,Immunotherapy and radiation therapy: considerations for successfully combining radiation into the paradigm of immuno-oncology drug development,"As the immunotherapy of cancer comes of age, adding immunotherapeutic agents to radiation therapy has the potential to improve the outcomes for patients with a wide variety of malignancies. Despite the enormous potential of such combination therapy, laboratory data has been lacking and there is little guidance for pursuing novel treatment strategies. Animal models have significant limitation in combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy and some of the limitations of preclinical models are discussed in this article. In addition to the preclinical challenges, radiation therapy and immunotherapy combinations may have overlapping toxicities, and for both types of therapy, early and late manifestations of toxicity are possible. Given these risks, special attention should be given to the design of the specific Phase I clinical trial that is chosen. In this article, we describe several Phase I design possibilities that may be employed, including the 3 + 3 design (also known as the cohort of 3 design), the continual reassessment method (CRM), and the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM). Efficacy end points for further development of combination therapy must be based on multiple factors, including disease type, stage of disease, the setting of therapy and the goal of therapy. While the designs for future clinical trials will vary, it is clear that these two successful modalities of therapy can and should be combined for the benefit of cancer patients.  ",0

There is no effective treatment for the pulmonary fibrosis except lung transplantation, but an initial trial using pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic agent, showed promising results. The current, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, double-blind trial investigated the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone for mild to moderate HPS-1 and 4 pulmonary fibrosis. Subjects were evaluated every 4 months at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, and the primary outcome parameter was change in forced vital capacity using repeated measures analysis with random coefficients. Thirty-five subjects with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were enrolled during a 4-year interval; 23 subjects received pirfenidone and 12 received placebo. Four subjects withdrew from the trial, 3 subjects died, and 10 serious adverse events were reported. Both groups experienced similar side effects, especially gastroesophageal reflux. Interim analysis of the primary outcome parameter, performed 12 months after 30 patients were enrolled, showed no statistical difference between the placebo and pirfenidone groups, and the study was stopped due to futility. There were no significant safety concerns. Other clinical trials are indicated to identify single or multiple drug regimens that may be effective in treatment for progressive HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis.""",1

Dabrafenib is the second approved selective BRAF inhibitor (after vemurafenib) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-positive melanoma. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the current data on the efficacy and safety of the selective BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in patients with metastatic BRAF V600 positive melanoma. The pharmacological, safety and efficacy data are discussed from Phase I, II, and III studies of dabrafenib monotherapy as well as in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. EXPERT OPINION: Dabrafenib has demonstrated comparable efficacy to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients. Dabrafenib is well tolerated in patients with metastatic melanoma, including patients with brain metastases. Nevertheless side effects are common, but usually manageable. In the Phase III study testing dabrafenib, 53% of patients reported grade 2 or higher adverse events (AEs). Toxicities were similar to those seen in the early-phase trials, with the most common being cutaneous manifestations (hyperkeratosis, papillomas, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), pyrexia, fatigue, headache, and arthralgia. Combining a BRAF inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor, which may block paradoxical MAPK activation in BRAF wild type (skin) cells, may lower the incidence of squamoproliferative eruptions.",1

The last four years he was treated only with risperidone at a dose of 3 mg per day. He was admitted to hospital due to a psychotic decompensation. Jaundice and skin pruritus were also observed at admission. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzymes. Cholestatic and viral hepatitis were excluded. Risperidone was changed to other antipsychotic drugs. After 7 weeks of treatment the patient was discharged with significant improvement of his mental condition. The liver function test results returned to normal values except for the slightly increased total bilirubin level. Regular liver monitoring was suggested. In this case liver dysfunction was possibly correlated with long-term risperidone therapy.,1

The patient was a 63-year-old man who developed signs of a stroke following a myocardial infarct after a left carotid endarterectomy and died seven days later. At autopsy, extensive necrosis of centrum semiovale was found only in the cerebral hemisphere supplied by the endoarterectomized carotid artery. A recent thrombus was found at the site of the endarterectomy, and the right common carotid artery was completely occluded by an old thrombus. This observation probably is explained by a well-established collateral blood supply to the right cerebral hemisphere, which protected it from the effects of the hypotension that accompanied the myocardial infarct.

1163,26448099,"Integrin ?v?6 critically regulates hepatic progenitor cell function and promotes ductular reaction, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis","Integrin ?v?6 is rapidly up-regulated on cells of epithelial lineage during tissue injury, where one of its primary functions is activation of latent transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF?1). In human liver cirrhosis, ?v?6 is overexpressed by cells comprising the ductular reaction, and its inhibition suppresses experimental biliary fibrosis in rodents. Here, we show that ?v?6 is expressed on the actively proliferating subset of hepatic progenitor cells and is required for their progenitor function in vivo and in vitro through integrin ?v?6-dependent TGF?1 activation. Freshly isolated ?v?6(+) liver cells demonstrate clonogenic potential and differentiate into cholangiocytes and functional hepatocytes in vitro, whereas colony formation by epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive progenitor cells is blocked by ?v?6-neutralizing antibody and in integrin beta 6-deficient cells. Inhibition of progenitors by anti-?v?6 antibody is recapitulated by TGF?1 neutralization and rescued by addition of bioactive TGF?1. Genetic disruption or selective targeting of ?v?6 with 3G9 antibody potently inhibits progenitor cell responses in mouse models of chronic biliary injury and protects from liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis, two conditions clinically associated with exacerbated ductular reaction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ?v?6 is a promising target for chronic fibrotic liver diseases and associated cancers.",0

A controlled clinical trial,"One hundred eighty-nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis were entered into a prospective, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial comparing placebo and methotrexate (MTX). One hundred ten patients completed 18 weeks of therapy. No remissions were seen, but patients able to tolerate low-dose pulse MTX therapy were significantly improved, compared with patients receiving placebo therapy, for all clinical variables measured, including joint pain/tenderness and swelling counts, rheumatoid nodules, and patient and physician assessment of disease activity. MTX treatment demonstrated statistically significant improvement over placebo in patients with anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and rheumatoid factor. However, nearly one-third of the patients receiving MTX were withdrawn for adverse drug reactions, of which elevated levels of liver enzymes was the most common. Pancytopenia occurred in 2 patients taking MTX. All adverse drug effects resolved without sequelae. MTX appears to be effective in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis but requires close monitoring for toxicity.",1
1165,10824074,Association between early-onset Parkinson's disease and mutations in the parkin gene,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the parkin gene have recently been identified in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease, but the frequency of the mutations and the associated phenotype have not been assessed in a large series of patients. METHODS: We studied 73 families in which at least one of the affected family members was affected at or before the age of 45 years and had parents who were not affected, as well as 100 patients with isolated Parkinson's disease that began at or before the age of 45 years. All subjects were screened for mutations in the parkin gene with use of a semiquantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay that simultaneously amplified several exons. We sequenced the coding exons in a subgroup of patients. We also compared the clinical features of patients with parkin mutations and those without mutations. RESULTS: Among the families with early-onset Parkinson's disease, 36 (49 percent) had parkin mutations. The age at onset ranged from 7 to 58 years. Among the patients with isolated Parkinson's disease, mutations were detected in 10 of 13 patients (77 percent) with an age at onset of 20 years or younger, but in only 2 of 64 patients (3 percent) with an age at onset of more than 30 years. The mean (+/-SD) age at onset in the patients with parkin mutations was younger than that in those without mutations (32+/-11 vs. 42+/-11 years, P<0.001), and they were more likely to have symmetric involvement and dystonia at onset, to have hyperreflexia at onset or later, to have a good response to levodopa therapy, and to have levodopa-induced dyskinesias during treatment. Nineteen different rearrangements of exons (deletions and multiplications) and 16 different point mutations were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the parkin gene are a major cause of early-onset autosomal recessive familial Parkinson's disease and isolated juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (at or before the age of 20 years). Accurate diagnosis of these cases cannot be based only on the clinical manifestations of the disease.",0
1166,17662392,"Effect of the magnitude of lipid lowering on risk of elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and cancer: insights from large randomized statin trials","OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the relationship between the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering and rates of elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and cancer. BACKGROUND: Although it is often assumed that statin-associated adverse events are proportional to LDL-C reduction, that assumption has not been validated. METHODS: Adverse events reported in large prospective randomized statin trials were evaluated. The relationship between LDL-C reduction and rates of elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and cancer per 100,000 person-years was assessed using weighted univariate regression. RESULTS: In 23 statin treatment arms with 309,506 person-years of follow-up, there was no significant relationship between percent LDL-C lowering and rates of elevated liver enzymes (R2 <0.001, p = 0.91) or rhabdomyolysis (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.16). Similar results were obtained when absolute LDL-C reduction or achieved LDL-C levels were considered. In contrast, for any 10% LDL-C reduction, rates of elevated liver enzymes increased significantly with higher statin doses. Additional analyses demonstrated a significant inverse association between cancer incidence and achieved LDL-C levels (R2 = 0.43, p = 0.009), whereas no such association was demonstrated with percent LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.09, p = 0.92) or absolute LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of statin-associated elevated liver enzymes or rhabdomyolysis is not related to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering. However, the risk of cancer is significantly associated with lower achieved LDL-C levels. These findings suggest that drug- and dose-specific effects are more important determinants of liver and muscle toxicity than magnitude of LDL-C lowering. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits of low achieved levels of LDL-C may in part be offset by an increased risk of cancer.",1
1167,3974651,The long-term pulmonary sequelae of prematurity: the role of familial airway hyperreactivity and the respiratory distress syndrome,"Respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn, prematurity, and familial airway hyperreactivity may contribute to long-term pulmonary sequelae. We assessed the role of each by testing pulmonary function and airway reactivity in 11 prematurely born children who survived the respiratory distress syndrome and in 11 prematurely born children who had no neonatal respiratory disease, each of whom was paired with a sibling born at term. The subjects were between 7 and 12 years of age when studied. Airway reactivity was also assessed in their mothers. The group who had had the respiratory distress syndrome had higher ratios of residual volume to total lung capacity and lower values for forced expiratory volume in one second than did their siblings or normal controls (P less than 0.01). Expiratory flow was decreased in both groups born prematurely (P less than 0.02) and was related to neonatal exposure to oxygen (r = -0.71, P less than 0.02). The incidence of airway hyperreactivity was elevated in all groups, including the mothers. These data suggest that long-term pulmonary sequelae of the respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn are related to the disease, its treatment, or both, and to airway hyperreactivity. In prematurely born children without neonatal lung disease, the sequelae are related to airway hyperreactivity. The possibility of a relation between familial airway hyperreactivity and premature birth is suggested.",0

Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three mild hypothermic (MHT, 32 +/- 0.2 degrees C) groups, including intra-ischemia (MHTi), intra-reperfusion (MHTr), and intra-ischemia/reperfusion (MHTi + r) group, and one normothermic group (NT, 37 +/- 0.2 degrees C) as the control. Reversible focal ischemia was carried out in rats with suture model. The cortical blood flow was measured during 3 h of ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion. The permeability of brain blood barrier (BBB) was estimated after 3 h of reperfusion. The infarct volume was measured at 72 h after reperfusion to determine the effects of MHT. The acute post-ischemic hyperperfusion and delayed hypoperfusion in ischemic perifocal region and sustained hypoperfusion in ischemic core were inhibited in MHTi + r and MHTi rats (P < 0.05). MHTi + r protection on post-ischemic progressive hypoperfusion in the perifocal region was more effective than that of MHTi (P < 0.05). The BBB disruption and the infarct volume were significantly reduced in both MHTi and MHTi + r groups (P < 0.05), especially in the MHTi + r rats. This study demonstrates that MHTi + r has more substantial protective effects on reducing ischemia/reperfusion injury than MHTi. It may inhibit post-ischemic hyperperfusion and delayed or sustained hypoperfusion in ischemic perifocal regions, and reduce brain blood barrier disruption in the cortex region. ",0

METHODS: We examined fee-for-service Medicare data from 1992 through 2005 to identify beneficiaries 65 years of age or older who underwent CPR in U.S. hospitals. We examined temporal trends in the incidence of CPR and the rate of survival after CPR, as well as patient- and hospital-level predictors of survival to discharge. RESULTS: We identified 433,985 patients who underwent in-hospital CPR; 18.3% of these patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2 to 18.5) survived to discharge. The rate of survival did not change substantially during the period from 1992 through 2005. The overall incidence of CPR was 2.73 events per 1000 admissions; the incidence was higher among black and other nonwhite patients. The proportion of patients undergoing in-hospital CPR before death increased over time and was higher for nonwhite patients. The survival rate was lower among patients who were men, were older, had more coexisting illnesses, or were admitted from a skilled-nursing facility. The adjusted odds of survival for black patients were 23.6% lower than those for similar white patients (95% CI, 21.2 to 25.9). The association between race and survival was partially explained by hospital effects: black patients were more likely to undergo CPR in hospitals that have lower rates of post-CPR survival. Among patients surviving in-hospital CPR, the proportion of patients discharged home rather than to a health care facility decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after in-hospital CPR did not improve from 1992 through 2005. The proportion of in-hospital deaths preceded by CPR increased, whereas the proportion of survivors discharged home after undergoing CPR decreased. Black race was associated with higher rates of CPR but lower rates of survival after CPR.",0
1174,25561149,An exclusively based parenteral fish-oil emulsion reverses cholestasis,"Prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) leads to liver damage. Recent interest has focused on the lipid component of PN. A lipid emulsion based on w-3 fatty acids decrease conjugated bilirubin. A mixed lipid emulsion derived from soybean, coconut, olive, and fish oils reverses jaundice. Here we report the reversal of cholestasis and the improvement of enteral feeding tolerance in 1 infant with intestinal failure-associated liver disease. Treatment involved the substitution of a mixed lipid emulsion with one containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids during 37 days. Growth and biochemical tests of liver function improved significantly. This suggests that fat emulsions made from fish oils may be more effective means of treating this condition compared with an intravenous lipid emulsion containing soybean oil, medium -chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil.  La nutrición parenteral prolongada produce daño hepático. Recientemente se ha comunicado el efecto de las emulsiones lipídicas intravenosas basadas exclusivamente en ácidos grasos omega-3 en la resolución de la colestasis.

1175,21584420,Liver toxicity is rare in rheumatoid arthritis patients using combination therapy with leflunomide and methotrexate,"OBJECTIVE: Some studies have reported that adding leflunomide (LEF) to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who do not respond to methotrexate (MTX) improved efficacy but increased the risk of liver toxicity. This study aimed at assessing the incidence of liver toxicity in patients with active RA using the LEF and MTX combination therapy in comparison with that of patients on MTX monotherapy. METHODS: Between February and September 2009, 97 consecutive patients followed up at the University Hospital of the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil, were enrolled. RA patients on MTX alone or using the LEF and MTX combination had their medical records systematically reviewed. The alanine/aspartate aminotransferase enzymes were retrospectively analyzed since the beginning of treatment with MTX or MTX plus LEF. Hepatotoxicity was defined as an increase of at least two-fold the upper limits of normal of the liver enzymes. RESULTS: 71 RA patients were included in the study: 36.6% were using 20-25 mg/week of MTX alone and 63.4% were using 20-25 mg/week of MTX plus 20 mg/day of LEF. Of the patients on the combination therapy, 11.1% had abnormal levels of liver enzymes versus 11.5% of the patients on monotherapy (P = 1.0). Abnormal aminotransferase levels have been seen with both MTX and LEF monotherapies in patients with RA. In our study, no difference was found between the percentages of aminotransferase elevations of patients being treated with MTX alone or in combination with LEF. CONCLUSION: The combination of MTX and LEF in RA patients is generally safe and well tolerated.",1

There has been recent FDA approval of agents to stimulate salivation (pilocarpine and cevimeline) and studies are in progress to determine their role in the treatment of dry eye. New therapies are in clinical trials for ocular manifestations with the most interest focused on topical cyclosporin A and purinogenic receptor agonists. In oral therapy, topical human interferon has reported encouraging results in short-term studies. However, the high placebo response (probably reflecting the beneficial response of mechanical stimulation of the buccal mucosa by the lozenge) and the response to much cheaper therapies (such as acid maltose lozenges) may offer safer and cheaper alternatives. For systemic disease, there is interest in tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. However, the cost-effectiveness and safety of biological agents needs longer term follow up, as they appear much less dramatic in their effect on systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjogren's syndrome than in rheumatoid arthritis.",1

1178,24157994,Beware of paracetamol use in alcohol abusers: a potential cause of acute liver injury,"""There may be under-recognition of acute liver injury following reported therapeutic use of paracetamol in alcoholics. We present the case of an alcoholic patient who developed acute liver injury suspicious for chronic paracetamol toxicity on two occasions. The likely contribution of chronic paracetamol was not recognised at her second presentation, reflecting a need for increased awareness of this potential cause of acute liver injury. The biochemical hallmark of the syndrome is the 'towering' aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), often in the thousands; transaminases above 500 U/L should never be dismissed as secondary to alcoholic liver disease alone. Whether alcoholics are at increased risk of toxicity from therapeutic doses of paracetamol remains controversial, although many cases have been described for over 30 years. Randomised controlled trials to date have failed to show significant hepatic derangement in newly abstinent alcoholics exposed to short courses of paracetamol. We argue that these studies do not reflect the realities of paracetamol use in this population. In addition, alcoholics are at risk of accidental 'staggered overdoses', or repeated supra-therapeutic ingestions. In cases of suspected paracetamol toxicity, administration of the antidote n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) should be considered, even when the patient's serum paracetamol level is normal.""",1

The mean circadian levels of plasma glucose, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, and M values (defined in Methods) did not significantly differ among the three regimens. Although these levels in the diabetic subjects approximated those in the normal subjects, the levels of plasma insulin, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, and M values were significantly higher than those in normal subjects (P < 0.01). Therefore, at least on a short-term basis, all three regimens can produce comparable, nearly normal levels of blood sugar in such patients; moreover, closed-loop devices can be used to determine insulin requirements for conventional therapy.""",0
1181,24694233,Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) pharmacogenomic tests: potential and pitfalls,"Adverse drug reactions involving a range of prescribed drugs and affecting the skin, liver and other organs show strong associations with particular HLA alleles. For some reactions, HLA typing prior to prescription, so that those positive for the risk allele are not given the drug associated with the reaction, shows high positive and negative predictive values. The best example of clinical implementation relates to the hypersensitivity reaction induced by the anti-HIV drug abacavir. When this reaction is phenotyped accurately, 100% of those who develop it are positive for HLA-B*57:01. Drug regulators worldwide now recommend genotyping for HLA-B*57:01 before abacavir is prescribed. Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis can be induced by carbamazepine and other anticonvulsant drugs. In certain East Asians, these reactions are significantly associated with HLA-B*15:02, and typing for this allele is now recommended prior to carbamazepine prescription in these populations. Other HLA associations have been described for skin rash induced by carbamazepine, allopurinol and nevirapine and for liver injury induced by flucloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, lapatanib, lumiracoxib and ticlopidine. However, the predictive values for typing HLA alleles associated with these adverse reactions are lower. Clinical implementation therefore seems unlikely. Performing HLA typing is relatively complex compared with genotyping assays for single nucleotide polymorphisms. With emphasis on HLA-B*57:01, the approaches used commonly, including use of sequence-specific oligonucleotide PCR primers and DNA sequencing are considered, together with their successful implementation. Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging HLA alleles is a simpler alternative to HLA typing but appears insufficiently accurate for clinical use.",1

1183,20664046,Treatment of primary Sj�gren syndrome: a systematic review,"""CONTEXT: A variety of topical and systemic drugs are available to treat primary Sj�gren syndrome, although no evidence-based therapeutic guidelines are currently available. OBJECTIVE: To summarize evidence on primary Sj�gren syndrome drug therapy from randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles on drug therapy for primary Sj�gren syndrome published between January 1, 1986, and April 30, 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled trials of topical and systemic drugs including adult patients with primary Sj�gren syndrome were selected as the primary information source. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 37 trials. A placebo-controlled trial found significant improvement in the Schirmer and corneal staining scores, blurred vision, and artificial tear use in patients treated with topical ocular 0.05% cyclosporine. Three placebo-controlled trials found that pilocarpine was associated with improvements in dry mouth (61%-70% vs 24%-31% in the placebo group) and dry eye (42%-53% vs 26%). Two placebo-controlled trials found that cevimeline was associated with improvement in dry mouth (66%-76% vs 35%-37% in the placebo group) and dry eye (39%-72% vs 24%-30%). Small trials (<20 patients) found no significant improvement in sicca outcomes for oral prednisone or hydroxychloroquine and limited benefits for immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine and cyclosporine). A large trial found limited benefits for oral interferon alfa-2a. Two placebo-controlled trials of infliximab and etanercept did not achieve the primary outcome (a composite visual analog scale measuring joint pain, fatigue, and dryness); neither did 2 small trials (<30 patients) testing rituximab, although significant results were observed in some secondary outcomes and improvement compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In primary Sj�gren syndrome, evidence from controlled trials suggests benefits for pilocarpine and cevimeline for sicca features and topical cyclosporine for moderate or severe dry eye. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have not shown clinical efficacy, and larger controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of rituximab.""",1

METHODS: We analyzed 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the toll-like receptor 2 gene (TLR2), the toll-like receptor 3 gene (TLR3), the toll-like receptor 4 gene (TLR4), and the toll-like receptor 9 gene (TLR9) in a cohort of 336 recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants and their unrelated donors. The risk of invasive aspergillosis was assessed with the use of multivariate Cox regression analysis. The analysis was replicated in a validation study involving 103 case patients and 263 matched controls who received hematopoietic-cell transplants from related and unrelated donors. RESULTS: In the discovery study, two donor TLR4 haplotypes (S3 and S4) increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted hazard ratio for S3, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 4.25; P=0.02; adjusted hazard ratio for S4, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.26; P=0.002). The haplotype S4 was present in carriers of two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (1063 A/G [D299G] and 1363 C/T [T399I]) that influence TLR4 function. In the validation study, donor haplotype S4 also increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.41; P=0.02); the association was present in unrelated recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.04 to 24.01; P=0.04) but not in related recipients (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 0.93 to 5.68; P=0.07). In the discovery study, seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in donors or recipients, donor positivity for S4, or both, as compared with negative results for CMV and S4, were associated with an increase in the 3-year probability of invasive aspergillosis (12% vs. 1%, P=0.02) and death that was not related to relapse (35% vs. 22%, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between the donor TLR4 haplotype S4 and the risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants from unrelated donors.",0
1185,2388667,Cyclosporine-induced sympathetic activation and hypertension after heart transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a frequent complication of cyclosporine-induced immunosuppression, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In anesthetized animals, the administration of cyclosporine increases sympathetic-nerve discharge, which may contribute to hypertension. METHODS: To determine whether cyclosporine-induced hypertension is accompanied by sustained sympathetic neural activation in patients, we recorded sympathetic action potentials using intraneural microelectrodes (in the peroneal nerve) in heart-transplant recipients receiving azathioprine and prednisone alone (n = 5) or in combination with cyclosporine (n = 14). We performed the same studies in eight patients with myasthenia gravis who were receiving cyclosporine and eight who were not, in five patients with essential hypertension, and in nine normal controls. RESULTS: Heart-transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine had higher mean arterial blood pressure (+/- SE) than those not receiving cyclosporine (112 +/- 3 vs. 96 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) and a 2.7-fold higher rate of sympathetic-nerve firing (80 +/- 3 vs. 30 +/- 4 bursts per minute; P less than 0.05). For patients with myasthenia gravis, similar doses of cyclosporine were associated with smaller elevations in mean arterial blood pressure (100 +/- 2 mm Hg, as compared with 91 +/- 4 mm Hg in those not receiving cyclosporine; P less than 0.05) and in the rate of sympathetic-nerve firing (46 +/- 3 bursts per minute, as compared with 25 +/- 4 bursts per minute; P less than 0.05). Sympathetic activity in patients with heart transplants or myasthenia gravis who were not being treated with cyclosporine was no different from that in patients with essential hypertension or in normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine-induced hypertension is associated with sympathetic neural activation, which may be accentuated by the cardiac denervation that results from heart transplantation.",0
1186,16278718,"Quinine allergy causing acute severe systemic illness: report of 4 patients manifesting multiple hematologic, renal, and hepatic abnormalities","Quinine is widely used for the common symptom of leg cramps. Quinine tablets require a prescription, but quinine and the product from which it is derived, cinchona, are also available without prescription. They are components of over-the-counter remedies for many common symptoms, of nutrition products, and of beverages such as tonic water and bitter lemon. Although quinine has been used for centuries, initially as an extract from the bark of the cinchona tree, allergic reactions to quinine can be severe and can affect multiple organs. These allergic reactions can cause thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, liver toxicity, and neurological abnormalities. Because quinine use is often intermittent, defining quinine as a cause of an acute disorder may be difficult. Moreover, since quinine use is often self-regulated, patients may not mention it in response to direct questions about medication use, adding to diagnostic difficulty. The diversity and severity of quinine-associated disorders and the difficulties of diagnosis are illustrated by the presentation of 4 case histories. Awareness of the variety of potential quinine-associated reactions is important for accurate diagnosis and critical for prevention of recurrent illness.",1

METHOD﻿S: Finite element model of the skull and the implants were created using ANSYS software. The finite element model thus built composed of 537692 elements and 115694 nodes in RME model & 543078 elements and 117948 nodes with implants model. The forces were applied on the palatal surface of the posterior teeth to cause 5mm of transverse displacement on either side of the palatal halves, making it a total of 10mm. The stresses and the displacement values were obtained and interpreted. Varying pattern of stress and the displacements with both positive and negative values were seen. The maximum displacement was seen in the case of plain RME model and that too at Pterygomaxillary suture and Mid-palatal suture in descending order. In the case of I-RME maximum displacement was seen at Zygomaticomaxillary suture followed by Pterygomaxillary suture. The displacements produced in all the three planes of space for the plain RME model were greater in comparison to the Implant Supported RME model. And the stresses remained high for all the sutures in case of an I-RME. There is a definite difference in the stress and the displacement pattern produced by RME and I-RME model and each can be used according to the need of the patient. The stresses generated in case of conventional RME were considerably less than that of the I-RME for all the sutures. ",0
1188,15122750,Expression of the CXCR3 ligand I-TAC by hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis C and its correlation with hepatic inflammation,"The factors that regulate lymphocyte traffic in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) are not completely defined. Interferon (IFN)-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) is a relatively new member of the CXCR3 chemokine ligand family that selectively recruits activated T cells to sites of inflammation. To determine if I-TAC plays a role in CHC, we investigated I-TAC expression in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver biopsy material. I-TAC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly increased in HCV-infected liver compared with normal liver, which correlated with both portal and lobular inflammation. I-TAC expression was localized to hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule, with those in close proximity to active areas of inflammation expressing the highest concentration of I-TAC. In vitro, I-TAC mRNA and protein expression was inducible in Huh-7 cells following either IFN-alpha or -gamma stimulation and synergistically with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Furthermore, transfection of Huh-7 cells with either poly(I:C) or HCV RNA representing the HCV subgenomic replicon induced I-TAC mRNA expression. HCV replication was also found to modulate I-TAC expression, with stimulation of Huh-7 cells harboring either the HCV subgenomic or genomic replicon showing significantly increased synergistic effects compared with those previously seen in Huh-7 cells alone with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In conclusion, these results suggest I-TAC, one of the most potent chemoattractants for activated T cells, is produced by hepatocytes in the HCV-infected liver and plays an important role in T cell recruitment and ultimately the pathogenesis of CHC.",0

1190,2143270,The life expectancy of profoundly handicapped people with mental retardation,"BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with mental retardation is shorter than that of the general population. Exact estimates of the length of survival for mentally retarded persons at especially high risk are not available, however. METHODS: We collected data on mortality and other factors for 99,543 persons with developmental disabilities, including mental retardation, who received services from the California Department of Developmental Services between March 1984 and October 1987. Three subgroups were selected on the basis of the four characteristics identified in previous studies as the best predictors of mortality among mentally retarded people (deficits in cognitive function, limitations on mobility, incontinence, and inability to eat without assistance). In all three subgroups, the subjects had severe deficits in cognitive function and were incontinent; the subjects in subgroup 1 (n = 1550) were immobile and required tube feeding; those in subgroup 2 (n = 4513) were immobile but could eat with assistance; those in subgroup 3 (n = 997) were mobile (but not ambulatory) and could eat with assistance. Life tables were generated for each of the three subgroups. RESULTS: Immobile subjects were found to have a much shorter life expectancy than those who could move about. Those who also required tube feeding (subgroup 1) had a very short life expectancy (i.e., four to five additional years). Those who could eat if fed by others (subgroup 2) had an average life expectancy of approximately eight additional years. In contrast, those who were mobile though not ambulatory (subgroup 3) had a life expectancy of about 23 additional years. CONCLUSIONS: Severe mental retardation is associated with a decrease in life expectancy, particularly for those who were immobile.",0
1191,26809244,Elotuzumab: First Global Approval,"Elotuzumab (Empliciti�) is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and AbbVie that has been approved as combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the US. Elotuzumab binds to the cell surface receptor signalling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7), which is selectively expressed on myeloma cells and natural killer cells, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and direct natural killer cell activation. In a phase III clinical trial, addition of elotuzumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall response rate. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of elotuzumab leading to this first approval for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.",1
1192,28938865,"Binding of ibuprofen to human hemoglobin: elucidation of their molecular recognition by spectroscopy, calorimetry, and molecular modeling techniques","Ibuprofen, used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and related conditions has ample affinity to globular proteins. Here we have explored this fundamental study pertaining to the interaction of ibuprofen with human hemoglobin (HHb), using multispectroscopic, calorimetric, and molecular modeling techniques to gain insights into molecular aspects of binding mechanism. Ibuprofen-induced graded decrease in absorption spectra indicates protein disruption along with sedimentation of HHb particle. Red shifting of absorption peak at 195 nm indicates alteration in the secondary structure of HHb upon interaction with ibuprofen. Flouremetric and isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) studies suggested one binding site in HHb for ibuprofen at 298.15 K. However, with increase in temperature, ITC revealed increasing number of binding sites. The negative values of Gibbs energy change (ΔG ",0
1193,20707932,Acute-on-chronic liver failure due to thiamazole in a patient with hyperthyroidism and trilogy of Fallot: case report,"BACKGROUND: Thiamazole is a widely used antithyroid agent that has been approved for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Although thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity is a main side effect, it may progress to liver failure in a very few cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a 24-year-old patient with hyperthyroidism and trilogy of Fallot, who developed liver failure due to thiamazole. Liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis, mild inflammatory infiltrates, as well as significant fibrosis, indicating both acute and chronic liver injuries. Although a series of potent therapies were given, the patient deceased due to severe liver decompensation. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity in the setting of advanced fibrosis increases the risk of poor outcome. Regular liver function monitoring during thiamazole therapy is therefore important.",1

1195,1010464,Analysis by computer-controlled cell sorter of Friend virus-transformed cells in different stages of differentiation,"In most systems involving cellular differentiation and cellular transformation the biological process is non-synchronous and the sample heterogeneous. In order to answer some of the basic questions about the control mechanisms of cellular changes and the order in which they proceed one must have access to homogeneous classes of cells. Friend virus transformed erythroid cells which are stably maintained in tissue culture can be chemically induced to differentiate and are thus very advantageous for in vitro studies (1-3). With such a system the questions which we pose are a) the reversibility of the differentiation process; b) the order of steps in the production of specialized messenger RNA; c) the time of shut-off of undifferentiated messenger production; d) the relationship of viral RNA production to the differentiation process; e) the onset and extent of specific protein synthesis; f) the correlation of DNA metabolism with the timing or course of events. By using a computer-controlled cell separator we can select live cells on the basis of their macromolecular content, membrane properties (using a new parameter, fluorescence emission anisotropy), and size (4, 5, 34). Thus with proper probes as described here, we are able to select cells at different stages in their differentiation and can begin to attack the questions posed above. ",0
1196,10363854,Economic and resource utilization analysis of outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in low-risk pediatric patients with cancer,"To measure resource allocation in outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in low-risk pediatric patients with cancer and its impact on their families. A prospective clinical trial was conducted. Eligible patients received a single dose of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and were observed for several hours in clinic. Patients were randomly assigned to continue either IV or oral antibiotics and were seen daily as outpatients. Charges were calculated based on the number of resources used and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement schedules. A questionnaire was used to measure the impact of outpatient treatment on the family. Seventy-three episodes of fever and neutropenia were studied. The median duration of treatment was 4 days. Eighty-six percent of the episodes were managed without hospitalization. The median calculated charge was $1840. The median calculated charge for patients receiving oral antibiotics was $1544 and was significantly less than the $2039 median charge for outpatients treated with IV antibiotics. The estimated charge for comparable inpatient treatment was $4503. Nearly all families preferred outpatient care, and few reported a loss of work hours or increased child care expenses. Outpatient treatment of low-risk episodes of fever and neutropenia is substantially less costly than inpatient care and is preferred by most families. ",0
1197,15051203,Comparison of the clinical diagnosis of diabetic macular edema with diagnosis by optical coherence tomography,"To compare the diagnosis of diabetic macular edema (DME) by stereoscopic slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the fundus with a 78-diopter noncontact lens with diagnosis by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Prospective, double-masked, noninterventional diagnostic study. Analysis of slit-lamp biomicroscopic findings compared with OCT measurements. Patients with DME from a private retina practice. Presence or absence of macular thickening. The reference range for this clinic was comparable to reference ranges published from other clinics. The clinical detection of DME was less than detection by OCT. Chance-corrected agreements (kappa statistic) of the 2 methods were 0.63 for the foveal zone and 0.36 to 0.42 for the 4 parafoveal zones. The errors committed in clinical examination were primarily of the type in which clinical examination did not detect DME but OCT did (58%-90%) for the 5 zones analyzed. Reference ranges for OCT seem to be similar for different clinical settings, suggesting the usefulness of OCT in multicenter studies. The current standard of care for DME detection, stereoscopic slit-lamp examination of the fundus, is less sensitive than OCT for detection of DME. Because the principal therapy for DME, focal laser photocoagulation, is mainly sight preserving and not sight restoring, the wider use of OCT may beneficially impact visual disability from DME. ",0
1198,16527695,Effect of nitazoxanide in diarrhea and enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium species,"""BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nitazoxanide for the treatment of diarrhea and enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium species in patients 12 years of age and older. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 90 outpatients 12 years of age and older from the Nile Delta region of Egypt. Patients were randomized to receive either one 500 mg tablet or one matching placebo tablet, or 25 mL of nitazoxanide oral suspension (500 mg nitazoxanide), each given twice daily for 3 days. Clinical and microbiologic response rates were evaluated 4 days after completion of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (96%) of the 28 patients receiving nitazoxanide tablets responded clinically compared with 11 (41%) of 27 patients who received placebo (P < .0001). Twenty-six (93%) of the 28 patients who received nitazoxanide were free of Cryptosporidium oocysts in each of 2 posttreatment stool samples compared with only 10 (37%) of 27 patients who received placebo (P < .0001). Response rates in patients receiving the tablets and the suspension were comparable (clinical response rate for suspension, 27 of 31 [87%]; microbiologic response rate for suspension, 28 of 31 [90%]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a 3-day course of nitazoxanide is effective in treating diarrhea and enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium in nonimmunodeficient patients 12 years of age and older.""",1
1199,31393877,The trend in blood pressure and hypertension prevalence in the general population of South Kivu between 2012 and 2016: Results from two representative cross-sectional surveys-The Bukavu observational study,"Data on blood pressure trends are scarce or unavailable in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the dynamics in the prevalence and control of hypertension in a cohort of Congolese adults in South Kivu. Two phases of data collection were conducted including a baseline at the beginning in 2012 and a follow up in 2016. The subjects were ≥ 18 years old living in urban (n = 4413) or rural areas (n = 6453). Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg and/or taking antihypertensive medications. The crude prevalence of hypertension was age-adjusted to the WHO population. Between 2012 and 2016, there was a significant increase in blood pressure (+2.5/+1.4 mmHg; p = 0.001), age standardized prevalence of hypertension [19.0% vs. 18.0%; OR = 1.05 (1.02-1.08); p<0.0001], and obesity (7.9% to 9.8%; p<0.0001) as well as the proportion of subjects > 60 years old (8.8% to 11.3%; p<0.0001) and those with tachycardia (10.5% to 14.4%; p<0.0001). The number of subjects under treatment of hypertension were statistically non-significant [16.1% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.29), but the level of control of hypertension was significantly reduced by 32.4% in 2016 compared in 2012 (43.5% vs. 64.4%; p = 0.0008). There was an increase in the prevalence of hypertension as well as cardiovascular-associated risk factors in the population. However, this trend did not increase for treated subjects with no improvements in the level of AHT control. Therefore, improved strategies for the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases are very important in Sub-Saharan Africa. ",0
1200,11519625,The impact of familial alcoholism on alcohol reactivity in female social drinkers,"Some individuals may have an inherent reactivity to alcohol that facilitates early development of characteristics associated with alcoholism. Although response to alcohol cues has been used to assess this reactivity, few studies have included women or investigated familial alcoholism as a variable. In this study, 23 female college students were divided into groups according to family history of alcoholism (positive or negative). Alcohol reactivity was measured by salivation, skin temperature, heart rate, mood state, and craving for alcohol following presentation of alcohol-related and neutral cues. Results indicate no correlation between salivary reactivity and alcohol craving, which suggests that these variables tap into different domains of cue reactivity. Findings demonstrate that alcohol cue reactivity can be assessed in female social drinkers and that familial alcoholism may influence salivary reactivity to alcohol-related cues. ",0
1201,23869179,Clinical effectiveness of baclofen for the treatment of alcohol dependence: a review,"""Baclofen, an agonist at the B subunit of gaba-aminobutyric acid receptor, possesses pharmacologic properties that may confer utility for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Research suggests that not only can it be useful in promoting maintenance of alcohol abstinence but also it may play a key role in decreasing alcohol cravings and anxiety often associated with alcohol dependence. To assess the benefit of baclofen for alcohol dependence, a review of the literature was conducted to identify published data investigating this off-label treatment. Four randomized controlled trials to date have been published and were included in this review. Although primary outcomes differ between studies, patients randomized to baclofen experience higher rates of abstinence from alcohol than those taking placebo in two of the trials. Secondary analyses indicate that baclofen is safe in patients with alcohol dependence, including those with moderate to severe liver cirrhosis, and may provide beneficial anxiolytic effects. Despite some positive data, the largest available randomized controlled trial failed to find any differences between baclofen and placebo. In all studies, individuals with severe medical comorbidities, seizure disorders, and psychiatric disorders were excluded from trials, which may limit external validity. In summary, there may be beneficial effects from using baclofen for the treatment of alcohol dependence; however, limited conclusions can be drawn from the small number of studies currently available for review. Larger well-designed trials are needed to further define baclofen's role for the treatment of alcohol dependence.""",1
1202,18338080,Estimating morbidity rates from electronic medical records in general practice. Evaluation of a grouping system,"In this study, we evaluated the internal validity of EPICON, an application for grouping ICPC-coded diagnoses from electronic medical records into episodes of care. These episodes are used to estimate morbidity rates in general practice. Morbidity rates based on EPICON were compared to a gold standard; i.e. the rates from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We calculated the deviation from the gold standard for 677 prevalence and 681 incidence rates, based on the full dataset. Additionally, we examined the effect of case-based reasoning within EPICON using a comparison to a simple, not case-based method (EPI-0). Finally, we used a split sample procedure to evaluate the performance of EPICON. Morbidity rates that are based on EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard and show no systematic bias. The effect of case-based reasoning within EPICON is evident. The addition of case-based reasoning to the grouping system reduced both systematic and random error. Although the morbidity rates that are based on the split sample procedure show no systematic bias, they do deviate more from the gold standard than morbidity rates for the full dataset. Results from this study indicate that the internal validity of EPICON is adequate. Assuming that the standard is gold, EPICON provides valid outcomes for this study population. EPICON seems useful for registries in general practice for the purpose of estimating morbidity rates. ",0

Jaundice and marked increase in aminotransferases occurred after 6-8 weeks of treatment. Continuation of flutamide administration was associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy and a marked prolongation of prothrombin time. One of the patients died of acute liver failure and the other survived after prolonged hospitalization. Rechallenge was not performed because of the severity of the clinical picture. Liver histology showed extensive hepatic necrosis. These two cases strongly suggest that flutamide, in addition to its cholestatic side effects, can induce acute hepatitis potentially with a fulminant and lethal course. Journal of Hepatology.",1

The metastases that progress after brain radiotherapy and HER2-targeted systemic therapy are a difficult therapeutic challenge. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib, an irreversible blocker of the ErbB protein family, alone or combined with vinorelbine, compared with treatment of the investigator's choice in women with HER2-positive breast cancer with progressive brain metastases during or after treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both. METHODS: We did this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial in 40 hospitals in Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea, and the USA. Women older than 18 years with histologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and CNS recurrence or progression as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) during or after treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both, were eligible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) centrally to afatinib 40 mg orally once per day, afatinib 40 mg per day plus intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) once per week, or investigator's choice of treatment in cycles of 3 weeks until disease progression, patient withdrawal, or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment assignment was not masked for clinicians or patients, but the trial team was masked until database lock to reduce bias. The primary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was patient benefit at 12 weeks, defined by an absence of CNS or extra-CNS disease progression, no tumour-related worsening of neurological signs or symptoms, and no increase in corticosteroid dose. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of a study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01441596. FINDINGS: Between Dec 22, 2011, and Feb 12, 2013, we screened 132 patients, of whom 121 were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 40 to afatinib alone, 38 to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 43 to investigator's choice. All patients discontinued study treatment before the data collection cutoff on Oct 16, 2014. Patient benefit was achieved in 12 (30?0%; 95% CI 16?6-46?5) patients given afatinib alone (difference vs investigator's choice: -11?9% [95% CI -32?9 to 9?7], p=0?37), 13 (34?2%; 19?6-51?4) given afatinib plus vinorelbine (difference vs investigator's choice: -7?6% [-28?9 to 14?2], p=0?63), and 18 (41?9%; 27?0-57?9) given investigator's choice. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (seven [18%] of 40 patients in the afatinib only group vs nine [24%] of 37 patients in the afatinib plus vinorelbine group vs two [5%] of 42 patients in the investigator's choice group) and neutropenia (none vs 14 [38%] vs four [10%]). INTERPRETATION: Patient benefit with afatinib-containing treatments was not different from that in patients given investigator's choice of treatments; however, adverse events were frequent and afatinib-containing treatments seemed to be less well tolerated. No further development of afatinib for HER2-positive breast cancer is currently planned. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.""",1

1207,26291180,Development of macitentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious, chronic condition that, without early recognition and treatment, leads to progressive right heart failure and death. The dual endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan was designed through a deliberate discovery process to maximize endothelin-axis blockade while improving adverse-effect profiles compared with previous compounds. Macitentan's efficacy was demonstrated in an event-driven morbidity and mortality study of treatment-naive and background PAH therapy-treated symptomatic patients. Compared to placebo, 10 mg of macitentan significantly reduced the relative risk of morbidity and mortality by 45%, primarily by delaying PAH worsening, most prominently in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II and III PAH patients. Macitentan reduced the incidence of the composite end point of PAH-related hospitalizations and mortality and improved WHO FC and exercise capacity (6-min walk distance). Furthermore, it significantly improved cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and quality of life, and had a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

The state of the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of the animals (in the hemagglutination inhibition test, the neutralization test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the skin allergic test with tetanin), as well as their resistance to challenge with C.tetani. The inhibiting effect of C.tetani on primary immune response to tetanus toxoid and their stimulating effect on secondary immune response have been established. This fact may be used for enhancing the quality of antitetanus preparations, such as toxoid and serum, as well as for working out tactical approaches for the rapid prevention of tetanus. ",0
1210,25687723,Epigenetic dimension of oxygen radical injury in spermatogonial epithelial cells,"The present work reports a direct role of mitochondrial oxidative stress induced aberrant chromatin regulation, as a central phenomenon, to perturbed genomic integrity in the testicular milieu. Oxygen-radical injury following N-succinimidyl N-methylcarbamate treatment in mouse spermatogonial epithelial (GC-1 spg) cells induced functional derailment of mitochondrial machinery. Mitophagy resulted in marked inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and reduced mtDNA copy number. Impaired cell cycle progression along with altered H3K9me1, H4K20me3, H3, AcH3 and uH2A histone modifications were observed in the treated cells. Dense heterochromatin foci and aberrant expression of HP1α in nuclei of treated cells implied onset of senescence associated secretory phenotype mediated through nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Neoplastic nature of daughter clones, emerged from senescent mother phenotypes was confirmed by cytogenetic instability, aberrant let-7a and let-7b miRNA expression and anchorage independent growth. Together, our results provide the first insights of redox-dependent epigenomic imbalance in spermatogonia, a previously unknown molecular paradigm.  ",0
1211,29890011,The Extraction and Recovery Efficiency of Pure DNA for Different Types of Swabs,"The extraction and recovery efficiency of swabs used to collect evidence at crime scenes is relatively low (typically <50%) for bacterial spores and body fluids. Cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an interesting alternative compared to whole cells as a source for forensic analysis, but extraction and recovery from swabs has not been tested before using pure DNA. In this study cotton, foam, nylon flocked, polyester and rayon swabs are investigated in order to collect pure DNA isolated from saliva samples. The morphology and absorption capacity of swabs is studied. Extraction and recovery efficiencies are determined and compared to the maximum theoretical efficiency. The results indicate that a substantial part of DNA is not extracted from the swab and some types of swab seem to bind effectively with DNA. The efficiency of the different types of swab never exceeds 50%. The nylon flocked 4N6FLOQSwab used for buccal sampling performs the best. ",0

The hypersensitivity syndrome is well recognized as being caused by anticonvulsants. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent whose side effects include sedation, weight gain, and increased creatinine kinase and transaminase levels. To date, there have been no reports of hypersensitivity syndrome related to this drug. A 34-year-old man developed a severe generalized pruritic skin eruption, fever, eosinophilia, and toxic hepatitis 60 days after ingestion of olanzapine. After termination of olanzapine treatment, the fever resolved, the skin rash was reduced, eosinophil count was reduced to normal, and the transaminase levels were markedly reduced.

The semiquantitative histological method showed a significant increase in pericellular collagen and in overall disease while morphometry showed a significant increase in pericellular, perivenular, and portal tract collagen. There was a significant correlation between the two methods, but morphometry had the advantage of objectivity and efficiency. There was no correlation between the increase in collagen and the accumulated dose of methotrexate, which suggests that other factors in addition to methotrexate may contribute to liver injury.",1
1214,16219898,Natalizumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and pivotal clinical trials for natalizumab in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted (1966-June 2005), and information was obtained from Iowa Drug Information Services. Additional data sources included meeting abstracts, bibliographies from identified articles, and information from the manufacturer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies and review articles examining natalizumab were evaluated. All published, randomized clinical trials evaluating natalizumab in MS and IBD were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Natalizumab is the first drug in a new class of agents called selective adhesion molecule inhibitors. It has shown promising results in MS and inflammatory bowel disease and appears superior compared with current therapies in reducing relapse rates. However, 3 recent, confirmed case reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) create concern about natalizumab's use in combination with existing therapies or in undefined patient subgroups. Natalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in March 2005 while the drug's safety is further evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Although long-term efficacy and safety of natalizumab have not been established, available data indicate that it is a novel drug for patients with MS or inflammatory bowel disease. Analysis of its possible association with PML will determine the risk-benefit evaluation and eventual place in therapy for natalizumab.",1
1215,19183227,Adjunctive lacosamide for partial-onset seizures: Efficacy and safety results from a randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide (200 and 400 mg/day) when added to one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients (age 16-70 years) with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization to placebo, lacosamide 200, or lacosamide 400 mg/day. The trial consisted of an 8-week baseline, a 4-week titration, and a 12-week maintenance period. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-five patients were randomized and received trial medication. Among these, 87% were taking two or more concomitant AEDs. Median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline to maintenance period (intent-to-treat, ITT) was 20.5% for placebo, 35.3% for lacosamide 200 mg/day (p = 0.02), and 36.4% for 400 mg/day (p = 0.03). In the per protocol population, the reductions were 35.3% for lacosamide 200 mg/day (p = 0.04) and 44.9% for 400 mg/day (p = 0.01) compared to placebo (25.4%). The 50% responder rate for lacosamide 400 mg/day (40.5%) was significant (p = 0.01) over placebo (25.8%), but was not for 200 mg/day (35.0%). In the per protocol population, the 50% responder rate for lacosamide 400 mg/day (46.3%) was significant (p < 0.01) compared with the placebo responder rate (27.5%). Dose-related adverse events (AEs) included dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Clinically relevant changes in the mean plasma concentrations of commonly used AEDs were not observed. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day and support that lacosamide may be an advantageous option for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy.",1

1217,18326978,Vascular compliance in the cardiometabolic syndrome,"Elevated systolic blood pressure and increased pulse pressure are important predictors of vascular stiffening (compliance), left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, vascular dementia, and chronic kidney disease. Advances in noninvasive methods that measure arterial stiffness have led to increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction and the development of associated risk factors. The ability to detect and monitor changes in the physical properties of arteries has the potential to allow early interventions that may prevent disease or attenuate its progression. In this paper, the authors briefly review the various methods available to measure vascular compliance and review pathologic processes that lead to insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and sympathetic activation, all of which may contribute to increased arterial stiffness in the cardiometabolic syndrome. Strategies to improve vascular compliance are also discussed. ",0
1218,17992543,"Iron-sulfur protein folds, iron-sulfur chemistry, and evolution","An inventory of unique local protein folds around Fe-S clusters has been derived from the analysis of protein structure databases. Nearly 50 such folds have been identified, and over 90% of them harbor low-potential [2Fe-2S](2+,+) or [4Fe-4S](2+,+) clusters. In contrast, high-potential Fe-S clusters, notwithstanding their structural diversity, occur in only three different protein folds. These observations suggest that the extant population of Fe-S protein folds has to a large extent been shaped in the reducing iron- and sulfur-rich environment that is believed to have predominated on this planet until approximately two billion years ago. High-potential active sites are then surmised to be rarer because they emerged later, in a more oxidizing biosphere, in conditions where iron and sulfide had become poorly available, Fe-S clusters were less stable, and in addition faced competition from heme iron and copper active sites. Among the low-potential Fe-S active sites, protein folds hosting [4Fe-4S](2+,+) clusters outnumber those with [2Fe-2S](2+,+) ones by a factor of 3 at least. This is in keeping with the higher chemical stability and versatility of the tetranuclear clusters, compared with the binuclear ones. It is therefore suggested that, at least while novel Fe-S sites are evolving within proteins, the intrinsic chemical stability of the inorganic moiety may be more important than the stabilizing effect of the polypeptide chain. The discovery rate of novel Fe-S-containing protein folds underwent a sharp increase around 1995, and has remained stable to this day. The current trend suggests that the mapping of the Fe-S fold space is not near completion, in agreement with predictions made for protein folds in general. Altogether, the data collected and analyzed here suggest that the extant structural landscape of Fe-S proteins has been shaped to a large extent by primeval geochemical conditions on one hand, and iron-sulfur chemistry on the other.

An association with HLA alleles has been identified with certain reactions, which makes it difficult to develop standardized preclinical tests to predict chemical liability. We have recently developed a T cell priming assay using the drug metabolite nitroso sulfamethoxazole (SMX-NO). We now report on reproducibility of the assay, establishment of a biobank of PBMC from 1000 HLA-typed volunteers, and generation of antigen-specific responses to a panel of compounds. Forty T cell priming assays were performed with SMX-NO; 5 gave weak responses (1.5-1.9) and 34 showed good (SI 2.0-3.9) or strong responses (SI ?> 4.0) using readouts for proliferation and cytokine release. Thus, SMX-NO can be used as a model reagent for in vitro T cell activation. Good to strong responses were also generated to haptenic compounds (amoxicillin, piperacillin and Bandrowski's base) that are not associated with an HLA risk allele. Furthermore, responses were detected to carbamazepine (in HLA-B*15:02 donors), flucloxacillin (in 1 HLA-B*57:01 donor) and oxypurinol (in HLA-B*58:01 donors), which are associated with HLA-class I-restricted forms of hypersensitivity. In contrast, na?ve T cell priming to ximelagatran, lumiracoxib, and lapatinib (HLA-class II-restricted forms of hypersensitivity) yielded negative results. Abacavir, which activates memory T cells in patients, did not activate na?ve T cells from HLA-B*57:01 donors. This work shows that the priming assay can be used to assess primary T cell responses to drugs and to study mechanisms T cell priming for drugs that display HLA class I restriction. Additional studies are required to investigate HLA-class II-restricted reactions.""",1
1222,25972490,Tetrahydrocannabinol for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: A randomized controlled trial,"""OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the treatment of dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients with dementia and clinically relevant NPS were randomly assigned to receive THC 1.5 mg or matched placebo (1:1) 3 times daily for 3 weeks. Primary outcome was change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), assessed at baseline and after 14 and 21 days. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received THC and 26 received placebo. NPS were reduced during both treatment conditions. The difference in reduction from baseline between THC and placebo was not significant (mean difference NPItotal: 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.6 to 10.0), nor were changes in scores for agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory 4.6, 95% CI -3.0 to 12.2), quality of life (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease -0.5, 95% CI -2.6 to 1.6), or activities of daily living (Barthel Index 0.6, 95% CI -0.8 to 1.9). The number of patients experiencing mild or moderate adverse events was similar (THC, n = 16; placebo, n = 14, p = 0.36). No effects on vital signs, weight, or episodic memory were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral THC of 4.5 mg daily showed no benefit in NPS, but was well-tolerated, which adds valuable knowledge to the scarce evidence on THC in dementia. The benign adverse event profile of this dosage allows study of whether higher doses are efficacious and equally well-tolerated. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with dementia-related NPS, low-dose THC does not significantly reduce NPS at 21 days, though it is well-tolerated.""",1

METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial in Japan, ninety-two patients received either simeprevir (50 or 100�mg QD) for 12 or 24�weeks with PegIFN?-2a/RBV for 24 or 48�weeks (according to response-guided therapy [RGT] criteria), or PegIFN?-2a/RBV for 48�weeks (PR48 group). RESULTS: Compared with the PR48 group, plasma HCV RNA reductions in the simeprevir groups were rapid and more substantial (Week 4: -5.2, -5.2 and -2.9 log10IU/mL for simeprevir 50�mg combined, 100�mg combined, and PR48 groups, respectively). High rapid virologic response rates (83, 90, and 8�% for simeprevir 50�mg combined, 100 mg combined, and PR48 groups, respectively) led to high sustained virologic response rates (77-92�%, compared with 46�% for PR48). All but one of the simeprevir-treated patients were eligible to complete treatment after 24�weeks (RGT). Relapse rates in simeprevir-treated patients were low (8-17�%, compared with 36�% for the PR48 group). There were no notable differences in the safety profile between the simeprevir and PR48 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of simeprevir QD to PegIFN?-2a/RBV, as compared with PegIFN?-2a/RBV alone, demonstrated potent antiviral activity and significantly improved the rates of sustained virologic response, with a shortened 24-week treatment duration, in treatment-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1 in Japan.

1226,6700669,Importance of raised growth hormone levels in mediating the metabolic derangements of diabetes,"To evaluate the importance of the raised levels of growth hormone that characterize poor diabetic control, we gave growth hormone for 21 to 45 hours in the form of hourly 100-micrograms pulses to 14 diabetics being treated by insulin pump. Insulin-pump settings and meals were kept constant. Mean 24-hour levels of growth hormone (+/- S.E.M.) rose from 8 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 2 ng per milliliter--values identical to those observed in 12 other patients with poorly controlled diabetes (17 +/- 3 ng per milliliter). Plasma glucose concentrations doubled within 8 to 10 hours and remained elevated until growth hormone was discontinued (fasting glucose level rose from 86 +/- 11 to 204 +/- 17 mg per deciliter at 18 hours and to 240 +/- 20 mg per deciliter at 42 hours). The hyperglycemia was due mainly to a marked stimulation of hepatic glucose production that occurred without changes in levels of free insulin or glucagon. Levels of circulating free fatty acids, ketones, and branched-chain amino acids were also increased. The moderate elevations in growth hormone levels that occur in poorly controlled diabetes can themselves reproduce the whole spectrum of abnormal metabolic fuel concentrations that are associated with poor diabetic control, despite optimized insulin treatment. Thus, hypersecretion of growth hormone may be the cause as much as the consequence of poor diabetic control.",0
1227,7682911,"Mefloquine. A review of its antimalarial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy","""Mefloquine is an orally administered blood schizontocide. Initial dose-finding and comparative studies performed between 1977 and 1989 demonstrated efficacy of mefloquine as prophylaxis in nonimmune individuals and in the suppression and treatment of malaria in adults and children caused by multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. It was also effective against P. vivax infection, while data concerning the treatment of P. ovale and P. malariae infections were limited. In an attempt to delay the emergence of resistance to this promising antimalarial agent, mefloquine was combined with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. Although initial clinical trials indicated that this regimen was effective in preventing and treating falciparum malaria, recent treatment failures, the potential for severe dermatological reactions and lack of therapeutic advantage over mefloquine alone has prompted the World Health Organization to recommended that the combination be no longer used for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria. Mefloquine is generally well tolerated in both adults and children, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, rash, pruritus and abdominal pain being the most common adverse effects, although it is difficult to distinguish between disease- and treatment-related events. The incidence of these adverse effects is similar to or lower than those observed with other antimalarial agents. Cardiovascular changes, such as bradycardia, occasionally occur. The most notable adverse effects associated with mefloquine are neuropsychiatric disturbances; precipitation of such events should be closely monitored and requires termination of prophylaxis or therapy. The eventual emergence of resistance to mefloquine, as with many other antimalarial agents, was inevitable. Mefloquine resistance is established in certain areas of Thailand and may be becoming a growing problem in other regions of the world. In order to preserve the efficacy of mefloquine in non-resistant areas, this useful agent should be used with care and only prescribed for prophylaxis in travellers and treatment in areas of multidrug-resistant plasmodia. Future options to combat mefloquine resistance may include the combination of mefloquine with other antimalarial agents such as qinghaosu derivatives. Thus, with cautious use and possible combination with other agents, mefloquine is likely to remain an important treatment option for falciparum malaria, a widespread parasitic disease for which an increasing number of drugs have proved inadequate.""",1

1229,8538706,Cohort studies of fat intake and the risk of breast cancer--a pooled analysis,"BACKGROUND: Experiments in animals, international correlation comparisons, and case-control studies support an association between dietary fat intake and the incidence of breast cancer. Most cohort studies do not corroborate the association, but they have been criticized for involving small numbers of cases, homogeneous fat intake, and measurement errors in estimates of fat intake. METHODS: We identified seven prospective studies in four countries that met specific criteria and analyzed the primary data in a standardized manner. Pooled estimates of the relation of fat intake to the risk of breast cancer were calculated, and data from study-specific validation studies were used to adjust the results for measurement error. RESULTS: Information about 4980 cases from studies including 337,819 women was available. When women in the highest quintile of energy-adjusted total fat intake were compared with women in the lowest quintile, the multivariate pooled relative risk of breast cancer was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16). Relative risks for saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat and for cholesterol, considered individually, were also close to unity. There was little overall association between the percentage of energy intake from fat and the risk of breast cancer, even among women whose energy intake from fat was less than 20 percent. Correcting for error in the measurement of nutrient intake did not materially alter these findings. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a positive association between total dietary fat intake and the risk of breast cancer. There was no reduction in risk even among women whose energy intake from fat was less than 20 percent of total energy intake. In the context of the Western lifestyle, lowering the total intake of fat in midlife is unlikely to reduce the risk of breast cancer substantially.",0

1231,31405314,The multiple roles of exosomes in Parkinson's disease: an overview,"The extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a relatively new field of research in neurodegenerative disease and they are thought to be one of the ways that neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), spread in the brain. EVs are membrane vesicles released from cells into the extracellular space and they are produced by all cells of the nervous tissue. The classification of the vesicle subtypes comprises exosomes, microvesicles/microparticles, apoptotic bodies. EVs change in number and content in response to environmental conditions and may function as shuttles for the delivery of cargo between cells. Recent data suggest that exosomes secreted by both activated microglia and neurons play an important role in α-synuclein (α-syn) spreading and increase of neuroinflammation, thus exacerbating neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. α-syn is a presynaptic protein secreted by neurons in small amounts, and it is the main component of Lewy bodies, one of the histopathological features of PD.

1232,25426292,Uncontrollable behavior or mental illness? Exploring constructions of bulimia using Q methodology,"""In medical and psychological literature bulimia is commonly described as a mental illness. However, from a social constructionist perspective the meaning of bulimia will always be socially and historically situated and multiple. Thus, there is always the possibility for other understandings or constructions of bulimia to circulate in our culture, with each having distinct real-world implications for those engaging in bulimic behaviors; for instance, they might potentially influence likelihood of help-seeking and the success of treatment. This study used Q methodology to explore culturally-available constructions of bulimia nervosa. Seventy-seven adults with varying experience of eating disorders took part in this Q methodological study. Online, they were asked to rank-order 42 statements about bulimia, and then answer a series of questions about the task and their knowledge of bulimia. A by-person factor analysis was then conducted, with factors extracted using the centroid technique and a varimax rotation. Six factors satisfied selection criteria and were subsequently interpreted. Factor A, """"bulimia as uncontrolled behavior"""", positions bulimia as a behavioral rather than psychological issue. Factor B, entitled """"bulimia is a distressing mental illness"""", reflects an understanding of bulimic behaviors as a dysfunctional coping mechanism, which is often found in psychological literature. Other perspectives position bulimia as about """"self-medicating with food"""" (Factor C), """"the pathological pursuit of thinness"""" (Factor D), """"being the best at being thin"""" (Factor E), or as """"extreme behavior vs. mentally ill"""" (Factor F). These constructions have distinct implications for the subjective experience and behavior of those engaged in bulimic behaviors, with some constructions possibly being more useful in terms of help-seeking (Factor B), while others position these individuals in ways that may be distressing, for instance as shallow (Factor D) or to blame (Factor E). This study has identified a range of distinct constructions of bulimia. These constructions are considered to have implications for the behaviors and experiences of those engaging in bulimic behaviors. As such, further research into constructions of bulimia may illuminate factors that influence help-seeking and the self-perceptions of such individuals. """,0
1233,11786978,Cis-preferential recruitment of duck hepatitis B virus core protein to the RNA/polymerase preassembly complex,"Hepadnaviral replication requires the concerted action of the polymerase and core proteins to ensure selective packaging of the RNA pregenome into nucleocapsids. Virus assembly is initiated by cis-preferential binding of polymerase to the encapsidation signal straightepsilon, present on pregenomic RNA. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model, we analyzed how core protein is recruited to the RNA/polymerase preassembly complex. Two sets of trans-complementation assays were performed in cotransfected hepatoma cells. First, a replication-competent DHBV construct was tested for its ability to rescue replication of genomes bearing mutations within the core region. Self-packaging of wild-type pregenomes was more efficient than cross-packaging of core-deficient pregenomes, and this bias was strongly enhanced if mutant pregenomes coded for self-assembly-competent, but packaging-deficient, core proteins. Second, the site of wild-type core protein translation, i.e., pregenomic RNA (cis) or separate messenger RNA (trans), was analyzed for its effect on the phenotype of a previously described dominant-negative (DN) DHBV core protein mutant. This mutant forms chimeric nucleocapsids with wild-type core proteins and blocks reverse transcription within most, but not all, mixed particles. Strikingly, suppression of viral DNA synthesis by the mutant increased 100-fold when wild-type core protein was provided in trans. Our results suggest that recruitment of core protein to the DHBV preassembly complex occurs in a cis-preferential manner. This mechanism may account for the leakiness of DN DHBV core protein mutants targeting reverse transcription.",0

In this report we provide evidence for the in vivo immunogenicity of the P0 protein in head and neck cancer patients as well as overexpression by immunohistochemistry of the C-22 P0 epitope in invasive carcinomas (55/57). Overexpression of this epitope was also significantly associated with a number of pathological lesions arising in the head and neck stratified epithelium including acanthosis (8/8), benign tumors (11/11), dysplasia (23/25) and in situ carcinomas (9/9). Intermediate cell layer restricted epitope overexpression was observed in well differentiated carcinomas, while undifferentiated tumors showed overexpression throughout the cell layers. Employing recombinant P proteins, sera from 40 of the 57 carcinoma patients and 39 normal donors, were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunity to P0 protein (7/40) was associated with malignancy and with advanced disease stage, but it was not dependent on the C-22 P0 epitope overexpression, although it was the preferential autoantibody target in 4 patients. Increased expression of the C-22 P0 epitope on the surface of pharynx cancer cells following cellular stress in vitro, may imply P0 protein presentation as an in vivo autoantibody target in cancer patients. Evidence for immunity to the P0 protein, as well as overexpression in patients with head and neck carcinoma may be relevant for monitoring cancer progression, in planning immunotherapeutic strategies, and contribute to the understanding of immuno-biological behaviour of head and neck carcinomas.

No behavioral benefits were observed, except for -2.72 (95% CI -4.92 to -0.52) in the 10 mg daily donepezil group and -1.72 (95% CI -3.12 to -0.33) for 24 mg daily galantamine trial. Only 5 mg daily donepezil had no effect on the function outcome. Compared with placebo, more dropouts and adverse events occurred with the cholinesterase inhibitors, but not with memantine. CONCLUSIONS: Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are able to stabilize or slow decline in cognition, function, behavior, and global change.",1

1238,24311269,"A rapid method for isolation of purified, physiologically active chloroplasts, used to study the intracellular distribution of amino acids in pea leaves","A procedure is described for the rapid (<5 min) isolation of purified, physiologically active chloroplasts from Pisum sativum L. Mitochondrial and microbody contamination is substantially reduced and broken chloroplasts are excluded by washing through a layer containing a treated silica sol. On average the preparations contain 93% intact chloroplasts and show high rates of (14)CO2 fixation and CO2-dependent O2 evolution (over 100 μmol/mg chlorophyll(chl)/h); they are also able to carry out light-driven incorporation of leucine into protein (4 nmol/mg chl/h). The amino-acid contents of chloroplasts prepared from leaves and from leaf protoplasts have been determined. Asparagine is the most abundant amino acid in the pea chloroplast (>240 nmol/mg chl), even thought it is proportionately lower in the chloroplast relative to the rest of the cell. The chloroplasts contain about 20% of many of the amino acids of the cell, but for individual amino acids the percentage in the chloroplast ranges from 8 to 40% of the cell total. Glutamic acid, glutamine and aspartic acid are enriched in the chloroplasts, while asparagine, homoserine and β-(isoxazolin-5-one-2-yl)-alanine are relatively lower. Leakage of amino acids from the chloroplast during preparation or repeated washing was ca. 20%. Some differences exist between the amino-acid composition of chloroplasts isolated from intact leaves and from protoplasts. In particular, γ-aminobutyric acid accumulates to high levels, while homoserine and glutamic acid decrease, during protoplast formation and breakage.  ",0

The patients (N = 652) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to paliperidone palmitate at 25, 100, or 150 mg eq. or placebo in this 13-week double-blind study. The patients received an injection of paliperidone palmitate at 150 mg eq. or placebo in the deltoid muscle on day 1 and the assigned fixed dose or placebo in the deltoid or gluteal [corrected] on day 8 and then once monthly (days 36 and 64). No oral supplementation was used. Target plasma levels were achieved by day 8 in all paliperidone palmitate groups. The mean change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score from baseline to end point improved significantly (P < or = 0.034) in all the paliperidone palmitate dose-groups versus placebo. Paliperidone palmitate treatment with this revised dosing regimen led to the achievement of rapid and consistent therapeutically effective plasma levels that were maintained by once-monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (> or =2% of patients in any of the treatment groups) that occurred more frequently in the total paliperidone palmitate group versus the placebo group (with > or =1% difference) were injection-site pain (7.6% vs 3.7%), dizziness (2.5% vs 1.2%), sedation (2.3% vs 0.6%), pain in the extremity (1.6% vs 0.0%), and myalgia (1.0% vs 0.0%). The paliperidone palmitate treatment was efficacious and generally tolerated across the dose range (25, 100, or 150 mg eq.) in adult patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia.",1

1244,15061685,Safety of tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonists,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is synthesised by a variety of cell types in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli. Although TNFalpha plays an adaptive role in immune protection and wound healing at 'physiological' levels, excess TNFalpha production can lead to adverse consequences. TNFalpha is a pivotal cytokine involved in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNFalpha antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA and the US FDA has approved three TNFalpha antagonists, etanercept, infliximab, and most recently, adalimumab, for the treatment of RA. However, differences have emerged, with respect to their demonstrated efficacy in other diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease). Worldwide, over half a million patients have been treated with TNFalpha antagonists and concerns regarding their safety have been raised. There is a risk of reactivation of granulomatous diseases, especially tuberculosis, with all three agents and appropriate measures should be taken for detection and treatment of latent infections. An association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and treatment with TNFalpha antagonists has been reported, although patients with active, long-standing RA are already known to have an increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. No associations with solid tumours have been found to date. The biological plausibility of lymphomas associated with immunomodulatory agents raises concern and vigilance is appropriate until the relationship is fully characterised. Large phase II and III trials have shown a detrimental effect of TNFalpha antagonists in advanced heart failure and these agents should be avoided in this population. Rare case reports of drug-induced lupus, seizure disorder, pancytopenia and demyelinating diseases have been noted after TNFalpha antagonists and continued vigilance is warranted in patients on TNFalpha antagonists for the development of these diseases. At present there is no evidence implicating TNFalpha antagonists with embryotoxicity, teratogenicity or increased pregnancy loss.",1

METHODS: Patients included in an international compassionate use programme for treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir?ribavirin for 24 weeks were prospectively studied. Serum hepatitis C virus RNA was measured at treatment weeks 4, 12, and 24 and during follow-up at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: Twelve patients (3 with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and 9 with cirrhosis; median model for end-stage liver disease score 20) received sofosbuvir 400mg/day+daclatasvir 60mg/day, and 6 patients (50%) also received ribavirin 200-800mg/day. Nine patients completed 24 weeks of treatment (75%), and all had undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA at week 24; 3 patients died (25%, liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and sepsis); 4 patients experienced severe liver disease-related adverse events. Post-treatment hepatitis C virus RNA was available for 5 patients (week 8, n=2; week 4, n=3) and was undetectable in all cases. Mean Child-Pugh score and albumin level improved significantly at week 24. No changes in immunosuppressant doses were needed. CONCLUSION: All-oral sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir combination shows high virological efficacy in liver transplant recipients and does not interact with immunosuppressants. All adverse events were unrelated to study drugs. These data strongly suggest that this combination must be initiated before decompensation.""",1

1247,25575044,The association between daytime napping and cognitive functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome,"The precise relationship between sleep and physical and mental functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has not been examined directly, nor has the impact of daytime napping. This study aimed to examine self-reported sleep in patients with CFS and explore whether sleep quality and daytime napping, specific patient characteristics (gender, illness length) and levels of anxiety and depression, predicted daytime fatigue severity, levels of daytime sleepiness and cognitive functioning, all key dimensions of the illness experience. 118 adults meeting the 1994 CDC case criteria for CFS completed a standardised sleep diary over 14 days. Momentary functional assessments of fatigue, sleepiness, cognition and mood were completed by patients as part of usual care. Levels of daytime functioning and disability were quantified using symptom assessment tools, measuring fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), cognitive functioning (Trail Making Test, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Hierarchical Regressions demonstrated that a shorter time since diagnosis, higher depression and longer wake time after sleep onset predicted 23.4% of the variance in fatigue severity (p <.001). Being male, higher depression and more afternoon naps predicted 25.6% of the variance in objective cognitive dysfunction (p <.001). Higher anxiety and depression and morning napping predicted 32.2% of the variance in subjective cognitive dysfunction (p <.001). When patients were classified into groups of mild and moderate sleepiness, those with longer daytime naps, those who mainly napped in the afternoon, and those with higher levels of anxiety, were more likely to be in the moderately sleepy group. Napping, particularly in the afternoon is associated with poorer cognitive functioning and more daytime sleepiness in CFS. These findings have clinical implications for symptom management strategies.

1248,11071104,Interferon beta-1b treatment in patients with relapsing--remitting multiple sclerosis under a standardized protocol in Spain,"""OBJECTIVE: A protocol system is being used in Spain for the prescription of innovative drugs including interferon beta-1b (IFNbeta-1b). Petitions for dispensing and reimbursement are based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of pivotal trials, and are reviewed individually for approval by specialist committees. To estimate the performance of IFNbeta-1b in the clinical setting, data collected by the INSALUD and regional health services of Andalusia and Catalonia, together responsible for the healthcare of nearly 30 million individuals, were compiled in a common database for analysis. METHODS: Data comprise demographic and disease characteristics at the time of petition and at follow-up 3 months after treatment initiation and every 6 months thereafter. Efficacy was estimated by mean number of relapses per year, proportion of relapse-free patients, and disease progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Safety parameters included adverse events and laboratory analyses. RESULTS: Between September 1995 and database cutoff in mid-1998, petitions of 1419 patients were approved for IFNbeta-1b treatment. Patients were homogenous across the three databases and in the subgroups of patients completing 1 year (n = 940) and 2 years (n = 302) of treatment. There was a marked decrease in the mean number of relapses in the first 12 months of IFNbeta-1b treatment for the 938 patients documented for 12 months, with a mean of 0.4 (+/- 0.7 SD) relapses per patient and year, and a 2-year mean of 0.9 (+/- 1.20 SD) in the 302 patients documented for 24 months. Of the 938 patients followed for > or = 12 months, 505 (53.8%) were documented as being relapse-free during 12 months of treatment, and 146 (48.3%) of the 302 patients followed for > or = 24 months, were relapse-free during 24 months of treatment. There were no differences in mean or median EDSS scores between baseline and months 12 and 24. Skin disorders were the most frequent adverse events, reported in over one-third of all patients; there were 159 injection site events, most frequently erythema (115 events). Systemic AEs pointing towards flu-like symptoms were reported in 288 of 1419 patients (20.3%). Leukopenia was the most frequently reported laboratory event. Elevations in liver transaminases were noted for 12 patients (0.8%) with SGOT increase and 7 (0.5%) with SGPT increase. CONCLUSION: The protocol system has helped make IFN treatment available to 8-10% of the estimated 15,000-18,000 MS patients in the regions studied. In terms of efficacy, IFNbeta-1b performed in line with the pivotal study results. The safety profile of IFNbeta-1b was consistent with the published findings and the drug labelling, and no new side effects or increased incidence of known side effects was observed.""",1
1249,19292302,Tibial tubercle fragmentation: a clue to simultaneous patellar ligament avulsion in pediatric tibial tubercle fractures,"Simultaneous avulsions of the tibial tubercle and patellar ligament have been reported, but are rare. We present an 11-year-old boy who was initially diagnosed with a Type IIIA tibial tubercle avulsion fracture after falling off of his bicycle. Intraoperatively, following exposure and fixation of the tibial tubercle fragment, knee range of motion under live fluoroscopy revealed a stationary patella with no tension in the patellar ligament. The incision was extended and a distal avulsion of the patellar ligament from the tibial tubercle was identified, with a small flap of tibial tubercle periosteum remaining attached. Transosseous suture fixation of the avulsed periosteal flap was achieved with 2 No. 5 ethibond sutures placed through connecting drill holes. Postoperatively, the patient was placed in a long leg cast with the knee in extension for 6 weeks. The injury to healed and the patient returned to full activities, although he required 2 courses of physical therapy and 4.5 months to regain full range of motion. Preoperative diagnosis of simultaneous tibial tubercle fracture and patellar ligament avulsion can be difficult. Palpation of the patellar ligament for gaps may not be possible due to a large knee effusion. Most patients do not tolerate quadriceps testing on examination and do not have patella alta on radiographs. In retrospect, a clue to this diagnosis in our patient was the preoperative radiographic finding of multiple calcified fragments below the patella. The calcified fragments likely represent the avulsed tibial tubercle periosteum attached to the distal patellar ligament. In addition, the large tibial tubercle fragment is separated and rotated superiorly, a finding that was also noted in two other similar case reports. ",0
1250,17326153,Dysfunction and functional restoration of HCV-specific CD8 responses in chronic hepatitis C virus infection,"The functional impairment of HCV-specific T cell responses is believed to be an important determinant of HCV persistence, but the functional T cell defects of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) are only partially defined. CD8 responses to HLA-A2-restricted epitopes of HCV and other unrelated viruses were studied in 23 HLA-A2-positive patients both ex vivo and after in vitro culture. Degranulation capacity, intracellular perforin, and granzyme-A content and cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) by HCV- and non-HCV-specific CD8 cells were tested both ex vivo and in vitro, whereas cytolytic activity was studied after 10 days' expansion in vitro. Memory maturation and role of exhaustion were assessed ex vivo by HCV-specific CD8 staining for CD127 and PD-1, and in vitro after peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture in the presence of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. IFN-gamma production and cytolytic activity were expressed less efficiently by HCV-specific than by non-HCV specific CD8 cells derived from the same CH-C patients. The amount of stored granzyme-A within single cells was always lower in HCV-specific CD8 cells, which were less efficient also in the release of lytic granules and in the production of TNF-alpha. The CD8 dysfunction was associated with high PD-1 expression by most HCV-specific CD8 cells, and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade by anti-PD-L1 antibodies in vitro was able to improve the HCV-specific CD8 function. CONCLUSION: Our study characterizes CD8 defects that may be important in maintaining HCV persistence; identification of strategies to correct these defects may help to define novel approaches to treat HCV infection.",0

We conducted double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept clinical study of IBHB capsules (300 mg, twice daily) with matching placebo for 6 months of period in 50 patients of PD stabilized on L-Dopa therapy. The efficacy outcome measures were the scores of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS - total and its subsections), and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging at baseline and end of 6-months treatment duration. Safety evaluation included haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis parameters and adverse event monitoring. Total UPDRS scores in IBHB treatment (0.098%) showed slower rise as opposed to steep rise (13.36%) shown by placebo. Further, Clinically Important Difference for total UPDRS scores and scores of motor subsection of UPDRS was found to be 5.3 and 4.8, respectively, in favour of IBHB treatment. Similar improvement was shown by IBHB in terms of H&Y staging as compared with placebo. IBHB was found to have excellent safety and tolerability profile.

1257,19003881,"Ethanol and arachidonic acid synergize to activate Kupffer cells and modulate the fibrogenic response via tumor necrosis factor alpha, reduced glutathione, and transforming growth factor beta-dependent mechanisms","""Because of the contribution of ethanol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to alcoholic liver disease, we investigated whether chronic ethanol administration and arachidonic acid (AA) could synergistically mediate Kupffer cell (KC) activation and modulate the stellate cell (HSC) fibrogenic response. RESULTS: (1) the effects of ethanol and AA on KC and HSC were as follows: Cell proliferation, lipid peroxidation, H(2)O(2), O(2).(-), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase activity, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were higher in KC(ethanol) than in KC(control), and were enhanced by AA; HSC(ethanol) proliferated faster, increased collagen, and showed higher GSH than HSC(control), with modest effects by AA. (2) AA effects on the control co-culture: We previously reported the ability of KC to induce a pro-fibrogenic response in HSC via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms; we now show that AA further increases cell proliferation and collagen in the control co-culture. The latter was prevented by vitamin E (an antioxidant) and by diphenyleneiodonium (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor). (3) Ethanol effects on the co-cultures: Co-culture with KC(control) or KC(ethanol) induced HSC(control) and HSC(ethanol) proliferation; however, the pro-fibrogenic response in HSC(ethanol) was suppressed because of up-regulation of TNF-alpha and GSH, which was prevented by a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody (Ab) and by L-buthionine-sulfoximine, a GSH-depleting agent. (4) Ethanol plus AA effects on the co-cultures: AA lowered TNF-alpha in the HSC(control) co-cultures, allowing for enhanced collagen deposition; furthermore, AA restored the pro-fibrogenic response in the HSC(ethanol) co-cultures by counteracting the up-regulation of TNF-alpha and GSH with a significant increase in GSSG and in pro-fibrogenic transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). CONCLUSION: These results unveil synergism between ethanol and AA to the mechanism whereby KC mediate ECM remodeling and suggest that even if chronic ethanol consumption sensitizes HSC to up-regulate anti-fibrogenic signals, their effects are blunted by a second """"hit"""" such as AA.""",0

1259,26970079,Hedgehog regulates yes-associated protein 1 in regenerating mouse liver,"Adult liver regeneration requires induction and suppression of proliferative activity in multiple types of liver cells. The mechanisms that orchestrate the global changes in gene expression that are required for proliferative activity to change within individual liver cells, and that coordinate proliferative activity among different types of liver cells, are not well understood. Morphogenic signaling pathways that are active during fetal development, including Hedgehog and Hippo/Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1), regulate liver regeneration in adulthood. Cirrhosis and liver cancer result when these pathways become dysregulated, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate and control morphogenic signaling during effective liver regeneration. We evaluated the hypothesis that the Hedgehog pathway controls Yap1 activation during liver regeneration by studying intact mice and cultured liver cells. In cultured hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), disrupting Hedgehog signaling blocked activation of Yap1, and knocking down Yap1 inhibited induction of both Yap1- and Hedgehog-regulated genes that enable HSC to become myofibroblasts (MFs). In mice, disrupting Hedgehog signaling in MFs inhibited liver regeneration after partial hepactectomy (PH). Reduced proliferative activity in the liver epithelial compartment resulted from loss of stroma-derived paracrine signals that activate Yap1 and the Hedgehog pathway in hepatocytes. This prevented hepatocytes from up-regulating Yap1- and Hedgehog-regulated transcription factors that normally promote their proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Morphogenic signaling in HSCs is necessary to reprogram hepatocytes to regenerate the liver epithelial compartment post-PH. This discovery identifies novel molecules that might be targeted to correct defective repair during cirrhosis and liver cancer. (Hepatology 2016;64:232-244).",0

To determine the incidence of thromboembolic events, bleeding complications such as epidural hematomas, and wound complications in patients with spinal trauma requiring surgical stabilization. Literature addressing the safety and efficacy of chemoprophylactic agents in postoperative patients with spinal trauma is sparse. As a result, significant variability exists regarding administration of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis in this population. The risk of bleeding complications is particularly concerning. Patients with spinal trauma who underwent surgical stabilization in 2009 and 2010 at a single level 1 trauma center were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria included patients who underwent solely decompressive procedures, noninstrumented fusions, kyphoplasty, or had incomplete medical records. Patients who received chemoprophylaxis were compared with patients who did not. Demographical information and injury data were collected. Primary outcome measures were prevalence of thromboembolic events, epidural hematomas, and persistent wound drainage requiring irrigation and debridement. Two hundred twenty-seven of 373 patients were included (56 in the untreated group, 171 in the treated group). Eight patients in the untreated group (14.3%) and 12 patients in the treated group (7%) developed postoperative thromboembolism (P = 0.096). There was 1 pulmonary embolism in the untreated group (1.8%), and 4 pulmonary embolisms in the treated group (2.3%). Surgical irrigation and debridement for wound drainage was required for 1.8% of patients in the untreated group and for 5.3% of patients in the treated group. No epidural hematomas were noted in either group. The treated group had more spinal levels fused (P = 0.46), higher injury severity scores (0.001), and longer hospitalizations (0.018). Patients who developed postoperative thromboembolism had significantly higher body mass indexes (P = 0.01), injury severity scores (0.001), number of spinal levels fused (P = 0.004), incidence of neurological deficits (0.001), and longer hospitalizations (0.16) compared with those who did not. The use of chemoprophylaxis appears to be safe in at-risk patients in the immediate postoperative period after spinal trauma surgery. No epidural hematomas occurred, and the risk of wound drainage is small. Body mass index, injury severity score, presence of neurological deficits, and number of spinal levels fused should be considered when determining which patients should receive chemoprophylaxis after surgical stabilization.

1263,22224084,Hepatic failure related to itraconazole use successfully treated by corticosteroids,"BACKGROUND: Itraconazole is believed to carry a low risk of hepatic toxicity owing to its low affinity for the human P-450 enzyme. Therefore, hepatic failure caused by itraconazole is exceedingly rare. OBJECTIVES: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who developed hepatic failure related to itraconazole that was administered for the treatment of onychomycosis. Her condition deteriorated after withdrawal of the drug, followed solely by supportive care initially. CASE REPORT: Treatment with corticosteroids was started 10 days after her admission, and her condition gradually improved. Unfortunately, her condition worsened when the dosage of corticosteroids was abruptly decreased. Ultimately, her condition improved with appropriate adjustments of corticosteroid dosage. DISCUSSION: We conclude that corticosteroid therapy may be effective for itraconazole-induced hepatitis, especially in those patients who do not respond to conservative treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human anti-interleukin-17 receptor antibody, in treating patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: In this phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01708590; AMAGINE-1), adult patients in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe were randomized to brodalumab (140 or 210�mg) or placebo every 2�weeks (Q2W), with an additional dose at week 1, for a 12-week induction phase. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab who achieved static Physician's Global Assessment 0 or 1 (sPGA success) were rerandomized to the placebo or induction dose. After week 16, patients with sPGA�?�3 were re-treated with the induction dose. After ?�12�weeks of retreatment, patients with sPGA 2 for ?�4�weeks or sPGA ?�3 were rescued with brodalumab 210�mg Q2W. At week 12, patients randomized to brodalumab with sPGA ?�2 or placebo received brodalumab 210�mg Q2W. Coprimary end points were the percentage of patients with ?�75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and sPGA success at week 12. RESULTS: There were 661 patients randomized: 220 placebo, 219 brodalumab 140�mg and 222 brodalumab 210�mg. At week 12, 60% (140�mg) and 83% (210�mg) vs. 3% (placebo) achieved PASI 75, and 54% (140�mg) and 76% (210�mg) vs. 1% (placebo) achieved sPGA success. The safety profile was considered acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab therapy resulted in significant clinical benefit and an acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.""",1
1265,1617696,Morphological differentiation of endothelial cells co-cultured with astrocytes on type-I or type-IV collagen,"In this study bovine aortic endothelial cells were co-cultured with astrocytes from fetal Wistar Kyoto rats. Endothelial cells growing on type-I collagen, co-cultured with astrocytes, showed various stages of development. Although some cells appeared to be mature, horseradish peroxidase penetrated within 1 min of incubation through the intercellular junctions of these endothelial elements maintained on type-I collagen. In contrast, endothelial cells on type-IV collagen, co-cultured with astrocytes, were well developed; their intercellular junctions were well established, and plasmalemmal vesicles reduced in number. As a result, horseradish peroxidase was unable to penetrate through the endothelial cells grown on type-IV collagen and co-cultured with astrocytes because of the reduced extent of the junctional and vesicular transport. These findings reveal that (1) type-IV collagen is essential for the differentiation of endothelial cells, (2) endothelial cell-astrocyte interactions occur during co-culture, and (3) endothelial permeability depends on astrocyte-produced factors, in addition to type-IV collagen.

1266,2695643,Premature gonadal failure in female dogs and cats,"Premature gonadal failure has been detected in phenotypically female dogs and cats with defective prenatal germ cell migration (ovarian aplasia), defective prenatal differentiation of the gonadal ridge into ovarian tissue (true hermaphroditism, male pseudohermaphroditism, ovarian dysgenesis in the presence of XO or XXX sex chromosome complements) or defective gamete maturation in the presence of primordial ovarian follicles (lymphocytic oophoritis, thyroid insufficiency). The most common of these is defective gonadal differentiation in animals with true hermaphroditism and failure of gamete maturation in thyroid insufficiency. A common clinical sign of premature gonadal failure in companion animals is failure to show a pubertal oestrus by 2 years of age. Diagnostic evaluation of such animals should include determination of the karyotype, plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and of thyroid hormones, gonadal histology, and gross evaluation of the Müllerian duct system at laparotomy.

Their effectiveness in preventing varices is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned 213 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (minimal hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] of 6 mm Hg) to receive timolol, a nonselective beta-blocker (108 patients), or placebo (105 patients). The primary end point was the development of gastroesophageal varices or variceal hemorrhage. Endoscopy and HVPG measurements were repeated yearly. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 54.9 months, the rate of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the timolol group and the placebo group (39 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P=0.89), nor were there significant differences in the rates of ascites, encephalopathy, liver transplantation, or death. Serious adverse events were more common among patients in the timolol group than among those in the placebo group (18 percent vs. 6 percent, P=0.006). Varices developed less frequently among patients with a baseline HVPG of less than 10 mm Hg and among those in whom the HVPG decreased by more than 10 percent at one year and more frequently among those in whom the HVPG increased by more than 10 percent at one year. CONCLUSIONS: Nonselective beta-blockers are ineffective in preventing varices in unselected patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension and are associated with an increased number of adverse events.

1269,31394072,Contraception across the transmasculine spectrum,"The field of transgender health continues to expand rapidly, including research in the area of family planning. While much attention has been given to fertility preservation and the parenting intentions of transgender individuals, far less has been paid to pregnancy prevention and contraceptive needs of people along the transmasculine gender spectrum (transgender men and gender-nonbinary persons who were assigned female at birth). Existing research illustrates that many clinicians and transmasculine individuals falsely believe that there is no risk of pregnancy while amenorrheic. These studies also show inconsistent counseling practices provided to transmasculine persons surrounding contraception and pregnancy while falling short of providing robust clinical guidance for improvement. Clinicians report a lack of adequate training in transgender reproductive health, and consequently, many do not feel comfortable treating transgender patients. The aim of this publication is to consolidate the findings of these prior studies and build upon them to offer comprehensive clinical guidance for managing contraception in transmasculine patients. To do so, it reviews the physiologic effects of testosterone on the sex steroid axis and current understanding of why ovulation and pregnancy may still occur while amenorrheic. Gender-inclusive terminology and a suggested script for eliciting a gender-affirming sexual history are offered. Common concerns (such as the effects on gender dysphoria and gender affirmation) and side effects of available contraceptive methods are subsequently addressed and how these may have a unique impact on transmasculine persons as compared with cisgender women. Lastly, a model is provided for approaching contraceptive counseling in the transmasculine population to assist clinicians and patients in determining the need for and selection of the type of contraception. To center transmasculine voices, the development of this publication's guidelines have been led by reproductive care clinicians of transgender experience. ",0
1270,9851383,Trial of oral miltefosine for visceral leishmaniasis,"""BACKGROUND: There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar. METHODS: Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse. FINDINGS: 21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.""",1
1271,6694706,Homozygosity of chromosome 13 in retinoblastoma,"We studied the frequency of chromosome 13 homozygosity in tumor tissue obtained directly from eyes harboring retinoblastomas. The data indicate that approximately half of all retinoblastomas are homozygous for large portions of 13q, that the homozygosity occurs in vivo and not as an event secondary to culture of the tumor cells, that chromosome 13 homozygosity is not correlated with the degree of histopathologic differentiation of the tumor, and that the homozygosity occurs in both sporadic and hereditary retinoblastomas. The development of chromosome 13 homozygosity may represent a fundamental event in the oncogenesis of a considerable number of retinoblastomas. This finding may have implications for the genetic counseling of patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. It may also be important in understanding the mechanism of oncogenesis of other tumors, especially hereditary tumors.",0
1272,21844273,Effects of lipopolysaccharide on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and influx of leukocytes in the hen ovary,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ovarian cells was changed to recruit heterophils and T cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a gram-negative bacterial component. White Leghorn laying hens were intravenously injected with LPS or saline and their ovarian follicles and stroma were collected. Changes in the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCLi2 in the theca and granulosa layers and ovarian stroma were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, whereas proteins of IL-1β and IL-6 were also identified by Western blot analysis. Localization of heterophil-like cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was examined by general histology and immunohistochemistry. The expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCLi2 were significantly increased in the granulosa layer, theca layer, and stroma tissues by 3 to 6 h after LPS injection. Increase of IL-1β and IL-6 proteins in those tissues was also identified 12 h after LPS injection. The LPS stimulation resulted in the increased influx of heterophil-like cells and CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) cells, in the theca layers of follicles. Saline injection affected neither expression of examined proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines nor frequencies of immunocompetent cells. These results suggest that ovarian follicular cells and stromal cells have the ability to express proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and their expression is upregulated by LPS in association with the recruitment of heterophil-like cells and T cells. These responses may play roles in local host defense in ovarian follicles. ",0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four children received 103 courses of docetaxel administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 21 days. Doses ranged from 55 to 150 mg/m2, MTD was defined in heavily pretreated and less heavily pretreated (< or = 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, no prior bone marrow transplantation [BMT], and no radiation to the spine, skull, ribs, or pelvic bones) patients. RESULTS: Dose-related neutropenia was the primary dose-limiting toxicity. The MTD in the heavily pretreated patient group was 65 mg/m2, but the less heavily pretreated patients tolerated a significantly higher dose of docetaxel (maximum-tolerated dose, 125 mg/m2). Neutropenia and constitutional symptoms consisting of malaise, myalgias, and anorexia were the dose-limiting toxicities at 150 mg/m2 in the less heavily pretreated patients. Thrombocytopenia was not prominent, even in patients who experienced dose-limiting neutropenia. Common nonhematologic toxicities of docetaxel included skin rashes, mucositis, and mild elevations of serum transaminases. Neuropathy was uncommon. Peripheral edema and weight gain were observed in two of five patients who received more than three cycles of docetaxel. A complete response (CR) was observed in one patient with rhabdomyosarcoma, a partial response (PR) in one patient with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PPNET), and a minimal response (MR) in two patients with PPNET. Three of the four responding patients were treated at doses > or = 100 mg/m2. CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose of docetaxel administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in children with solid tumors in 125 mg/m2. Because neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity and thrombocytopenia was mild, further escalation of the dose should be attempted with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.",1
1275,9878845,"The Gas1 glycoprotein, a putative wall polymer cross-linker","The yeast cell wall, which for years has been regarded as a static cellular component, has been revealed to be dynamic in its structure and composition and complex in its enzymatic activity. The S. cerevisiae cell wall is composed of beta-1,3/beta-1,6-glucans, mannoproteins, and chitin, which are assembled into an extracellular matrix essential for maintenance of cell integrity. Gas1p, a glycoprotein anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol, plays a key role in cell wall assembly. Loss of Gas1p leads to several morphogenetic defects and to a decrease in the amount of cross-links between the cell wall glucans. These defects in turn trigger a compensatory response that guarantees cell viability. Several Gas1p homologs have been isolated from Candida species and S. pombe. The Gas1p family also includes two plant proteins with endo-beta-1,3-glucanase activity. Sequence comparisons reveal that Gas1p family proteins have a modular organization of domains. The genetic and molecular analyses reviewed here suggest that Gas1p could play a role as a polymer cross-linker, presumably by catalyzing a transglycosylation reaction. ",0
1276,15044664,Binge status and quality of life after gastric bypass surgery: a one-year study,"This study evaluated gastric bypass surgery outcomes according to presurgical binge eating severity. Adult patients completed assessment questionnaires including the Short Form-36, Gormally Binge Eating Scale (BES), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before and 12 months after surgery. One hundred nine patients (18 men, 91 women) were recruited. Based on their baseline BES scores, patients were non- [n = 52 (48%)], moderate [n = 31 (28%)], or severe [n = 26 (24%)] binge eaters. Although the percentage of excess weight loss was greatest after 12 months in the severe binge eaters, the difference among groups was not significant. Severe binge eaters had higher baseline BDI scores than either non- or moderate binge eaters (p = 0.001). After surgery, BDI scores declined significantly in all groups from the baseline scores but remained higher postoperatively in the severe binge eaters (p = 0.018). BES scores declined significantly (p = 0.000) after surgery within all groups. There was no difference in the Short Form-36 physical component summary scores at baseline among groups. Mental component summary scores were significantly lower in the severe binge eaters (p = 0.001). After surgery, there was no difference among groups in either physical or mental component summary scores. In conclusion, data from the present study suggest that patients have similar outcomes in terms of improved depression scores, binge eating behavior, and health-related quality of life regardless of their binge eating severity before surgery. Patients with the most severe binge eating behavior before surgery showed the most improvement when assessed 12 months after surgery. ",0

1278,8138271,"Hepatocyte growth factor in transgenic mice: effects on hepatocyte growth, liver regeneration and gene expression","Attention has recently been focused on hepatocyte growth factor as a major candidate factor in liver regeneration because it is the most potent known mitogen for hepatocytes in vitro. However, hepatocyte growth factor also displays diverse activities in vitro as scatter factor, as an epithelial morphogen, as a pluripotent mitogen and as a growth inhibitor. Consequently, we developed transgenic mice that expressed hepatocyte growth factor under the control of albumin regulatory sequences to examine its in vivo role in hepatocyte growth. Hepatocytes of these mice expressed increased levels of hepatocyte growth factor as an autocrine growth factor. Hepatocyte growth factor was a potent stimulus for liver repair; the livers of hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic mice recovered completely in half the time needed for their normal siblings after partial hepatectomy. This transgenic model also enabled us to study the chronic effects of hepatocyte growth factor expression. During several months of observation, the labeling index of hepatocytes in albumin-hepatocyte growth factor mice was doubled, and liver DNA content was increased compared with that in wild-type mice. To identify intermediate signaling pathways for hepatocyte growth factor that might regulate this increased growth response, we examined transgenic mice for changes in expression of genes that are known to be regulated during liver regeneration. We found that levels of c-myc and c-jun mRNA were increased in the hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic mice. In additional experiments the increased c-myc expression was the consequence of increased transcription rates as seen in nuclear run-on and myc-CAT reporter gene experiments. We conclude that hepatocyte growth factor increases growth and repair processes when expressed for long periods in the liver and that c-myc and c-jun may be important intermediaries in the hepatocyte growth response caused by hepatocyte growth factor.",0

Stereotyped complex behaviours are present in a number of psychotic illnesses, neurological diseases and even can be generated in response to chemical environment (e.g., drugs or toxins). 2. The circadian rhythm of complex behaviours such as, rearing, preening, scratching and biting/licking was evaluated in an open-field situation in rats exposed to lead (2% lead acetate in drinking water for 30 days). 3. The circadian rhythm of rearing patterns showed depressions from 2 to 14 hr on day 3 and 13, and from 2-6 hr on day 23 (it elevated at 10 hr), whereas increased pattern was apparent at all test periods (except at 6 hr) on day 30. 4. Increased responses of circadian rhythm of preening behaviour were obtained at 18 hr (with decrease at 22 hr) on day 3, at 6 and 14-22 hr on day 13 and, at all the test periods on day 23 (except at 6 hr) and on day 30. 5. The rhythmic patterns of the scratching behaviour showed elevations at each test period as observed on day 3, 13, 23 and 30. The responses in lead-intoxicated rates, however, showed depressions in the light-period and augmentations in the dark-period. 6. The biting/licking behaviours indicated increased patterns of the circadian rhythm attaining a parabolic response, which were inconsistent to the scratching behaviour patterns. Amongst lead-intoxicated rats this behaviour exhibited depressed responses in light-period, whereas in dark-period it showed elevations. ",0

Cross-sectional survey study of patients who had survived one year or more after a stroke. Subjects consisted of stroke patients attending the outpatient clinic of a rehabilitation centre. HRQOL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), functional status using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and mood using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). A total of 100 patients (63 men and 37 women, mean age 60.7 +/-10.8 years) were interviewed at an average of 22.2 +/-14.5 months post-stroke. The mean MBI was 88.9 +/-17.9, and the prevalence of depression 24%. 50 percent of patients needed varying degrees of care for their activities of daily living. The SF-36 scores of the patients were comparable to that of the general population except for the domain of physical function, which was much lower (23.9 versus 83.4). Age, sex, post-stroke duration, MBI score and side of hemiplegia were not associated with HRQOL. Depressed patients however had significantly lower SF-36 scores across all domains except for that of physical function and bodily pain (p-value is less than 0.001). A significant proportion of chronic stroke survivors attending the rehabilitation clinic continue to face limitations in their physical activities. In addition, almost 30 percent of these survivors have depression that affects their HRQOL adversely. ",0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective hospital-based study was carried out over a period of 3 years (June 2007 to September 2009) at Sheth Vadilal Hospital, Ahmedabad, India. The diagnosis of SJS was made mainly on the basis of the clinical findings, which included extensive erythema multiforme, purpuric lesions with bullae and detachment of skin involving at least two mucous membranes. Further, in each patient suspected with SJS, various laboratory tests such as complete blood count, liver function tests, metabolic panel, chest X-ray and other serological test were carried out. SJS was confirmed on the basis of most widely accepted Bastuji-Garin definition. Causality assessment was performed using the Naranjo scale. Only 'probable' and 'definite' reactions were included. RESULTS: Antibacterials for systemic use, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products and antiepileptics were the drug classes most commonly associated (8 of 29 cases, each) with SJS. Individually, ibuprofen was involved in the highest number of cases (five cases, 17.2%), followed by carbamazepine (four cases, 13.8%) . The mean duration of developing SJS symptoms was 15.9 days (SD = 8.7 days) and improvement after treatment was 14.2 days (SD = 4.6 days). The duration of appearing SJS symptoms varied significantly between different classes of drugs (p < 0.001). The appearance of SJS symptom started within 10 days for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compared with 24 days of antiepileptic agents. All the patients with antiepileptic agent-induced SJS had 7% to 9% of detached body surface area. In two patients, SJS progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis and of which one led to death and the other developed long-term complication of conjunctival xerosis. A total of six patients developed long-term complications: four patients had conjunctival synechia, one patient had conjunctival xerosis and one patient had urethral stricture. CONCLUSION: More than 80% of the SJS events were induced by antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiepileptic agents with same frequency. The duration of the appearance of SJS symptoms significantly varied between different drug classes and started within 10 days for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compared with 24 days of antiepileptic agents.",1

1286,9855171,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated toxicity of the liver, lower gastrointestinal tract, and esophagus","Although upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events are the most common consequences of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, there are other GI side effects that can contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs. NSAID-associated toxicity of the large and small bowel is increasingly recognized in clinical practice, as enteroscopic procedures become more frequently used. This lower GI toxicity may have several different manifestations: ulcerations, strictures, colitis, or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic injury, most likely due to an idiosyncratic reaction resulting from an immunologic response or altered metabolic pathways, is another sequela of NSAID use that is usually reversible. Although hepatotoxicity is listed as a class warning for NSAIDs, aspirin, diclofenac, and sulindac are most commonly associated with this problem. Surveillance for hepatic injury is not always reliable, and the low frequency of both hepatic and lower GI toxicity in NSAID users renders these events difficult to characterize. An increase in awareness, surveillance, and reporting of these events can lead to a better understanding of the risk factors and etiology associated with NSAID toxicity.",1
1287,12801963,Impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the progression of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus infected patients,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV coinfected patients, and to identify factors that may influence fibrosis progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 153 HCV infected and 55 HCV-HIV coinfected patients were identified from two London hospitals. Eligible patients had known dates of HCV acquisition, were HCV-RNA positive, and had undergone a liver biopsy, which was graded using the Ishak score. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with fibrosis progression rate and the development of advanced fibrosis (stages 3 and 4). RESULTS: The estimated median fibrosis progression rate was 0.17 units/year (interquartile range (IQR) 0.10-0.25) in HIV-HCV coinfected and 0.13 (IQR 0.07-0.17) in HCV monoinfected patients (p=0.01), equating to an estimated time from HCV infection to cirrhosis of 23 and 32 years, respectively. Older age at infection (p<0.001), HIV positivity (p=0.019), higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (p=0.039), and higher inflammatory activity (p<0.001) on first biopsy were all independently associated with more rapid fibrosis progression. ALT was correlated with histological index (r=0.35, p<0.001). A CD4 cell count < or =250 x 10(6)/l was independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis (odds ratio 5.36 (95% confidence interval 1.26-22.79)) and was also correlated with a higher histological index (r=-0.42, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: HIV infection modifies the natural history of HCV by accelerating the rate of fibrosis progression by 1.4 fold, and the development of advanced fibrosis threefold. A low CD4 cell count was independently associated with advanced disease and correlated with higher histological index, which suggests that early antiretroviral therapy may be of benefit in slowing HCV progression in coinfected patients.",1
1288,25575473,Formulation and process optimization of multiparticulate pulsatile system delivered by osmotic pressure-activated rupturable membrane,"In this study, a multiparticulate pulsatile drug delivery system activated by a rupturable controlled-release membrane (Eudragit(®) RS) via osmotic pressure (with NaCl as the osmogent) was developed and characterized for omeprazole, omeprazole sodium, and propranolol HCl which have different water solubilities. Multiparticulates in pellet form for incorporation with or without the osmogent were manufactured by three methods and then used to coat a polymeric membrane. Results demonstrated that drug/osmogent-containing pellets manufactured by the extrusion/spheronization method with incorporation of the osmogent were optimal. The lag time (tL) to initiate pulsatile release is regulated by tL=l(2)/(6×D), which is dependent on the coating levels (l(2)) and plasticizer content (D). The pulsatile release pattern was found to be dependent on the osmotic pressure (osmogent), drug solubility, and mechanical properties of the polymeric membrane (elasticity and toughness). Omeprazole with lower water solubility could not generate sufficient osmotic pressure to create a crack in the membrane to activate pulsatile release, whereas the two other model drugs with higher solubilities could. But adsorption of omeprazole sodium on Eudragit(®) RS via charge-charge interactions led the its incomplete release. Finally, with 4% osmogent of NaCl added, a lag time in a range from 0 to 12h proportionally regulated by varying both the membrane thickness and plasticizer level initiated the complete pulsatile release of propranolol HCl. In conclusion, a multiparticulate pulsatile drug delivery system activated by a rupturable controlled-release membrane via osmotic pressure was successfully developed, and clinical applications of chronotherapy with drugs like propranolol HCl are expected.

1289,19582432,Maintaining and engineering neural stem cells for delivery of genetically encoded therapy to brain tumors,"Despite advances for the treatment of cancer, the prognosis for patients suffering from malignant brain tumors remains dismal. High-grade neoplasms, such as gliomas, are highly invasive and spawn widely disseminated microsatellites that have limited the efficacy of surgical and adjunctive therapies. The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that conventional chemotherapeutic treatments kill differentiated and differentiating cells which often form the bulk of the tumor. One major concern is that the cells which give rise to the tumor, the cancer stem cells, remain untouched and may be responsible for a relapse of the disease. Therefore, an adjunctive therapy to current cancer treatment is critical for the survivability of patients suffering from brain tumors. We have successfully engineered tumor-tropic neural stem cells to deliver antineoplastic gene products directly to the tumor-producing cells. This potential therapeutic strategy may safely eradicate tumor-producing cells in the brain while minimizing damage to normal, healthy cells. ",0

Two high-dose regimens, FPV 1,400 mg twice a day (BID) plus RTV 100 mg BID and FPV 1,400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID, were planned to be compared to the approved regimen, FPV 700 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID, in a randomized three-period crossover study. Forty-two healthy adult subjects were enrolled, and 39 subjects completed period 1. Due to marked hepatic transaminase elevations, predominantly with FPV 1,400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID, the study was terminated prematurely. For FPV 1,400 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID, the values for plasma amprenavir (APV) area under the concentration-time profile over the dosing interval (tau) at steady state [AUC(0-tau)], maximum concentration of drug in plasma (C(max)), and plasma concentration at the end of tau at steady state (C(tau)) were 54, 81, and 26% higher, respectively, and the values for plasma RTV AUC(0-tau), C(max), and C(tau) were 49% higher, 71% higher, and 11% lower, respectively, than those for FPV 700 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID. For FPV 1,400 mg BID plus RTV 200 mg BID, the values for plasma APV AUC(0-tau), C(max), and C(tau) were 26, 48, and 32% higher, respectively, and the values for plasma RTV AUC(0-tau), C(max), and C(tau) increased 4.15-fold, 4.17-fold, and 3.99-fold, respectively, compared to those for FPV 700 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID.

1294,23822215,The effect of chronic prenatal hypoxia on the development of mature neurons in the cerebellum,"Adverse intrauterine circumstances can result in abnormal brain development, and can contribute to many neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy and cognitive and behavioral deficits. These neurological problems are caused by conditions that cause chronic placental insufficiency (CPI), such as hypoxia and acidemia. Hypoxia has been implicated in structural alterations of the cerebellum during development; however, the changes to the cerebellar external granular layer (EGL) induced by chronic prenatal hypoxia are not well understood. We therefore investigated the effect of chronic prenatal hypoxia on the development of mature neurons in the EGL using the guinea pig CPI model. Unilateral uterine artery ligation was performed at 30 to 32 days of gestation (dg) - with term defined as approximately 67 dg. At 50 dg, 60 dg, and one week after birth, fetuses and newborns were sacrificed and assigned to either the growth-restricted (GR) or control (no ligation) group. After fixation, dissection, and sectioning of cerebellar tissue from these animals, immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies raised to hypoxia-induced factor 1α (Hif1α), Pax6, NeuroD, and NeuN. The induction of hypoxia was confirmed by the presence of Hif1α immunoreactivity in the EGL of the GR (but not control) fetuses. The only other cellular immunoreactivity found in any of the tissues was to the NeuN antibody, which is a marker of mature neurons. The proportion of NeuN-immunoreactive (NeuN-IR) cells to the total number of cells in the EGL did not differ between the GR and control groups at 50 and 60 dg. The density of NeuN-IR cells was greater in GR fetuses than in controls at 60 dg (P < 0.05) but not at 50 dg. At one week after birth, the EGL was just one cell thick, and only a few NeuN-IR cells could be observed in both groups. TUNEL assays performed to enable the evaluation of apoptosis in the cerebellar EGL revealed that cell death was not affected by hypoxia at 50 dg, 60 dg, and one week after birth. These findings indicate that chronic prenatal hypoxia affects the process of neuronal production late in fetal life, but that this effect does not persist postnatally. ",0
1295,25569691,High throughput absorbance spectra of cancerous cells: a microscopic investigation of spectral artifacts,"""FTIR spectroscopy was recently demonstrated to be a useful tool to obtain a unique fingerprint of the effects of several anticancer drugs on cells in culture. While FTIR spectroscopy appears to have a definite potential to sort anticancer drugs on the basis of the metabolic modifications they induced, the present challenge is to evaluate the drug-induced spectral changes in cancer cells on a larger scale. The coupling of FTIR spectroscopy with a high throughput screening extension could become a useful method to generate drug classifications based on their """"modes of action"""". Practically, the robustness of this approach is jeopardized by the variability that can appear from one cell smear to the next. When a few cells are scattered on the support, strong scattering effects are observed and locally dense cell aggregates could result in non-linearity of the signal. A microscopic study using infrared imaging demonstrates that the mean HTS (96-well High Throughput Spectroscopy) spectra recorded on 96 well ZnSe plates are the averages of contributions characterized by a wide absorbance distribution and by Mie scattering effects which significantly vary from point to point. Spectrum quality is at its best at the highest cell concentrations, i.e. from 300 000 to 400 000 cells per well, which present the best S/N and a relatively smaller Mie scattering effect. When the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was treated with four different polyphenols, spectra showed quite similar variations with respect to control spectra, with more intense variations for the quercetin and EGCG compared to resveratrol and capsaicin. Correction of the spectra with the RMieS algorithm improved their clustering according to the polyphenolic treatment.  """,0

In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of orally administered sorafenib in the treatment of patients with this type of cancer. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (DECISION), we investigated sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that had progressed within the past 14 months. Adult patients (?18 years of age) with this type of cancer were enrolled from 77 centres in 18 countries. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have at least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2; adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration lower than 0?5 mIU/L. An interactive voice response system was used to randomly allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio to either sorafenib or matching placebo. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed every 8 weeks by central independent review. Analysis was by intention to treat. Patients in the placebo group could cross over to open-label sorafenib upon disease progression. Archival tumour tissue was examined for BRAF and RAS mutations, and serum thyroglobulin was measured at baseline and at each visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00984282, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number EudraCT 2009-012007-25. FINDINGS: Patients were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to sorafenib or placebo. The intention-to-treat population comprised 417 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 210 in the placebo group) and the safety population was 416 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 209 in the placebo group). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (10?8 months) than in the placebo group (5?8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0?59, 95% CI 0?45-0?76; p<0?0001). Progression-free survival improved in all prespecified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, irrespective of mutation status. Adverse events occurred in 204 of 207 (98?6%) patients receiving sorafenib during the double-blind period and in 183 of 209 (87?6%) patients receiving placebo. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in the sorafenib group were hand-foot skin reaction (76?3%), diarrhoea (68?6%), alopecia (67?1%), and rash or desquamation (50?2%). INTERPRETATION: Sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sorafenib. These results suggest that sorafenib is a new treatment option for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

1299,23298605,Lacosamide in pediatric and adult patients: comparison of efficacy and safety,"""PURPOSE: This multicenter, prospective study investigates the efficacy and safety of lacosamide adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. METHOD: This study was carried out between September 2010 and December 2011 at 16 Italian and 1 German neurologic centers. Lacosamide was added to the baseline therapy at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day in patients aged <16 years (group A) and 100 mg daily in subjects aged 16 and older (group B), and titrated to the target dose, ranging from 3 to 12 mg/kg/day or from 100 to 600 mg daily, respectively. After completing the titration period, patients entered a 12-month maintenance period and they were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary assessment of efficacy was based on the change from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 days and was evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months as follows: number and proportion of 100% responders, 50% responders, non-responders and worsening patients. Safety evaluation was also performed at 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (59 group A, 59 group B) with uncontrolled generalized and focal epilepsy were enrolled. Patient mean?SD age was 15.9?6.80 years and the age range was 4-38 years. At 3-month evaluation, of 118 treated patients 56 subjects (47.4% group A; 47.4% group B; p=0.8537) experienced at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 6 and 12-month follow-up, the 50% responders were 57 (52.5% group A; 44.1% group B; p=0.4612) and 51 (47.4% group A; 39% group B; p=0.4573), respectively. Thirty-five subjects (30.5% group A; 28.8% group B; p=1) experienced side effects during the treatment period. The most common adverse events were dyspepsia for group A and dizziness for group B.

1300,21879900,Electronic health records and quality of diabetes care,"BACKGROUND: Available studies have shown few quality-related advantages of electronic health records (EHRs) over traditional paper records. We compared achievement of and improvement in quality standards for diabetes at practices using EHRs with those at practices using paper records. All practices, including many safety-net primary care practices, belonged to a regional quality collaborative and publicly reported performance. METHODS: We used generalized estimating equations to calculate the percentage-point difference between EHR-based and paper-based practices with respect to achievement of composite standards for diabetes care (including four component standards) and outcomes (five standards), after adjusting for covariates and accounting for clustering. In addition to insurance type (Medicare, commercial, Medicaid, or uninsured), patient-level covariates included race or ethnic group (white, black, Hispanic, or other), age, sex, estimated household income, and level of education. Analyses were conducted separately for the overall sample and for safety-net practices. RESULTS: From July 2009 through June 2010, data were reported for 27,207 adults with diabetes seen at 46 practices; safety-net practices accounted for 38% of patients. After adjustment for covariates, achievement of composite standards for diabetes care was 35.1 percentage points higher at EHR sites than at paper-based sites (P<0.001), and achievement of composite standards for outcomes was 15.2 percentage points higher (P=0.005). EHR sites were associated with higher achievement on eight of nine component standards. Such sites were also associated with greater improvement in care (a difference of 10.2 percentage points in annual improvement, P<0.001) and outcomes (a difference of 4.1 percentage points in annual improvement, P=0.02). Across all insurance types, EHR sites were associated with significantly higher achievement of care and outcome standards and greater improvement in diabetes care. Results confined to safety-net practices were similar. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the premise that federal policies encouraging the meaningful use of EHRs may improve the quality of care across insurance types.",0
1301,23231846,The safety of methimazole and propylthiouracil in pregnancy: a systematic review,"""BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in pregnant women, and it can severely complicate the course and outcome of pregnancy. Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the standard anti-thyroid drugs used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Traditionally, MMI has been considered to have clearer evidence of teratogenicity than PTU. Recent studies suggest that PTU can be hepatotoxic, leading to a United States Food and Drug Administration """"black box alert."""" We wished to systematically review the effects of PTU and MMI during pregnancy, and to compare maternal and fetal safety. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, TOXNET, TOXLINK, DART, Medscape, EBSCO, and Google. Both English and non-English publications were included. We excluded studies using anti-thyroid therapies other than PTU and MMI, studies not allowing interpretation of results, and abstracts of meetings. RESULTS: Overall, insufficient statistical power precluded determination of accurate rates of either MMI teratogenicity or PTU hepatotoxicity in cohort studies. However, a case-control study helped identify the relative risk of MMI-induced choanal atresia. A second case-control study failed to show that aplasia cutis congenita is associated with MMI. PTU has been associated with a rare but serious form of hepatic failure. CONCLUSION: MMI causes a specific pattern of rare teratogenic effects after first trimester exposure, while PTU therapy may be followed by rare but severe hepatotoxic sequelae. It is therefore appropriate to use PTU to treat maternal hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, and to switch to MMI for the remainder of the pregnancy.""",1

Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving ramucirumab. This approval was based on an improvement in overall survival (OS) with an acceptable toxicity profile in a randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 1,253 patients with metastatic NSCLC previously treated with a platinum-based combination therapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel or placebo in combination with docetaxel. The primary endpoint was OS. Patients who received ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel had improved OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.98). Median OS was 10.5 months on the ramucirumab plus docetaxel arm versus 9.1 months on the placebo plus docetaxel arm. The most frequent (>/= 30%) adverse reactions in ramucirumab-treated patients were fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea. The most frequent (>/= 5%) grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions in the ramucirumab arm were fatigue, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypertension. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This report presents key information on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, given in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

These ten paper substrates containing body fluids were kept at room temperature for varying lengths of time ranging from one day to approximately one year. For all assays in this research, 1.2 mm punches were collected from each substrate containing one type of body fluid and amplified with reagents provided in the nine commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification kits. The substrates were not subjected to purification reagent or extraction buffer prior to amplification. Success rates were calculated for all nine amplification kits and all ten substrates based on their ability to yield complete DNA profiles following a direct amplification protocol. Six out of the nine amplification kits, and four out of the ten paper substrates had the highest success rates overall. The data show that it is possible to generate complete DNA profiles following a direct amplification protocol using both standard (non-direct) and direct PCR amplification kits.

The efficacy of azathioprine (AZA), in the maintenance of remission of IBD has been suggested by several studies. However, AZA tends to exter varied well-known toxicity. Since the rate of hepato-pancreatic side-effects in patients with IBD and PSC is still unclear, we investigated this issue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive subjects who underwent Outpatient Clinic admission for both IBD and PSC were included. Both conditions were diagnosed according to International Guidelines. RESULTS: Data of 43 patients were elaborated. Twelve of them underwent therapy with AZA. Five (41.7%) presented hepatic (n=4) or pancreatic toxicity. Eighty percent of the patients with hepato-pancreatic reactions versus 28.6% of those without (p < 0.001) were males, with 60% affected by ulcerative colitis and 40% by Crohn's disease versus 57% and 43%, respectively. Forty percent of patients with reactions versus 43% of those without needed an operation for IBD, and the same percentage underwent orthotopic liver transplantation, with a 100% versus 66.7% (p < 0.001) need of second transplantation. Colonic neoplasia (20%) was detected only in the former group while cholangiocarcinoma (28.6%) only in the latter. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of hepato-pancreatic reactions from AZA in our caseload is higher (41.7%) compared to that reported in literature (4%). Therefore, the presence of PSC, in association to IBD, may strongly affect AZA tolerability compared to presence of IBD only. �",1

Two cases in which deep tendon reflexes were initially preserved in the presence of profound and persistent muscle weakness are presented here. In both cases, deep tendon reflexes were later severely attenuated or lost, while weakness of the involved muscles remained profound and unchanged. Both patients showed good motor recovery at 6 months. Initial preservation of deep tendon reflexes in the presence of persistent muscle weakness indicates that in the early stages of disease, the muscle weakness in these two cases was not caused by destruction of anterior horn cells. Pathology involving anterior horns preceding AHC destruction could potentially disrupt upper motor neuron pathways to anterior horn cells, causing weakness with initial preserved deep tendon reflexes.

However, there is controversy about whether more rapid treatment of sepsis improves outcomes in patients. METHODS: We studied data from patients with sepsis and septic shock that were reported to the New York State Department of Health from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients had a sepsis protocol initiated within 6 hours after arrival in the emergency department and had all items in a 3-hour bundle of care for patients with sepsis (i.e., blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents, and lactate measurement) completed within 12 hours. Multilevel models were used to assess the associations between the time until completion of the 3-hour bundle and risk-adjusted mortality. We also examined the times to the administration of antibiotics and to the completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluid. RESULTS: Among 49,331 patients at 149 hospitals, 40,696 (82.5%) had the 3-hour bundle completed within 3 hours. The median time to completion of the 3-hour bundle was 1.30 hours (interquartile range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the administration of antibiotics was 0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), and the median time to completion of the fluid bolus was 2.56 hours (interquartile range, 1.33 to 4.20). Among patients who had the 3-hour bundle completed within 12 hours, a longer time to the completion of the bundle was associated with higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; P<0.001), as was a longer time to the administration of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06; P<0.001) but not a longer time to the completion of a bolus of intravenous fluids (odds ratio, 1.01 per hour; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02; P=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: More rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and rapid administration of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluids, were associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality.

In addition, 3 patients had strictures and 2 patients had perianal fistulas. After the three infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight), internal fistulas remained unchanged in all patients. The perianal fistulas present in 2 cases were healed. Administration of infliximab was safe and well tolerated in all cases. Treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight) led to healing of only the perianal fistulas, whereas the internal fistulas were not influenced. We conclude that in these 4 cases, infliximab was well tolerated but not effective for the management of internal fistulas and was no alternative for surgery. ",0
1312,26256408,17β-Estradiol in the systemic circulation derives mainly from the parietal cells in cholestatic female rats,"Estrogenic symptoms of liver disease patients including biliary tract disorder with high frequency is observed in clinical cases. However, the origin of 17β-estradiol which is abundant enough to cause symptoms remains uncertain. In male rats, it has been reported that the parietal cells which have an abundance of aromatase-synthesized 17β-estradiol, and a part of 17β-estradiol secreted into the portal vein, may flow into the systemic circulation under a pathophysiological condition of the liver including bile duct ligation (BDL). The aim of this study is to reveal the origin of 17β-estradiol increment in female rats and to investigate the effect of BDL on the ovary during the estrus cycle. Wistar female rats were used, and the common bile duct was ligated twice and transected completely at 7 days before termination. Serum portal venous and arterial 17β-estradiol levels, Cyp19a1 expressions, aromatase protein levels, and estrogen receptor (ER) α levels in the liver were measured during the estrus cycle. Both arterial and portal venous 17β-estradiol levels increased 2.9 times at proestrus and maintained constant levels during the cycle. The expression of Cyp19a1 and aromatase protein in the stomach maintained constant levels, and significantly decreased during the estrus cycle in the ovary. Hepatic ERα protein and Esr1 expressions decrease by BDL in all stages. These results suggest that the increment of serum 17β-estradiol levels in obstructive cholestasis induced by BDL is derived from 17β-estradiol secreted from the parietal cells in females as well as males.

1313,24066915,Evaluation of mRNA expression levels and electrophysiological function of neuron-like cells derived from canine bone marrow stromal cells,"To investigate the in vitro differentiation of canine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into functional, mature neurons. Bone marrow from 6 adult dogs. BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow and chemically induced to develop into neurons. The morphology of the BMSCs during neuronal induction was monitored, and immunocytochemical analyses for neuron markers were performed after the induction. Real-time PCR methods were used to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of markers for neural stem or progenitor cells, neurons, and ion channels, and western blotting was used to assess the expression of neuronal proteins before and after neuronal induction. The electrophysiological properties of the neuron-like cells induced from canine BMSCs were evaluated with fluorescent dye to monitor Ca(2)+ influx. Canine BMSCs developed a neuron-like morphology after neuronal induction. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that these neuron-like cells were positive for neuron markers. After induction, the cells' mRNA expression levels of almost all neuron and ion channel markers increased, and the protein expression levels of nestin and neurofilament-L increased significantly. However, the neuron-like cells derived from canine BMSCs did not have the Ca(2)+ influx characteristic of spiking neurons. Although canine BMSCs had neuron-like morphological and biochemical properties after induction, they did not develop the electrophysiological characteristics of neurons. Thus, these results have suggested that canine BMSCs could have the capacity to differentiate into a neuronal lineage, but the differentiation protocol used may have been insufficient to induce development into functional neurons.

1314,7898526,"The epidemiology of tuberculosis among foreign-born persons in the United States, 1986 to 1993","BACKGROUND: One third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and in the developed countries immigration is a major force that sustains the incidence of tuberculosis. We studied the effects of immigration on the epidemiology of tuberculosis and its recent resurgence in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed data from the national tuberculosis reporting system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1986 reports of tuberculosis have included the patient's country of origin. Population estimates for foreign-born persons were derived from special samples from the 1980 and 1990 censuses. RESULTS: The proportion of persons reported to have tuberculosis who were foreign-born increased from 21.6 percent (4925 cases) in 1986 to 29.6 percent (7346 cases) in 1993. For the entire eight-year period, most foreign-born patients with tuberculosis were from Latin America (43.9 percent; 21,115 cases) and Southeast Asia (34.6 percent; 16,643 cases). Among foreign-born persons the incidence rate was almost quadruple the rate for native residents of the United States (30.6 vs. 8.1 per 100,000 person-years), and 55 percent of immigrants with tuberculosis had the condition diagnosed in their first five years in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Immigration has had an increasingly important effect on the epidemiology of tuberculosis in the United States. It will be difficult to eliminate tuberculosis without better efforts to prevent and control it among immigrants and greater efforts to control it in the countries from which they come.",0
1315,25639506,Final quality of life and safety data for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cabazitaxel in the UK Early Access Programme (EAP) (NCT01254279),"OBJECTIVE: To compile the safety profile and quality of life (QoL) data for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cabazitaxel in the UK Early Access Programme (UK EAP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients participated at 12 UK cancer centres. All had mCRPC with disease progression during or after docetaxel. Patients received cabazitaxel 25 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks with prednisolone 10 mg daily for up to 10 cycles. Safety assessments were performed before each cycle and QoL was recorded at alternate cycles using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS). The safety profile was compiled after completion of the UK EAP and QoL measures were analysed to record trends. No formal statistical analysis was carried out. RESULTS: The incidences of neutropenic sepsis (6.3%), grade 3 and 4 diarrhoea (4.5%) and grade 3 and 4 cardiac toxicity (0%) were low. Neutropenic sepsis episodes, though low, occurred only in patients who did not receive prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. There were trends towards improved VAS and EQ-5D-3L pain scores during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The UK EAP experience indicates that cabazitaxel might improve QoL in mCRPC and represents an advance and a useful addition to the armamentarium of treatment for patients whose disease has progressed during or after docetaxel. In view of the potential toxicity, careful patient selection is important.",1
1316,24704719,Effectiveness of telaprevir or boceprevir in treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the effectiveness of the protease inhibitors peginterferon and ribavirin in treatment-experienced patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis. METHODS: In the Compassionate Use of Protease Inhibitors in Viral C Cirrhosis study, 511 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis who did not respond to a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin (44.3% relapsers or patients with viral breakthrough, 44.8% partial responders, and 8.0% null responders) were given either telaprevir (n�= 299) or boceprevir (n�= 212) for 48 weeks. We assessed percentages of patients with sustained viral responses 12 weeks after therapy and safety. This observational study did not allow for direct comparison of the 2 regimens. RESULTS: Among patients given telaprevir, 74.2% of relapsers, 40.0% of partial responders, and 19.4% of null responders achieved SVR12. Among those given boceprevir, 53.9% of relapsers, 38.3% of partial responders, and none of the null responders achieved SVR12. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with SVR12 included prior response to treatment response, no lead-in phase, HCV subtype 1b (vs 1a), and baseline platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3). Severe adverse events occurred in 49.9% of cases, including liver decompensation, severe infections in 10.4%, and death in 2.2%. In multivariate analysis, baseline serum albumin level less than 35 g/L and baseline platelet counts of 100,000/mm(3) or less predicted severe side effects or death. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high percentages of real-life, treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis respond to the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin with telaprevir or boceprevir. However, side effects are frequent and often severe. Baseline levels of albumin and platelet counts can be used to guide treatment decisions. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01514890.",1
1317,1525880,Retinal vein occlusion. III. Initial experience with therapy of retinal vein occlusion with an argon laser],"The authors report the results of laser treatment in 11 patients with chronic oedema of the macula and 6 patients with neovascularizations of the retina and disk of the optic nerve in occlusion of a branch of the retinal vein. In the treatment of chronic oedema of the macula they used their own modification of quadrant barrage suggested by L'Esperance and grid photocoagulation. After a mean follow up period of 3.2 years they achieved a resulting vision of 6/12 or better in 9 of 11 patients, i.e. in 82%, the poorest results were 6/18 in two patients of 11, i.e. in 18%. In the treatment of neovascularizations they used the method of sector photocoagulation. In all six patients, i.e. in 100% they observed regression of neovascularizations. During 2.5-3 years after photocoagulation they did not observe a relapse of neovascularization or haemorrhage into the vitreous body. The results of photocoagulation treatment in chronic oedema of the macula and treatment of neovascularization are of a long-term character. ",0
1318,23856559,"Effect of dronabinol on progression in progressive multiple sclerosis (CUPID): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial","""BACKGROUND: Laboratory evidence has shown that cannabinoids might have a neuroprotective action. We investigated whether oral dronabinol (Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol) might slow the course of progressive multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In this multicentre, parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we recruited patients aged 18-65 years with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis from 27 UK neurology or rehabilitation departments. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive dronabinol or placebo for 36 months; randomisation was by stochastic minimisation, using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, balanced according to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, centre, and disease type. Maximum dose was 28 mg per day, titrated against bodyweight and adverse effects. Primary outcomes were EDSS score progression (masked assessor, time to progression of >/=1 point from a baseline score of 4.0-5.0 or >/=0.5 points from a baseline score of >/=5.5, confirmed after 6 months) and change from baseline in the physical impact subscale of the 29-item multiple sclerosis impact scale (MSIS-29-PHYS). All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (ISRCTN 62942668). FINDINGS: Of the 498 patients randomly assigned to a treatment group, 329 received at least one dose of dronabinol and 164 received at least one dose of placebo (five did not receive the allocated intervention). 145 patients in the dronabinol group had EDSS score progression (0.24 first progression events per patient-year; crude rate) compared with 73 in the placebo group (0.23 first progression events per patient-year; crude rate); HR for prespecified primary analysis was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68-1.23; p=0.57). Mean yearly change in MSIS-29-PHYS score was 0.62 points (SD 3.29) in the dronabinol group versus 1.03 points (3.74) in the placebo group. Primary analysis with a multilevel model gave an estimated between-group difference (dronabinol-placebo) of -0.9 points (95% CI -2.0 to 0.2). We noted no serious safety concerns (114 [35%] patients in the dronabinol group had at least one serious adverse event, compared with 46 [28%] in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that dronabinol has no overall effect on the progression of multiple sclerosis in the progressive phase. The findings have implications for the design of future studies of progressive multiple sclerosis, because lower than expected progression rates might have affected our ability to detect clinical change.

1319,25560091,Correlations between homocysteine and grey matter volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease,"Previous studies have reported that elevated total homocysteine levels are associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, few studies have examined the radiological markers of associated neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that elevated levels of homocysteine are associated with cerebral grey matter volume loss. We compared the grey matter in a high homocysteine group and a normal homocysteine group using an optimized voxel-based morphometry. The study included 79 patients with AD who were divided into two groups: a high homocysteine group and a normal homocysteine group. The participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging using a standardized protocol and neurocognitive evaluation. Homocysteine tests and other routine laboratory examinations for dementia assessment were carried out in all patients. There was no significant difference in grey matter volume between the patients with high homocysteine levels and those with normal homocysteine levels. A multiple regression analysis also revealed that the levels of homocysteine were not associated with the grey matter volume in patients with AD. Homocysteine levels were not correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State Examination, Global Deterioration Scale, or Clinical Dementia Rating. Our results showed that elevated homocysteine levels are not associated with reduced cerebral grey matter volume in AD. Larger samples will be needed to assess potential correlations between homocysteine and neuroanatomical pathology in the future. ",0
1320,990171,Physical training and connective tissues in young mice. Biochemistry of skin,"The effect of physical training on some connective tissue components of the skin was studied in male mice of NMRI-strain. The mice to be trained and their controls were about 2-weeks-old at the beginning of the training, which took place on a 5 degree inclined treadmill 5 days a week for 3-22 weeks progressively. The final exercise bouts were 50 and 80 min for moderate programmes and 180 min for the intensive programme at a speed of 30 cm/s. At the end of each experiment skin samples from trained and control animals were taken for the analyses. We found increased concentrations of nitrogen, hexosamines and hydroxyproline in the skin of the trained mice compared to the controls. The unchanged DNA concentration suggests that the activation of synthesis occurred in a constant number of cells. ",0
1321,12695153,"Factors associated with toxicity, final dose, and efficacy of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis","OBJECTIVE: To study factors associated with toxicity, final dose, and efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Data were used from a randomised clinical 48 week trial on 411 patients with RA all treated with MTX, comparing folates and placebo. Logistic regression was used to study the relation between baseline variables and various dependent factors, including hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase >/=3 x upper limit of normal), MTX withdrawal, final MTX dose >/=15 mg/week, and MTX efficacy. RESULTS: Addition of folates to MTX treatment was strongly related to the lack of hepatotoxicity. Next to this, high body mass index was related to the occurrence of hepatotoxicity. Prior gastrointestinal (GI) events and younger age were related to the adverse event, diarrhoea. Hepatotoxicity and GI adverse events were the main reason for MTX withdrawal, which in turn was associated with the absence of folate supplementation, body mass index, prior GI events, and female sex. Renal function (creatinine clearance >/=50 ml/min) was not associated with toxicity. Reaching a final dose of MTX of >/=15 mg/week was related to folate supplementation and the absence of prior GI events. Efficacy of MTX treatment was associated with low disease activity at baseline, male sex, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lower creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: MTX toxicity, final dose, and efficacy are influenced by folate supplementation. Baseline characteristics predicting the outcome of MTX treatment are mainly prior GI events, body mass index, sex, use of NSAIDs, and creatinine clearance.",1
1322,6479858,Pneumococcal vaccination: the response of patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis,"Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of dying from pneumococcal pneumonia. Their immunological response to pneumococcal vaccination is not known. We compared the antibody response to challenge with a 14-valent purified pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in 15 patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic liver cirrhosis, 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preimmunization levels for Danish type 1 pneumococcal polysaccharide were lower among cirrhotics than patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Four and 12 weeks after immunization, no significant differences were found in antibody concentrations between the three groups. We conclude that patients with alcoholic cirrhosis can produce an adequate antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigen.",0
1323,29669226,Gene Therapy in Patients with Transfusion-Dependent ?-Thalassemia,"BACKGROUND: Donor availability and transplantation-related risks limit the broad use of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation in patients with transfusion-dependent ?-thalassemia. After previously establishing that lentiviral transfer of a marked ?-globin (?(A-T87Q)) gene could substitute for long-term red-cell transfusions in a patient with ?-thalassemia, we wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such gene therapy in patients with transfusion-dependent ?-thalassemia. METHODS: In two phase 1-2 studies, we obtained mobilized autologous CD34+ cells from 22 patients (12 to 35 years of age) with transfusion-dependent ?-thalassemia and transduced the cells ex vivo with LentiGlobin BB305 vector, which encodes adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbA(T87Q)). The cells were then reinfused after the patients had undergone myeloablative busulfan conditioning. We subsequently monitored adverse events, vector integration, and levels of replication-competent lentivirus. Efficacy assessments included levels of total hemoglobin and HbA(T87Q), transfusion requirements, and average vector copy number. RESULTS: At a median of 26 months (range, 15 to 42) after infusion of the gene-modified cells, all but 1 of the 13 patients who had a non-?(0)/?(0) genotype had stopped receiving red-cell transfusions; the levels of HbA(T87Q) ranged from 3.4 to 10.0 g per deciliter, and the levels of total hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 to 13.7 g per deciliter. Correction of biologic markers of dyserythropoiesis was achieved in evaluated patients with hemoglobin levels near normal ranges. In 9 patients with a ?(0)/?(0) genotype or two copies of the IVS1-110 mutation, the median annualized transfusion volume was decreased by 73%, and red-cell transfusions were discontinued in 3 patients. Treatment-related adverse events were typical of those associated with autologous stem-cell transplantation. No clonal dominance related to vector integration was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BB305 vector reduced or eliminated the need for long-term red-cell transfusions in 22 patients with severe ?-thalassemia without serious adverse events related to the drug product.

1324,23234465,Fulminant hepatic failure in association with quetiapine: a case report,"INTRODUCTION: Fulminant hepatic failure is a serious disease with significant mortality and morbidity. Identifying the exact cause of hepatic failure and predicting prognosis is of paramount importance in managing such patients. Drug-induced liver injury is a common but challenging entity to treat. The use of newer drugs and medications with previously unknown hepatotoxicity add to the challenges faced by treating physicians. Quetiapine is an antipsychotic that has rarely been linked to acute liver injury. In the present work we describe a case of fulminant hepatic failure secondary to use of quetiapine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman with known Parkinson's disease was being treated with quetiapine for hallucinations. She was referred to our hospital with yellow discoloration of the sclera and later on developed clinical features suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. A diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure was made following her admission to the intensive care unit. Her condition improved after discontinuing the drug and providing the standard supportive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in the present report emphasize the importance of keeping an open mind in cases of fulminant hepatic failure. As drug-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of fulminant hepatic failure in many parts of the world, consideration should be given to the medication(s) patients receive as the potential cause and a review of this list should be part of the clinical care given.",1
1325,24962711,Results from a Nationwide Cohort Temporary Utilization Authorization (ATU) survey of patients in france treated with Pheburane(�) (Sodium Phenylbutyrate) taste-masked granules,"""OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe a nationwide system for pre-marketing follow-up (cohort temporary utilization authorization [ATU] protocol; i.e., 'therapeutic utilization') of a new taste-masked formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) granules (Pheburane(�)) in France and to analyze safety and efficacy in this treated cohort of patients with urea cycle disease (UCD). METHODS: In October 2012, a cohort ATU was established in France to monitor the use of Pheburane(�) on a named-patient basis. All treated UCD patients were included in a follow-up protocol developed by the Laboratory (Lucane Pharma) and the French Medicines Agency (ANSM), which recorded demographics, dosing characteristics of NaPB, concomitant medications, adverse events, and clinical outcome during the period of treatment. Following the granting of the Marketing Authorization in Europe, the cohort ATU was terminated approximately 1 year after its initiation, as the product was launched on the French market. RESULTS: The ease of administration and acceptability were much better with the new taste-masked formulation than with the previous treatment. No episodes of metabolic decompensation were observed over a treatment period ranging from 3 to 11�months with Pheburane(�) and the range of ammonia and glutamine plasma levels improved and remained within the normal range. In all, no adverse events were reported with Pheburane(�) treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The recently developed taste-masked formulation of NaPB granules improved the quality of life for UCD patients. This may translate into improved compliance, efficacy, and safety, which may be demonstrated either in further studies or in the post-marketing use of the product.""",1

However, hepatitis occurring after acute administration of AD has only occasionally been reported and the pathologic findings in the liver in this condition have not been well characterized. We describe an idiosyncratic reaction, in a 40-year-old man after 6 weeks of oral AD therapy, consisting of acute hepatitis, which resolved after withdrawal of the drug. The liver biopsy showed clusters of cells with granular cytoplasm. These cells were characterized as macrophages, and phospholipid membranous inclusions were demonstrated ultrastructurally in the granular cells and in the hepatocytes. Pathologists and clinicians should be aware of this subtle histologic finding when looking for evidence to support AD hepatotoxicity.",1

We report a patient with an acute hepatitis after intake of an oral green tea derivative claiming protection against hair loss, showing a histological image compatible with drug induced hepatitis. Other important causes of hepatitis were excluded. After cessation of this nutritional additive there was a rapid and sustained recovery. We raise concern about the safety of nutritional additives with few proven beneficial effects and want to emphasize the importance of accurate and thorough history taking, with attention for over the counter drugs and herbal products.",1
1329,19957374,Retinoic acid signaling positively regulates liver specification by inducing wnt2bb gene expression in medaka,"During vertebrate embryogenesis, the liver develops at a precise location along the endodermal primitive gut tube because of signaling delivered by adjacent mesodermal tissues. Although several signaling molecules have been associated with liver formation, the molecular mechanism that regulates liver specification is still unclear. We previously performed a screen in medaka to isolate mutants with impaired liver development. The medaka hio mutants exhibit a profound (but transient) defect in liver specification that resembles the liver formation defect found in zebrafish prometheus (prt) mutants, whose mutation occurs in the wnt2bb gene. In addition to their liver abnormality, hio mutants lack pectoral fins and die after hatching. Positional cloning indicated that the hio mutation affects the raldh2 gene encoding retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type2 (RALDH2), the enzyme principally responsible for retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis. Mutations of raldh2 in zebrafish preclude the development of pectoral fins. Interestingly, in hio mutants, expression of wnt2bb in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) directly adjacent to the liver-forming endoderm was completely lost. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal the unexpected finding that RA signaling positively regulates the wnt2bb gene expression required for liver specification in medaka. These results suggest that a common molecular mechanism may underlie liver and pectoral fin specification during piscine embryogenesis.",0
1330,25261264,Effects of physiological and/or disease status on the response of postpartum dairy cows to synchronization of estrus using an intravaginal progesterone device,"Progesterone treatments are used to increase submission rates in postpartum dairy cows; however, in many cases the protocol is used as a blanket therapy for all cows without regard for physiological or disease state. The objective of this study was to identify the physiological or disease classes of cows that respond well (or not) to synchronization of estrus via progesterone. Dairy cows (n = 402) were monitored peri and postpartum to establish their physiological or disease status. Animals were classified as having negative energy balance, clinical lameness, uterine infection (UI), anovulatory anestrus, high somatic cell counts, and healthy (H). Blood samples were collected at five different time points and analyzed for metabolites. All animals received an 8-day controlled internal drug release protocol, which included GnRH at insertion and PGF2α the day before removal. Response to the protocol was determined by visual observation of estrus synchronization. Conception rate was determined by ultrasonography between Days 32 and 35 after artificial insemination. Animals without UI were 1.9 times more likely to respond and two times more likely to be confirmed pregnant than those with UI. There was no relationship between negative energy balance and clinical lameness in the visual estrous response, but both conditions were associated with reduced conception rates. Dairy cows in anovulatory anestrus responded successfully to the protocol in both estrous response and conception rates. High glutathione peroxidase concentrations had a positive effect on conception rates, whereas high non-esterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate had a negative effect on the estrous response. In conclusion, disease and physiological states of dairy cows determined the response to progesterone-based synchronization. The more disease or physiological problems the cows had, the lower the estrous response and conception rates; cows with these problems were not ideal candidates for synchronization. Both anestrus and healthy dairy cows were good responders to progesterone-based synchronization. ",0
1331,31398176,Perspective for evaluation of microrna in plasma and bile for differential diagnosis of obstructive biliary tract disease,"Introduction: Cholelithiasisis diagnosed in 10-25% of the adult population. The manifestation of cholelithiasis in the form of acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, jaundice etc. occurs with a probability of 2-3% or more per year depending on the risk factors. Most often, it manifests it self as acute calculous cholecystitis. Up to 20% of such patients have additional calculi in extrahepatic bile ducts requiring simultaneous surgical intervention. Currently, the algorithm for diagnosis of concomitant choledocholithiasis in acute cholecystitis is multilevel and it needs to be simplified and improved. Conventional non-invasive diagnostic techniques have low specificity and sensitivity. A new safe diagnostic test is needed for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis in cholecystitis in order to improve the results of surgical treatment of patients. The aim of the study - to determine the prospects for diagnosis of microRNA for differential diagnosis of obstructive diseases of the biliary tract on the basis of the literature data. Materials and methods: The analysis of the selected international literature in the period of 1991-2018 concerning the studies of microRNA in cholestatic liver diseases was carried out. The search for literature was conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed search engines for the following keywords: microRNA, cholestasis, choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction in their various combinations. Review: MicroRNA is a specific post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression in all organs and systems of the body. There are specific types of miRNAs for different tissues. The most studied type of liver miRNA is miR-122. The studies showed better sensitivity and specificity of the detection of miR-122 both in the plasma and in the bile for the diagnosis of pathological liver conditions compared with conventional liver tests (aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase). Regarding the cholestatic hepatocyte injury occurring in choledocholithiasis, the following types of miRNA were identified: 122, 21, 29, 125, 222, let-7, 98 etc. Their concentrations in plasma and bile can be used as a diagnostic test for the presence of concomitant benign cholestasis in acute cholecystitis. Moreover, these markers can be used for the differential diagnosis of cholestasis of different etiology. Conclusions: Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of microRNA in bile and plasma can be used as an additional non-invasive method for diagnosis of cholestasis induced by choledocholithiasis in acute calculous cholecystitis. Further studyis needed to identify the most optimal algorithm for the administration of microRNA in clinical practice. ",0
1332,12056704,"Phase I, dose-finding study of capecitabine in combination with docetaxel and epirubicin as first-line chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer","PURPOSE: Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine with considerable activity and minimal myelosuppression and alopecia. This phase I study evaluated the addition of capecitabine to epirubicin/docetaxel combination therapy as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three female patients with advanced breast cancer received capecitabine (765-1060 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 of a 3-week treatment cycle) in combination with epirubicin and docetaxel (75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1). RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine was 985 mg/m2 and the principal dose-limiting toxicity was febrile neutropenia. No grade 3/4 anemia or thrombocytopenia occurred. There were no grade 4 non-hematological events and grade 3 events other than alopecia were rare. Alopecia occurred in all patients and treatment cycles, and asthenia occurred in all patients and in 84% of treatment cycles. Other frequent adverse events included nausea, vomiting, fever, paresthesia and elevated transaminase levels. An objective response to treatment was observed in 91% (95% confidence interval 72% to 99%) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of capecitabine to docetaxel/epirubicin combination therapy provides a well-tolerated and active first-line chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced breast cancer, and merits phase II/III evaluation.",1
1333,31392834,Association between socioeconomic status and small-for-gestational-age in Japan: A single center retrospective cohort study,"Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status has negative health consequences in neonates and later life. Low socioeconomic status (SES) is a reported risk factor for adverse birth outcomes, such as SGA and preterm birth (PTB). The present study investigated whether maternal SES is associated with adverse outcomes in Japanese pregnant women. Retrospective data were collected for 1970 Japanese women with singleton pregnancies who delivered between January 2007 and December 2011 at a single center: low SES group (n = 197); and controls (n = 1773). Low SES was defined according to the criteria of the Japanese pregnant-childbirth hospitalization support policy system. The low SES group included a significantly higher proportion of young women, women with single marital status, greater parity, pre-pregnancy smoking and a lack of regular employment (P < 0.001, respectively). The crude odds ratio (OR) for the association between low maternal SES and SGA was 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.82, P = 0.010). After adjustment for baseline maternal age, parity, body mass index, smoking and gestational weight gain, the adjusted OR for the association between low maternal SES and SGA was 1.92 (95% CI 1.17-3.17, P = 0.010). No significant association was found between maternal SES and PTB. The present results suggest that low maternal SES is associated with SGA births in the Japanese population. Mitigation of low maternal SES could be urgent public health to prevent disadvantage birth outcome. ",0
1334,6093526,Clinical adverse effects during ceftriaxone therapy,"""The clinical safety of ceftriaxone administered at various doses for time periods ranging from a single injection to up to six weeks was evaluated in 2,640 patients treated in 153 individual studies. The incidence of clinical adverse effects was greatest for gastrointestinal (3.45 percent), hypersensitivity (2.99 percent), and local (1.86 percent) reactions. When the pediatric population was analyzed separately, the incidence of gastrointestinal and hypersensitivity reactions was 5.63 and 3.3 percent, respectively; all other reactions occurred in fewer than 1 percent of patients. The frequency of adverse effects for the once-daily and twice-daily dosing regimens was comparable, except for a statistically significant increase in local reactions when ceftriaxone was administered twice daily. When ceftriaxone was compared directly with other antibiotic regimens, the incidence of clinical adverse effects was similar. Ceftriaxone appears to be safe and well tolerated from a clinical standpoint.""",1
1335,994744,Structure-function activity of azasterols and nitrogen-containing steroids,"Thirty-nine nitrogen-containing steroids were tested against two gram-negative, five gram-positive, and two yeast organisms. Many of these steroids have been previously reported to inhibit various metabolic processes involving sterol metabolism. While low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were recorded for sterol producing yeast, growth of bacteria which contain no sterols was also inhibited. Structure-function studies provided no relationship between biological activity and hypocholesteremic effects of these azasteroids. A hypothesis put forward is that amino and azasteroids are effectors of membrane which, in the case of mitochondria, lead to changes in adenosine triphosphate levels and/or dehydrogenase activity. Their effects on sterol metabolism, therefore, may be of secondary consideration. ",0
1336,8432484,Effect of octreotide on gall stone prevalence and gall bladder motility in acromegaly,"Octreotide therapy in acromegaly is associated with an increased prevalence of gall stones, which may be the result of an inhibition of gall bladder motility. Gall stone prevalence in untreated acromegalic patients relative to the general population is unknown, however, and the presence of gall stones and gall bladder motility in these patients and in acromegalic patients receiving octreotide was therefore examined. Thirty four percent of 39 patients who had taken octreotide for a mean of 20 months had gall stones compared with 16% of 38 patients who had not been treated with octreotide (p < 0.005). In a subgroup of 21 patients studied prospectively over 4 to 18 months, two patients developed stones. No patient had symptoms referrable to their gall stones. In 31 untreated acromegalic patients, the mean fasting gall bladder volume was similar to that in normal subjects. Maximal percentage emptying, however, was impaired (34 v 64%, p < 0.001) and the mean postprandial residual gall bladder volume increased (21.7 v 9.0 ml, p < 0.001). Treatment with octreotide increased the mean postprandial residual volume further to 36.8 ml (p < 0.001). Gall bladder emptying in untreated acromegalic subjects is impaired. Octreotide further increases postprandial residual gall bladder volume and this may be a factor in the increased gall stone prevalence seen in these patients.",1
1337,15295050,Primary care physicians who treat blacks and whites,"""BACKGROUND: In the United States, black patients generally receive lower-quality health care than white patients. Black patients may receive their care from a subgroup of physicians whose qualifications or resources are inferior to those of the physicians who treat white patients. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 150,391 visits by black Medicare beneficiaries and white Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age or older for medical """"evaluation and management"""" who were seen by 4355 primary care physicians who participated in a biannual telephone survey, the 2000-2001 Community Tracking Study Physician Survey. RESULTS: Most visits by black patients were with a small group of physicians (80 percent of visits were accounted for by 22 percent of physicians) who provided only a small percentage of care to white patients. In a comparison of visits by white patients and black patients, we found that the physicians whom the black patients visited were less likely to be board certified (77.4 percent) than were the physicians visited by the white patients (86.1 percent, P=0.02) and also more likely to report that they were unable to provide high-quality care to all their patients (27.8 percent vs. 19.3 percent, P=0.005). The physicians treating black patients also reported facing greater difficulties in obtaining access for their patients to high-quality subspecialists, high-quality diagnostic imaging, and nonemergency admission to the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients and white patients are to a large extent treated by different physicians. The physicians treating black patients may be less well trained clinically and may have less access to important clinical resources than physicians treating white patients. Further research should be conducted to address the extent to which these differences may be responsible for disparities in health care.""",0

1339,8022446,The difficult issue of second-trimester abortion,"In the US, 10.2% of legal abortions are performed at 13-20 weeks and an additional 1% occur at 21 weeks gestation or beyond. These second-trimester abortions account for about 140,000 procedures per year. Dilatation and evacuation; instillation of saline, urea, or medication into the amniotic cavity; and intravenous prostaglandin administration are the approaches available for these procedures. At present, intravaginal prostaglandin E is the most commonly used mid-trimester abortion method; new research suggests that intravaginal misoprostol may confer advantages. Since teenagers are the population group most likely to delay abortion until the second trimester, priority should be given to making abortion services more accessible and removing requirements such as parental consent. Most beneficial would be a preventive approach that decreases the number of unintended pregnancies among adolescents through school-based sex education programs and access to free, effective contraceptive methods. Problematic is the reluctance on the part of many obstetricians and gynecologists to perform abortions due to a lack of technical training or moral objections. These practitioners should be mandated to fulfill their obligation to meet the needs of their patients, regardless of their personal views on the abortion issues.",0
1340,16183489,"""""""Radical but conservative"""" is the main goal for ultrasonography-guided liver resection: prospective validation of this approach""","Despite higher blood loss, morbidity, and mortality, rate of major resection is still high in most surgical institutions because of fear of incomplete tumor removal. To verify whether intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) minimizes the rate of major hepatectomies while maintaining treatment radicality, we have prospectively validated our policy, based on extensive use of IOUS resection guidance. Ninety-three consecutive patients with liver tumors were prospectively enrolled. There were 61 men and 32 women with a mean age of 65.6 years. Fifty-nine patients had hepatocellular carcinoma and 34 had colorectal cancer liver metastases. Surgical strategy was based on the relationship between the tumor and intrahepatic vascular structures at IOUS. Rates of major and minor resection, mortality, morbidity, and rate of local recurrences were evaluated. There was no hospital mortality; major morbidity occurred in 2.2% of patients and minor complications in 17%. Six (6.5%) patients required blood transfusion. Major resections (two or more segments) were accomplished in 14 patients (15%), and 5 (5.4%) patients had more than three segments removed. Major vascular invasion was present in 16 patients (17%), and contact without infiltration with major vessels was present in another 16; part of the wall of the inferior vena cava was resected in 1 patient. Surgical clearance was achieved in all patients without local recurrence at a mean followup of 18 months (median 13, range 6 to 52 months). This study shows that liver operations performed under IOUS guidance are safe and radical and reduce need for major hepatectomies. ",0
1341,21428848,Drug safety evaluation of exemestane,"INTRODUCTION: Hormone-dependent breast cancer can be successfully treated by either blocking the estrogen receptor, as with tamoxifen, or reducing the production of estrogens, as with aromatase inhibitors. Exemestane is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In various trials, exemestane has shown superiority over tamoxifen in both efficacy and safety. Furthermore, aromatase inhibitors are gaining territory in the metastatic, as well as the early, setting for treating patients with breast cancer. AREAS COVERED: The authors describe the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of exemestane and discuss its efficacy and safety within the framework of currently approved and potential new indications. The reader can expect a full update on the characteristics of exemestane, including its efficacy and safety profile compared with tamoxifen and other third-generation aromatase inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: Exemestane is a safe drug due to its steroidal structure, which blocks aromatase at a different site to nonsteroidal AIs (eg., anastrozole and letrozole). Noncross-resistance with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors makes it an attractive alternative for all clinical indications of aromatase inhibitors in patients with breast cancer.",1
1342,23821437,Activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria in the human airway epithelium,"Influenza is an acute infection of the respiratory tract, which affects each year millions of people. Influenza virus infection is initiated by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) through receptor binding and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to gain its fusion capacity. Although cleavage of HA is crucial for virus infectivity, little was known about relevant proteases in the human airways for a long time. Recent progress in the identification and characterization of HA-activating host cell proteases has been considerable however and supports the idea of targeting HA cleavage as a novel approach for influenza treatment. Interestingly, certain bacteria have been demonstrated to support HA activation either by secreting proteases that cleave HA or due to activation of cellular proteases and thereby may contribute to virus spread and enhanced pathogenicity. In this review, we give an overview on activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria with the main focus on recent progress on HA cleavage by proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 in the human airway epithelium. In addition, we outline investigations of HA-activating proteases as potential drug targets for influenza treatment.  ",0

Itraconazole is effective and well tolerated, with most side effects being minor and reversible. The most common adverse events are gastrointestinal upset, headache, and transient skin reaction. There have also been rare reports of hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the hepatic safety of pulse and continuous itraconazole in the treatment of onychomycosis. METHODS: An analysis was performed on all itraconazole clinical trials sponsored by Janssen Research Foundation in the treatment of onychomycosis, where there was an assessment of laboratory safety. A review of the published literature was also undertaken to assess the hepatic safety of itraconazole in common practice. RESULTS: The data indicate that itraconazole pulse treatment is safe, with no significant differences in the number of code 4 abnormalities (baseline value is in the normal range and at least two values, or the last testing in the observation period, exceed twice the upper limit of normal) in the liver function parameters studied: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. The incidence of all the code 4 abnormalities was below 2%. In the literature there are reports of symptomatic hepatitis with itraconazole continuous therapy but no published report of symptomatic hepatotoxicity using the pulse regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Itraconazole pulse therapy for onychomycosis appears to be safe, especially from the perspective of potential liver damage. In the itraconazole package insert liver function tests are recommended for patients receiving continuous itraconazole for periods of time exceeding 1 month. There is no such monitoring requirement for the pulse regimen unless the patient has a history of underlying hepatic disease, the liver function tests are abnormal at baseline, or at any time that there is the development of signs or symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction.",1

1346,21122554,Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and inflammatory bowel disease,"""OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current literature and knowledge about hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), providing an overview of the clinical features, a description of its pathology and immunophenotypic traits in relation to other lymphomas. In addition, we explore the history of reported cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in relation to the possible existence of a causal relationship between infliximab use and HSTCL. The treatments for HSTCL will be briefly addressed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using multiple databases was performed. Keyword search phrases including """"lymphoma,"""" """"hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma,"""" """"Inflammatory bowel disease,"""" """"6-mercaptopurine,"""" and """"infliximab"""" were used in various combinations. In addition references from published papers were reviewed as well. RESULTS: There are over 200 reported cases of HSTCL. Only 22 cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma are associated with IBD treatment. Clinicians usually reserve immunomodulators and biologics for moderate to severe IBD cases. The ultimate goal of therapy is to control inflammation and therefore allow mucosal healing. IBD patients demonstrating mucosal healing are less likely to undergo surgery and experience complications related to their disease. We manipulate the immune system with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, therefore causing bone marrow suppression. With bone marrow suppression, malignant degeneration may begin through selective uncontrolled cell proliferation, initiating HSTCL development in the genetically susceptible. CONCLUSION: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is a rare disease, often with a poor outcome. With the increasing number of reported cases of HSTCL linked to the use of infliximab, adalimumab, and AZA/6-MP, there appears to be an undeniable association of HSTCL development with the use of these agents. This risk is unquantifiable. When considering the rarity of cases and the multiple complications with uncontrolled disease, however, the benefit of treatment far outweighs the risk.""",1

ApoC-III is an important emerging target linking hypertriglyceridemia with CVD. ApoC-III is a potent modulator of many established CVD risk factors, and is found on chylomicrons, very-low density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein particles. Recent studies show that in humans, apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD, and its presence on lipoproteins may promote their atherogenicity. This year, two large-scale epidemiological studies have linked mutations in apoC-III with increased incidence of CVD and hypertriglyceridemia. ApoC-III raises plasma triglycerides through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, stimulation of very-low density lipoprotein secretion, and is a novel factor in modulating intestinal triglyceride trafficking. ApoC-III also stimulates inflammatory processes in the vasculature and the pancreas. The combination of raising plasma triglycerides and independently stimulating inflammatory processes makes apoC-III a valuable target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, or for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled. Clinical trials on apoC-III antisense oligonucleotides are in progress. ApoC-III is a potent direct modulator of established CVD risk factors: plasma triglycerides and inflammation. Recent findings show that changes in apoC-III levels are directly associated with changes in cardiovascular risk and the atherogenicity of the lipoproteins on which apoC-III resides. Emerging roles of apoC-III include a role in directing the atherogenicity of high-density lipoprotein, intestinal dietary triglyceride trafficking, and modulating pancreatic β-cell survival. The combination of these roles makes apoC-III an important therapeutic target for the management and prevention of CVD. ",0

1352,25239152,Reproducibility of telomere length assessment: an international collaborative study,"Telomere length is a putative biomarker of ageing, morbidity and mortality. Its application is hampered by lack of widely applicable reference ranges and uncertainty regarding the present limits of measurement reproducibility within and between laboratories. We instigated an international collaborative study of telomere length assessment: 10 different laboratories, employing 3 different techniques [Southern blotting, single telomere length analysis (STELA) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)] performed two rounds of fully blinded measurements on 10 human DNA samples per round to enable unbiased assessment of intra- and inter-batch variation between laboratories and techniques. Absolute results from different laboratories differed widely and could thus not be compared directly, but rankings of relative telomere lengths were highly correlated (correlation coefficients of 0.63-0.99). Intra-technique correlations were similar for Southern blotting and qPCR and were stronger than inter-technique ones. However, inter-laboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) averaged about 10% for Southern blotting and STELA and more than 20% for qPCR. This difference was compensated for by a higher dynamic range for the qPCR method as shown by equal variance after z-scoring. Technical variation per laboratory, measured as median of intra- and inter-batch CVs, ranged from 1.4% to 9.5%, with differences between laboratories only marginally significant (P = 0.06). Gel-based and PCR-based techniques were not different in accuracy. Intra- and inter-laboratory technical variation severely limits the usefulness of data pooling and excludes sharing of reference ranges between laboratories. We propose to establish a common set of physical telomere length standards to improve comparability of telomere length estimates between laboratories. ",0

In Phase II studies, 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was the highest Q2W dose studied, and it is currently the highest Q2W dose under development. To better assess the safety and efficacy of this dose, data across three Phase II studies were pooled. METHODS: We analyzed data from three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II studies of 8 or 12 weeks' duration. In the current analysis, 77 patients were randomized to the control group and 108 were randomized to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W administered via a single 1 mL subcutaneous injection. RESULTS: Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 58.3% of alirocumab patients compared with 54.5% of placebo-controlled patients. The most common AE was mild, transient injection-site reactions. No signal for muscle symptoms such as myalgia and no cases of neurocognitive effects were reported or observed. One alirocumab patient, also receiving atorvastatin 80 mg/day, had an increase in aspartate transaminase 3 to 5 times the upper limit of normal. Alirocumab 150 mg Q2W reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline by 68.4% compared with 10.5% for the control group. More than 90% of patients achieved an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL with alirocumab versus 8% with control. Marked reductions in other atherogenic lipids and modest increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also observed. CONCLUSION: At the highest Q2W dose under development (150 mg), alirocumab appears well tolerated and produces robust LDL-C reductions. These data suggest that alirocumab 150 mg Q2W is an appropriate dose for further evaluation in Phase III trials.",1

Glycated insulin circulated at 0.10 +/- 0.04 ng/ml and 2.20 +/- 0.14 ng/ml in lean and diabetic obese (ob/ob) mice, corresponding to 12.5 and 9.8% total plasma insulin, respectively. The concentration of glycated insulin was elevated 22-fold in obese mice compared to controls (P < 0.001). In the pancreas, glycated insulin was 48 +/- 10 and 83 +/- 4 ng/g wt (P < 0.05) in lean and obese mice, respectively, representing approximately 2% total insulin in the diabetic pancreas (4.60 +/- 0.17 microg/g wt). ICC revealed fluorescent positively stained cells in pancreatic islets from hydrocortisone (HC)-treated diabetic rats. Fasting of HC-treated rats, resulted in 3-fold and 15-fold reductions in plasma glycated insulin (P < 0.01) and insulin (P < 0.001), respectively. Following a 30 min feeding period in these insulin resistant rats, plasma glucose, insulin, and glycated insulin increased (P < 0.001) rapidly with 1.4-, 1.6-, and 2.9-fold elevations, respectively. Injection of HC-treated rats with insulin (50 U/kg) resulted in a rapid 33% decrease of plasma glucose (P < 0.001) and a marked 4-fold increase in plasma insulin (P < 0.01), whereas glycated insulin concentrations remained unchanged. Since glycation of insulin impairs biological activity, physiologically regulated secretion of glycated insulin into the circulation in diabetic animal models suggests a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

1359,11983042,Acetaminophen toxicity: suicidal vs. accidental,"INTRODUCTION: Acetaminophen toxicity, which can lead to hepatotoxicity, is a burden on our health care system and contributes significantly to intensive care unit admissions and cost of hospitalization. The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiology of various types of acetaminophen poisoning and analyze their outcome compared with their admission characteristics. METHODS: We identified 93 consecutive patients, hospitalized for acetaminophen toxicity over a 52-month period from 1996 to 1999 in our urban county hospital. Retrospective case-control analysis was carried out using the data obtained from the medical records. RESULTS: Acetaminophen accounted for 7.5% of all cases of poisoning admitted during this period. Of the 93 patients, 80 were classified as suicidal and 13 had accidentally poisoned themselves in an attempt to relieve pain. The ratio of females to males was found to be 2:1. Of the 93 patients studied, 88 were admitted to the intensive care unit for initial 24-48 hours of monitoring. Peak acetaminophen levels were higher in the suicidal overdose group (mean 121.7 +/- 97.0 mg/l vs. 64.5 +/- 61.8 mg/l, P < 0.05) than in the accidental group. In spite of this, peak aminotransferase levels >1000 IU/l were more often seen in the latter (39% vs. 12%, P < 0.05). Hepatic coma and death were seen more often in the accidental overdose group (15% vs 0%, P < 0.05). Interestingly chronic alcohol abuse was also more frequent in the accidental overdose category (39% vs 18%, P = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Although the peak acetaminophen level in the suicidal group was significantly higher, cases of therapeutic misadventure had higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Peak acetaminophen levels correlate poorly with hepatic dysfunction, morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: We recommend that the patients with suicidal acetaminophen overdose, without any concomitant poisoning, can safely managed on the medical floors.",1

This study describes the histomorphological features of femoral thin sections from six uni- and bi-lateral amputees of documented age and sex. Thin sections were cut from the midshaft of both the right and left femora from each amputee and analyzed following standard forensic methods for histological estimation of age at death from the human femur. The histological age at death estimations for the thin sections from amputated bone were consistently lower than the actual chronological age of each individual, suggesting that the effects of amputation prohibit the effective use of age at death estimation methods. The nature of each amputation is unknown, which suggests that alternative factors could be responsible for the slowed bone turnover seen in the thin sections from the amputated bone. First, it is reasonable to assume that the amputations in this sample could have resulted from complications of diabetes mellitus rather than trauma so the possible effects on bone remodeling due to disease are explored. Second, the mobility of the decedents following their amputations is unknown so the histomorphological results could be due to disuse osteoporosis. ",0
1361,8666334,Interleukin 1 beta markedly stimulates nitric oxide formation in the absence of other cytokines or lipopolysaccharide in primary cultured rat hepatocytes but not in Kupffer cells,"To investigate whether a single inflammatory cytokine could stimulate nitric oxide formation in the absence of other cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), NO was measured by the redox chemiluminescence method in primary cultured rat hepatocytes and in rat Kupffer cells. Interleukin (IL) 1 beta, but neither IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), nor LPS stimulated NO formation in a dose-dependent manner and induced half-maximal effects at 30 pmol/L. Maximal stimulation was achieved at 12 to 16 hours after the addition of 1I nmol/L of IL-1 beta, and was 50- to 60-fold above basal levels in rat hepatocytes. The combined effect of these cytokines with LPS or IFN-gamma on NO formation was also examined. Neither LPS nor IFN-gamma affected the IL-1 beta-induced NO formation. TNF-alpha, however, stimulated IL-1 beta-induced NO formation, while IL-6 inhibited it, although independently these cytokines had no effect on NO formation. None of the cytokines tested stimulated NO formation in cultured rat Kupffer cells. In hepatocytes, the NO formation induced by IL-l beta was blocked by both the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Furthermore, IL-1 beta markedly increased NOS activity, and this increase in activity was accompanied by the expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA). This study clearly demonstrated that IL-1 beta markedly stimulates NO formation in hepatocytes, in the absence of other cytokines or LPS.",0
1362,16180951,Effects of problem-oriented willed-movement therapy on motor abilities for people with poststroke cognitive deficits,"Cognitive deficits after stroke are common and interfere with recovery. One purpose of this study was to determine whether the motor abilities of subjects who have poststroke cognitive deficits and who have received problem-oriented willed-movement (POWM) therapy will improve more than the motor abilities of subjects in the reference group who have received neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT). Another purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between cognitive function and motor abilities for both groups. The subjects recruited for this study were 36 men and 11 women with various degrees of poststroke cognitive deficits. A randomized block design was used to assign the subjects to 2 groups. Cognitive function and motor ability were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM). Both groups received physical therapy 5 or 6 times per week in 50-minute sessions. The STREAM scores improved after treatment in both groups. Main group effects were found for the lower-extremity (F=4.58, P< .05) and basic mobility (F=27.49, P< .01) subscales of the STREAM. Pretest cognitive function showed a positive relationship with posttest motor ability in the NDT group (r = .446, P< .05). However, the relationship between pretest cognitive function and posttest motor ability had no statistical significance in the POWM group (r = .101, P= .630). These findings suggest that, regardless of a person's cognitive function, POWM intervention is effective in improving lower-extremity and basic mobilities and indicates the need to use relatively intact cognitive function or perceptual function, or both, to improve motor rehabilitation for people with cognitive function deficits.

1364,3584485,Granular cells as a marker of early amiodarone hepatotoxicity: a pathological and analytical study,"Two contrasting cases of amiodarone hepatotoxicity are described. In one, perivenular collections of swollen cells, probably macrophages, with granular cytoplasm in an otherwise nearly normal liver were observed. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the cytoplasmic granularity was due to lysosomal bodies of various sizes. X-ray energy and wavelength spectroscopic analysis showed a high iodine content in these lysosomal bodies, good presumptive evidence of the presence of amiodarone or one of its metabolites. In the second case there was a micronodular cirrhosis, and similar granular cells also containing iodine were seen in the fibrous connective tissue. These cases seem to represent the very early and late stages of amiodarone hepatotoxicity. In a patient taking this drug aggregates of swollen granular cells may be a sensitive and histopathologically useful marker of early amiodarone toxicity.",1
1365,16080072,The efficacy and safety of tigecycline in the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections: results of 2 double-blind phase 3 comparison studies with vancomycin-aztreonam,"""Two phase 3, double-blind studies in hospitalized adults with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) determined the safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus that of vancomycin-aztreonam. Patients received tigecycline (100 mg, followed by 50 mg intravenously twice daily) or vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice daily) plus aztreonam (2 g intravenously twice daily) for up to 14 days. Populations were as follows: 1116 patients (566 treated with tigecycline, and 550 treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, 1057 patients (538 treated with tigecycline, and 519 treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the clinical mITT (c-mITT) population, and 833 patients (422 treated with tigecycline, and 411 treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the clinically evaluable population. Clinical responses to tigecycline and vancomycin-aztreonam at test-of-cure were similar: c-mITT, 79.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.1%-83.1%) versus 81.9% (95% CI, 78.3%-85.1%) (P = .4183); and clinically evaluable, 86.5% (95% CI, 82.9%-89.6%) versus 88.6% (95% CI, 85.1%-91.5%) (P = .4233). Adverse events were similar, with increased nausea and vomiting in the tigecycline group and increased rash and elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels in the vancomycin-aztreonam group. Tigecycline monotherapy is as safe and efficacious as the vancomycin-aztreonam combination in treating patients with cSSSI.""",1
1366,15172900,Fondaparinux or enoxaparin for the initial treatment of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: The current standard initial therapies for deep venous thrombosis are low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a dose-ranging study of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, fondaparinux had efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether fondaparinux has efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin in patients with deep venous thrombosis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: 154 centers worldwide. PATIENTS: 2205 patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis. INTERVENTION: Fondaparinux, 7.5 mg (5.0 mg in patients weighing <50 kg and 10.0 mg in patients weighing >100 kg) subcutaneously once daily, or enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously twice daily for at least 5 days and until vitamin K antagonists induced an international normalized ratio greater than 2.0. MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic complications. The main safety outcomes were major bleeding during initial treatment and death. An independent, blinded committee adjudicated all outcomes. RESULTS: 43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin (absolute difference, -0.15 percentage point [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.5 percentage points]). Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Follow-up was incomplete in 0.4% of fondaparinux-treated patients and 1.0% of enoxaparin-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily subcutaneous fondaparinux was at least as effective (not inferior) and safe as twice-daily, body weight-adjusted enoxaparin in the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.",1

The hepatic enzyme disturbances normalized after discontinuation of pegvisomant. After rechallenge with monotherapy pegvisomant, however, the hepatic enzyme disturbances reappeared within a few weeks, indicating that most likely pegvisomant alone and not the long-acting somatostatin analog or the combination of these two drugs was responsible for this case of drug-induced hepatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this potential severe adverse drug reaction and therefore frequent control of hepatic enzymes is mandatory during treatment with pegvisomant.",1

1369,8124850,Intrahepatic cholestasis during nicotinic acid therapy,"""BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acid, widely used to lower serum cholesterol levels, may rarely cause cholestatic jaundice. SUMMARY: A 61-year-old white man with hypercholesterolemia complained of marked pruritus and became jaundiced after taking 3.0 g of crystalline nicotinic acid daily for 13 months. His total serum bilirubin level was increased at 144 mumol/L (8.4 mg/dL) and his alkaline phosphatase level was markedly elevated at 35.00 mukat/L (2100 U/L). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography failed to demonstrate an obstructive lesion in the extrahepatic biliary system, computed tomography showed no intrahepatic dilatation, and ultrasonographic studies of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas were normal; these factors all suggest intrahepatic cholestasis. Symptoms improved and liver function test results returned to normal within 51 days after stopping the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotinic acid-induced cholestatic jaundice may not be as rare as previously thought, and physicians should observe their patients for it.""",1
1370,25583832,Long-term safety and efficacy of dalfampridine for walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis: Results of open-label extensions of two Phase 3 clinical trials,"""BACKGROUND: In Phase 3 double-blind trials (MS-F203 and MS-F204), dalfampridine extended release tablets 10 mg twice daily (dalfampridine-ER; prolonged-release fampridine in Europe; fampridine modified or sustained release elsewhere) improved walking speed relative to placebo in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy of dalfampridine-ER in open-label extensions (MS-F203EXT, MS-F204EXT). METHODS: Patients received dalfampridine-ER 10 mg twice daily; and had Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) assessments at 2, 14 and 26 weeks, and then every 6 months. Subjects were categorized as dalfampridine-ER responders or non-responders, based on their treatment response in the double-blind parent trials that assessed T25FW. RESULTS: We had 269 patients enter MS-F203EXT and 154 patients complete it; for a maximum exposure of 5 years. We had 214 patients enter MS-F204EXT and 146 complete it; for a maximum exposure of 3.3 years. No new safety signals emerged and dalfampridine-ER tolerability was consistent with the double-blind phase. Improvements in walking speed were lost after dalfampridine-ER was discontinued in the parent trial, but returned by the 2-week assessment after re-initiation of the drug. Throughout the extensions, mean improvement in walking speed declined, but remained improved, among the double-blind responders as compared with non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: The dalfamipridine-ER safety profile was consistent with the parent trials. Although walking speed decreased over time, dalfampridine-ER responders continued to show improved walking speed, which was sustained compared with non-responders.""",1

METHODS: The goal of this double-blinded multicenter trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of rifaximin 550 mg administered once daily for 14 days compared with placebo in the prevention of TD during the dry season in Mexico. RESULTS: There were 101 participants randomized. Overall, 25 participants developed TD during the 3 weeks of the study: 22% from the rifaximin group and 29% from the placebo group (p = 0.4). Mild diarrhea (defined as only one or two unformed stools during a 24-h period plus at least one abdominal symptoms) developed in only 3 (6%) participants taking rifaximin compared with 10 (21%) taking placebo during the first week of study (p = 0.03). No clinically significant or serious adverse events were reported.

1372,31384599,The Effect of Arginine Intake on Colorectal Cancer: a Systematic Review of Literatures,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major reasons of mortality in the worldwide. There is clear evidence that some amino acids such as arginine can improve CRC and its complications. Hence, in this systematic review we evaluated the association between arginine intake and CRC improvement. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar databases by using proper keywords to find the relevant literatures, published to March 2019. Nine human studies of 523 screened articles were included in present systematic review. The majority of studies have found a positive association between consumption of arginine and CRC improvement. Increased inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and subsequently increasing the NO concentration in the tumor and/or serum, after arginine intake may be responsible for these protective effects. Also, arginine consumption may reduce cell proliferation in CRC and it can enhance immune function after remove the tumor. Although the benefits of arginine consumption in CRC patients were reported in previous trials, the finding need replication in well-designed studies before final conclusion. ",0
1373,1138163,Retrospective evidence favoring use of anticoagulants for myocardial infarctions,"During a state-wide retrospective study of myocardial infarction discharges from Maryland hospitals from July, 1966, through June, 1967, the relation of in-hospital case fatality rates to use of anticoagulants was examined in 1,156 patients. In patients who did not receive anticoagulants, the rate was 2.5 times that of those who did (p less than 0.0001). A large difference in case fatality rates between the anticoagulant and no-anticoagulant groups persisted when the data were analyzed by demographic and medical-care variables. When patients were classified according to clinical characteristics relating to prognosis, including arrhythmia, congestive heart failure and shock, the difference between the groups were also demonstrated. Although such a retrospective study cannot demonstrate conclusively the value of anticoagulant therapy, the data are sufficiently suggestive of a beneficial effect to warrant reopening the anticoagulant question.",0
1374,11207350,Genetic variation in alcohol dehydrogenase and the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on myocardial infarction,"BACKGROUND: A polymorphism in the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase type 3 (ADH3) alters the rate of alcohol metabolism. We investigated the relation among the ADH3 polymorphism, the level of alcohol consumption, and the risk of myocardial infarction in a nested case-control study based on data from the prospective Physicians' Health Study. METHODS: We identified 396 patients with eligible newly diagnosed cases of myocardial infarction among men in the Physicians' Health Study. Of these patients, 374 were matched with 2 randomly selected control subjects each and the remaining 22 with 1 control each (total, 770 controls). The ADH3 genotype (gamma1gamma1, gamma1gamma2, or gamma2gamma2) was determined in all subjects. We examined the relations among the level of alcohol intake, the ADH3 genotype, and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in this study population and in a similar cohort of women. RESULTS: As compared with homozygosity for the allele associated with a fast rate of ethanol oxidation (gamma1), homozygosity for the allele associated with a slow rate of ethanol oxidation (gamma2) was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.99). Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in all three genotype groups (gamma1gamma1, gamma1gamma2, and gamma2gamma2); however, the ADH3 genotype significantly modified this association (P=0.01 for the interaction). Among men who were homozygous for the gamma1 allele, those who consumed at least one drink per day had a relative risk of myocardial infarction of 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.13), as compared with the risk among men who consumed less than one drink per week. Men who consumed at least one drink per day and were homozygous for the gamma2 allele had the greatest reduction in risk (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.45). Such men also had the highest plasma HDL levels (P for interaction = 0.05). We confirmed the interaction among the ADH3 genotype, the level of alcohol consumption, and the HDL level in an independent study of postmenopausal women (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate drinkers who are homozygous for the slow-oxidizing ADH3 allele have higher HDL levels and a substantially decreased risk of myocardial infarction.",0

We performed a prospective randomized trial to determine whether renal transplant recipients with a positive CMV serostatus (R+) had a higher rate of CMV infection and disease after transplantation when treated preemptively for CMV infection, compared with primary valganciclovir prophylaxis. METHODS: Prophylaxis was 2 x 450 mg oral valganciclovir/day for 100 days; preemptive patients were monitored by CMV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and after a positive PCR test received 2 x 900 mg valganciclovir/day for at least 14 days followed by secondary prophylaxis. Valganciclovir dosage was adjusted according to renal function. Patients are followed up for 5 years and initial 12-month data are presented. Two hundred and ninety-six recipients were analyzed (168 donor/recipient seropositive [D+/R+], 128 donor seronegative/recipient seropositive [D-/R+]; 146 receiving prophylaxis and 150 preemptive therapy). RESULTS: Overall, CMV infection (asymptomatic CMV viral load >/= 400 CMV DNA copies/mL proven by CMV-PCR) was significantly higher in recipients under preemptive therapy (38.7% vs. 11.0%, P<0.0001), with the highest incidence in D+/R+ preemptive patients (53.8% vs. 15.6%, P<0.0001). D+/R+ recipients with preemptive therapy also had the highest rate of CMV disease (CMV syndrome and tissue-invasive disease that was clinically diagnosed and biopsy proven) (19.2% vs. 4.4%, P=0.003). Renal function assessed by creatinine clearance was similar for both groups. Graft loss occurred in 7 vs. 4 patients on preemptive versus prophylactic therapy (P>0.05). Tolerability was similar for both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral valganciclovir prophylaxis significantly reduces CMV infection and disease, particularly for D+/R+ patients. Hence, our study supports routine prophylaxis for all D+/R+ recipients.""",1
1378,19296759,Efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide,"In at least 50% of patients with hypertension, particularly those with stage 2 hypertension, combination drug therapy is required to achieve the currently recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. It is likely that future hypertension guidelines will recommend lowering BP beyond the currently recommended systolic/diastolic BP goals of lower than 140/90 mmHg for all patients with hypertension and lower than 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. In a series of clinical trials, the combination of olmesartan medoxomil, a well-established angiotensin receptor blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, has produced greater reductions in systolic BP and diastolic BP and greater proportions of patients achieving BP goals than monotherapy with either component. Additionally, the increased efficacy resulting from the combination with hydrochlorothiazide does not appear to significantly affect the tolerability profile of olmesartan medoxomil. This article provides a comprehensive evaluation of the chemistry, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of this combination and discusses its role in the management of hypertension.",1
1379,20491750,The effects of paracetamol (acetaminophen) on hepatic tests in patients who chronically abuse alcohol - a randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Retrospective accounts suggest that therapeutic doses of paracetamol can produce severe hepatic injury in patients with putative high-risk conditions, including alcoholism and infectious hepatitis. Metabolism of paracetamol to its hepatotoxic metabolite is enhanced in patients who abuse alcohol, who also have compromised liver defences from depressed hepatic glutathione. AIM: To determine the effect of paracetamol on serum liver tests of newly abstinent subjects who abuse alcohol, including subjects with hepatitis C infection. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adult alcohol abusers with a current drinking episode longer than 7 days received either placebo or paracetamol 4 g/day for 5 days. RESULTS: Of 142 subjects enrolled, 74 received paracetamol and 68 received placebo. Mean ALT activity during treatment increased from 48 to 62 IU/L in the paracetamol group and from 47 to 49 IU/L in the placebo group. Maximum ALT was 238 and 249 IU/L in the paracetamol and control groups respectively. The INR remained unchanged and serum bilirubin decreased in both groups. Subgroup analyses for subjects with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis C virus antibody and other subgroups showed no statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of paracetamol 4 g/day appears safe in newly abstinent patients who abuse alcohol.",1

Diabetes is present in patients with chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this case-control study is to assess the efficacy and safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with chronic liver disease caused by HCV. METHODS: ? Sixteen HCV positive patients with T2DM treated by sitagliptin were retrospectively enrolled. These patients were given sitagliptin between December 2009 and January 2010. Another 16 HCV patients with T2DM treated only with diet and excise for 48?weeks were selected as the control group. Serum levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured before and 12, 24, 36 and 48?weeks after the initiation of treatment. RESULTS: ? In the sitagliptin group, the average HbA1C level decreased approximately 0.8% at 48?weeks after the initiation of sitagliptin. Next, the average FPG level decreased approximately 20?mg/dL during follow up after the initiation of sitagliptin. All the patients were able to take sitagliptin of 50?mg/day without reduction because of sitagliptin-related side-effects. On the other hand, in the control group, the average HbA1C and FPG level did not change with statistical significance during follow up of 48?weeks. Regarding aminotransferase, there were no significant changes of average AST and ALT level during follow up of 48?weeks in both the sitagliptin group and control group. CONCLUSION: ? Our results indicate that sitagliptin is effective and safe for the treatment of T2DM complicated with HCV positive chronic liver disease.",1
1381,6373549,Long-term co-cultures of adult human hepatocytes with rat liver epithelial cells: modulation of albumin secretion and accumulation of extracellular material,"High yields of viable human hepatocytes were obtained by enzymatic perfusion of the left hepatic lobe of kidney donors and cultured alone or with an epithelial cell line derived from rat liver. In conventional cultures, human hepatocytes did not survive more than 2 to 3 weeks and by Day 8 decreased their ability to secrete albumin. When co-cultured, they survived for more than 2 months and secreted high levels of albumin even in a serum-free medium. This long-term survival appeared to correlate with production of an extracellular material which is rich in Type III collagen. In vitro phenotypic alterations of parenchymal cells were reversed by addition of rat liver cells and were characterized by recovery of cuboidal morphology, increased albumin secretion and a shift from Type I to Type III collagen deposition. Rat liver epithelial cells could not be replaced by nonhepatic epithelial cells. These observations suggest that when adult human hepatocytes are maintained in a culture which closely resembles their in vivo environment, they are capable of continuing to actively express specific cell functions.",0

1383,12921251,Acetaminophen intoxication and length of treatment: how long is long enough?,"The currently recommended dosing scheme for treating acetaminophen overdose in the United States consists of a loading dose of oral N-acetylcysteine 140 mg/kg, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses, for a total of 72 hours of oral N-acetylcysteine therapy. This protocol has been both effective and safe. We critically evaluated the evidence that supports reducing the course of N-acetylcysteine therapy from 72 hours to 24 or 36 hours. This shorter regimen offers important benefits for both the patient and the patient's family, such as increased drug tolerability and reduced hospital stay. Patients who intentionally ingested acetaminophen with harmful intent could receive appropriate psychosocial treatment more quickly. In addition, shorter courses of N-acetylcysteine therapy have positive financial ramifications by reducing the hospital stay by 1 or 2 days. Clearly, a shorter treatment regimen would not be appropriate for all patients, particularly those who seek treatment late (> 24 hrs after ingestion) and those with evidence of organ toxicity. In order to provide the necessary evidence to support a change in accepted clinical practice, further investigation on the safety and efficacy of a shorter N-acetylcysteine regimen should be conducted by clinical researchers in a controlled manner.",1
1384,6690939,Medical students trained abroad and medical manpower. Recent trends and predictions,"Physicians trained in foreign medical schools, including U.S. citizens, are once again playing a larger part in the provision of medical are in this country. After a decrease in the numbers of such physicians from 1977 through 1980, the number of foreign nationals entering the National Resident Matching Program increased by 312 per cent, and the number of U.S. citizens from foreign schools increased by 273 per cent. U.S. graduates of foreign medical schools participating in Fifth Pathway programs appear to benefit from their extra year of clinical training by being more successful in the National Resident Matching Program and having a higher pass rate on state licensing examinations. These increases in physicians trained in foreign medical schools, together with an increasing number of students graduating from U.S. medical schools, have resulted in an insufficient total number of first-year postgraduate positions, regardless of the specialty, to accommodate all physicians seeking a first-year residency. Since the number of residency positions will probably not expand to meet applicant demand, an increase in the pool of physicians with neither residency training nor licenses to practice medicine is likely. Alien foreign medical-school graduates and U.S. students who go abroad to study medicine can no longer take for granted residency training and practice in the United Stages.",0

We conducted a phase 2 trial of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). METHODS: We enrolled 449 heavily pretreated patients who had CML or Ph-positive ALL with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib or who had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Ponatinib was administered at an initial dose of 45 mg once daily. The median follow-up was 15 months. RESULTS: Among 267 patients with chronic-phase CML, 56% had a major cytogenetic response (51% of patients with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib and 70% of patients with the T315I mutation), 46% had a complete cytogenetic response (40% and 66% in the two subgroups, respectively), and 34% had a major molecular response (27% and 56% in the two subgroups, respectively). Responses were observed regardless of the baseline BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status and were durable; the estimated rate of a sustained major cytogenetic response of at least 12 months was 91%. No single BCR-ABL mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib was detected. Among 83 patients with accelerated-phase CML, 55% had a major hematologic response and 39% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 62 patients with blast-phase CML, 31% had a major hematologic response and 23% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 32 patients with Ph-positive ALL, 41% had a major hematologic response and 47% had a major cytogenetic response. Common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (in 37% of patients), rash (in 34%), dry skin (in 32%), and abdominal pain (in 22%). Serious arterial thrombotic events were observed in 9% of patients; these events were considered to be treatment-related in 3%. A total of 12% of patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib had significant antileukemic activity across categories of disease stage and mutation status.

1386,23485521,Cholesteryl ester storage disease: review of the findings in 135 reported patients with an underdiagnosed disease,"""Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is caused by deficient lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity, predominantly resulting in cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation, particularly in the liver, spleen, and macrophages throughout the body. The disease is characterized by microvesicular steatosis leading to liver failure, accelerated atherosclerosis and premature demise. Although CESD is rare, it is likely that many patients are unrecognized or misdiagnosed. Here, the findings in 135 CESD patients described in the literature are reviewed. Diagnoses were based on liver biopsies, LAL deficiency and/or LAL gene (LIPA) mutations. Hepatomegaly was present in 99.3% of patients; 74% also had splenomegaly. When reported, most patients had elevated serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and transaminases (AST, ALT, or both), while HDL-cholesterol was decreased. All 112 liver biopsied patients had the characteristic pathology, which is progressive, and includes microvesicular steatosis, which leads to fibrosis, micronodular cirrhosis, and ultimately to liver failure. Pathognomonic birefringent CE crystals or their remnant clefts were observed in hepatic cells. Extrahepatic manifestations included portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Liver failure in 17 reported patients resulted in liver transplantation and/or death. Genotyping identified 31 LIPA mutations in 55 patients; 61% of mutations were the common exon 8 splice-junction mutation (E8SJM(-1G>A)), for which 18 patients were homozygous. Genotype/phenotype correlations were limited; however, E8SJM(-1G>A) homozygotes typically had early-onset, slowly progressive disease. Supportive treatment included cholestyramine, statins, and, ultimately, liver transplantation. Recombinant LAL replacement was shown to be effective in animal models, and recently, a phase I/II clinical trial demonstrated its safety and indicated its potential metabolic efficacy.""",1
1387,23812464,Denosumab compared with ibandronate in postmenopausal women previously treated with bisphosphonate therapy: a randomized open-label trial,"""OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of denosumab to ibandronate in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (BMD) previously treated with a bisphosphonate. METHODS: In a randomized, open-label study, postmenopausal women received 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months (n=417) or 150 mg ibandronate orally every month (n=416) for 12 months. End points included percentage change from baseline in total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMD at month 12 and percentage change from baseline in serum C-telopeptide at months 1 and 6 in a substudy. RESULTS: At month 12, significantly greater BMD gains from baseline were observed with denosumab compared with ibandronate at the total hip (2.3% compared with 1.1%), femoral neck (1.7% compared with 0.7%), and lumbar spine (4.1% compared with 2.0%; treatment difference P<.001 at all sites). At month 1, median change in serum C-telopeptide from baseline was -81.1% with denosumab and -35.0% with ibandronate (P<.001); the treatment difference remained significant at month 6 (P<.001). Adverse events occurred in 245 (59.6%) denosumab-treated women and 230 (56.1%) ibandronate-treated women (P=.635). The incidence of serious adverse events was 9.5% for denosumab-treated women and 5.4% for ibandronate-treated women (P=.046). No clustering of events in any organ system accounted for the preponderance of these reports. The incidence rates of serious adverse events involving infection and malignancy were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women previously treated with a bisphosphonate and low BMD, denosumab treatment resulted in greater BMD increases than ibandronate at all measured sites. No new safety risks with denosumab treatment were identified.""",1
1388,1097926,Demonstration of an intrathymic defect in a case of severe combined immunodeficiency disease,"An in vitro system has been developed to elucidate the nature of the cellular defect in primary immunodeficiency diseases. Incubation, on human thymic epithelial monolayer cultures, of peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone-marrow cells from a child with documented severe combined immunodeficiency disease resulted in the appearance of a population of cells that formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. The same cell preparation permitted the synthesis of antigen-specific, complement-dependent antibodies after in vitro education, as demonstrated in a plaque assay system. In addition, thymic tissue from the same child gave morphologic and functional evidence of maturation when cultured in vitro. The experimental results suggest that in this case, lymphoid precursor cells were present in the bone marrow but failed to differentiate to functional maturity due to a defect in maturation of thymic tissue.",0
1389,18328264,Analysis of the GAD65-GAD65 autoantibody interaction,"GAD(65)Ab are important markers of risk of development of type 1 DM. With the need to improve the disease specificity of GAD(65)Ab measurement in mind, we have analysed the interaction between recombinant human GAD(65) and GAD(65)Ab from different groups of subjects in terms of association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium constants. In addition, binding of GAD(65)Ab from various groups of subjects to wild-type GAD(65) versus GAD(65) containing a mutation E517P was studied. Affinity constants for serum GAD(65)Ab in 12 type 1 DM patients ranged from 0.9 x 10(10) L/mol to 11.2 x 10(10) L/mol and from 0.8 x 10(10) L/mol to 14.0 x 10(10) L/mol in sera from 11 individuals without type 1 DM. Serum GAD(65)Ab concentrations assessed by Scatchard analysis ranged from 0.04 to 24.8 microg/mL in type 1 DM patients (n=12) and from 0.04 to 141.8 microg/mL in individuals without type 1 DM (n=11). Overall, our study indicated that GAD(65)Ab in different patients studied showed similar association and dissociation rate constants and similar affinity constants. However, GAD(65)Ab concentrations vary widely between different sera. There was a modest reduction of the median binding of GAD(65)Ab to GAD(65) E517P in the group of patients with type 1 DM compared to patients without type 1 DM. ",0
1390,16183826,Age-related changes in twitch properties of plantar flexor muscles in prepubertal children,"The twitch of the triceps surae muscle (TS), which characterizes the contractile properties independently of volition, differs in amplitude, but not in time course, when evoked in pre or postpubertal children. The aim of the present study was to compare the TS twitch contractile properties in prepubertal children (7 to 11 y). M-wave and twitch were recorded at rest by supramaximal electrical stimulations of the posterior tibial nerve. Twitches were characterized by peak torque (Pt), contraction time (CT), half relaxation time (HRT), and rate of torque development (dPt/dt). Electromechanical delay (EMD) was quantified with regard to the TS M-wave onset. Pt values increased significantly with the age of the prepubertal children but remained lower than that for adult subjects. CT and HRT values did not change with age. Thus, dPt/dt increased significantly between the 7-year-old and the 11-year-old children but remained significantly lower than that for adults. Despite EMD values decreased with age, they remained significantly higher than those of adult subjects. These results confirmed the link between growth processes and the increase in twitch torque for prepubertal children within a limited range of age. However, the time-course characteristics were not affected by age. The increase in dPt/dt and the decrease in the EMD could be used as indirect indicators of changes in contractile kinetics and in musculo-tendinous stiffness with the age of the prepubertal children. The age-related relationships established by this study will serve as reference values for clinical testing of the TS performances in relation to muscle disease or disuse. ",0
1391,11826415,Fine specificity of autoantibodies to soluble liver antigen and liver/pancreas,"Autoantibodies to soluble liver antigen and liver pancreas (SLA/LP) have been described as specific markers for Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH), occurring in about 20% of patients with AIH. The high degree of specificity for SLA/LP in autoimmune liver disease suggests a possible role in its pathogenesis. This study aims to map the exact epitope(s) recognized by SLA/LP autoantibodies and to assess the role of molecular mimicry between microbial antigens and self-epitopes. Using SLA/LP-reactive sera of 18 individual AIH patients and a pool of 15 patient sera, we found the dominant immune reactivity directed to peptide p395-414 and a less prominent immune response to 2 other epitopes adjacent to the dominant epitope. Immunodominance of peptide p395-414 was confirmed by absorption experiments. The SLA/LP autoantibodies of all tested AIH patients were mainly of the IgG1 type, suggesting that SLA/LP autoantibodies may arise by a common and specific underlying immune stimulus. Based on sequence homologies of the SLA/LP antigenic region with viral proteins, it was hypothesized that molecular mimicry may drive autoimmunity to SLA/LP. However, the homologous virus-derived peptides were not recognized by SLA/LP autoantibodies. Similarly, the only known procaryotic homologue, MJ0610 of Methanococcus jannaschii, was only weakly recognized by SLA/LP-positive sera. Thus, no evidence could be found for molecular mimicry being the causative mechanism for the development of SLA/LP autoantibodies. In conclusion, the exquisite epitope specificity and IgG subtype are evidence for the maturity of the SLA/LP autoantibody response; a specific autoantigen-driven process underlying the immunopathogenesis is likely.",0
1392,24661191,Liver injury possibly related to drug interaction after liver transplant: a case report,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is potentially lethal. Liver transplant patients receive a large number of medications and adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions must be closely monitored. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 29-year-old liver transplant patient who suffered liver injury most likely induced by drug interaction between capecitabine and warfarin. Vitamin K1 caused skin rash possibly because of the distribution and metabolism characteristic of the drug in this patient. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Close monitoring and prompt discontinuation of the drugs with high volume of distribution and metabolized through the liver are necessary to avoid drug-drug interaction in liver transplant patients.",1
1393,25688062,Patient radiation doses in various fluoroscopically guided orthopaedic procedures,"All orthopaedic fluoroscopic procedures performed using C-arm guidance were monitored for 1 y. The type of procedure, fluoroscopy time (T), kerma-area product (KAP) values and number of radiographs (F) were recorded. The two most often performed techniques were as follows: intramedullary nailing (IMN) of intertrochanteric/peritrochanteric (IP) fractures (101 cases, 49.3 %) and antergrade IMN of femur or tibia shaft (TS) fractures (28 cases, 13.7 %). For the remaining procedures, none accounted for >5 %, categorised as 'various' (76 cases, 37 %). Large variations in T, KAP and F were observed. For IMN of IP fractures, antergrade IMN of femur and TS fractures and for various procedures, respectively, median values were T--2.1, 2.2 and 0.6 min, KAP--6.3, 6.3 and 0.6 Gy cm(-2) and F--21, 2.2 and 6.7. The patient doses during fluoroscopically guided procedures are relatively low compared with other interventional procedures. ",0
1394,25682022,Effect of ivacaftor in patients with advanced cystic fibrosis and a G551D-CFTR mutation: Safety and efficacy in an expanded access program in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor is the first therapeutic agent approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) that targets the underlying molecular defect. Patients with severe lung disease were excluded from the randomized Phase 3 trials. This open-label study was designed to provide ivacaftor to patients in critical medical need prior to commercial product availability. METHODS: CF patients aged ?6 years with a G551D-CFTR mutation and FEV1 ? 40% predicted or listed for lung transplant received ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 h. The primary endpoint was safety as determined by adverse events. Secondary endpoints included assessment of lung function and weight. RESULTS: The rate of serious adverse events was consistent with disease severity. At 24 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor, there was a mean absolute increase in percent predicted FEV1 of 5.5 percentage points and a 3.3 kg mean absolute increase in weight from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe lung disease, ivacaftor was well tolerated and was associated with improved lung function and weight gain.",1
1395,28093797,Adverse reactions to dietary supplements containing red yeast rice: assessment of cases from the Italian surveillance system,"AIMS: Red yeast rice (RYR) is contained in dietary supplements for patients with dyslipidemia. RYR supplements contain monacolin K, which is chemically identical to lovastatin, a licensed drug with a well-known risk profile. We aim to describe the safety profile of RYR by analysing spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions (ARs). METHODS: Within the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health Products, suspected ARs were collected and evaluated by a multidisciplinary group of experts to assess causality using the WHO-UMC system or the CIOMS/RUCAM score, for hepatic reactions. The public version of the WHO-Vigibase was also queried. RESULTS: From April 2002 to September 2015, out of 1261 total reports, 52 reports concerning 55 ARs to RYR dietary supplements were collected. ARs consisted in myalgia and/or increase in creatine phosphokinase (19), rhabdomyolysis (1), liver injury (10), gastrointestinal reactions (12), cutaneous reactions (9) and other reactions (4). Women were involved in 70% of cases. In 13 cases, the reaction required hospitalization, and 28 patients were taking other medications. Dechallenge was positive in 40 reactions (73%), rechallenge was positive in 7. Causality resulted as certain (1), probable (31, 56%), possible (18, 34%), unlikely (3) or unassessable (2). Similar distribution emerged from the WHO-Vigibase. CONCLUSIONS: The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR is similar to that of statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions.",1
1396,17975090,Uncultivated Tannerella BU045 and BU063 are slim segmented filamentous rods of high prevalence but low abundance in inflammatory disease-associated dental plaques,"Uncultivated clones BU045 and BU063 and Tannerella forsythia, a 'consensus periodontal pathogen', are the closest known relatives within the genus Tannerella. They have been described to inhabit different ecological niches of the human oral cavity. In this study, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence were combined to investigate the prevalence and abundance of BU045 and BU063 in comparison to T. forsythia in plaques from gingivitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) and chronic periodontitis. Phylotype-specific FISH probes identified BU045 and BU063 as elongated thin rods with a segmented structure. Two structurally similar and previously unknown, rare phylotypes (127+ and 997+) were also identified due to partial 16S rRNA sequence identity with T. forsythia. In gingivitis, NUG and periodontitis patients, BU045, BU063, 127+, 997+ and T. forsythia were detected with prevalences of 50/83/71/14 and 81%, 100/100/86/17 and 53%, and 100/100/12/0 and 100%, respectively. Supragingivally, colonization density of all five organisms was generally low, rarely exceeding 0.1% of the total biota. In periodontal pocket samples, however, cell numbers of T. forsythia, but not of the uncultivable phylotypes, were greatly elevated. Our data demonstrate that Tannerella phylotypes BU045, BU063, 127+ and 997+ consist of long slim rods with segments, which, with respect to FISH stainability, often behaved as independent units. The phylotypes are frequent but low-level colonizers of various periodontal disease-associated plaques. Their apparent inability to proliferate to high density seems to exclude any relevance for the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. ",0
1397,8847499,The ATP-binding and ATPase activities of human papillomavirus type 16 E1 are significantly weakened by the absence of prolines in its ATP-binding domain,"The E1 protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the only known papillomavirus E1 which does not contain any proline residues in the phosphate-loop (P-loop) of its ATP-binding site. To ascertain whether this feature influences the activities of HPV-16 E1, we generated a mutant HPV-16 E1 (E1Pro) in which prolines are inserted in place of alanines in this site, making the P-loop identical to its bovine papillomavirus type 1 counterpart. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GSTE1wt and GSTE1Pro) were produced, purified and used to assay for ATP-binding ability, ATPase activity and ability to complex with the HPV-16 E2 protein. The results show that the lack of prolines in the P-loop, which is unique to HPV-16 E1, significantly weakens its ATP-binding and ATPase activities without affecting its ability to complex with the HPV-16 E2 protein.

1398,18344107,Are recommended doses of acetaminophen hepatotoxic for recently abstinent alcoholics? A randomized trial,"""Although acetaminophen overdose is a leading cause of fulminant hepatic failure, it is controversial whether therapeutic doses of acetaminophen can cause hepatotoxicity in alcoholics, especially those rendered most vulnerable by recent abstinence. We performed a randomized, triple-blind, parallel-group trial comparing sustained-release acetaminophen, 1300 mg orally q8h for 11 doses, against placebo. We enrolled chronic alcohol abusers (defined as >or= 6 drinks daily for >or= 6 weeks) who had discontinued alcohol consumption 12 to 72 hours prior to enrollment. Individuals with self-reported viral hepatitis, HIV or intravenous drug use, baseline AST or ALT >120 IU/L, or INR >1.5 were excluded. Hepatic function tests were drawn daily for 5 days. The primary outcome was change in serum alpha-GST, a sensitive experimental biomarker of hepatocellular injury; secondary outcomes were changes in serum AST, ALT, INR, and study withdrawal for a doubling of aminotransferases to >120 IU/L. Of 52 subjects randomized, 40 completed at least four days of intervention. Subjects receiving acetaminophen had 32% [95% CI 7%, 50%] and 29% [6%, 46%] lower serum alpha-GST concentrations on days 2 and 3, respectively, compared to placebo, but these differences disappeared by day 4. No subjects were withdrawn for safety reasons. In conclusion, therapeutic doses of sustained-release acetaminophen cause a measurable decrease in serum alpha-GST during the first days of abstinence from chronic alcohol use. While the mechanism is unclear, these observations do provide some reassurance that short courses of acetaminophen are unlikely to cause subclinical hepatocellular injury in recently abstinent alcoholics.""",1

This is one article in a series that systematically reviews the evidence for commonly used herbs during pregnancy and lactation. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature for evidence on the use, safety, and pharmacology of black cohosh focusing on issues pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. METHODS: We searched 7 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. RESULTS: Black cohosh, alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs as """"mother's cordial"""", has a long traditional use and is frequently used by midwives as a uterine stimulant and labour-inducing aid. Low-level evidence based on theory and expert opinion shows the following concerns with respect to black cohosh use during pregnancy: 1) labour-inducing effects, 2) hormonal effects, 3) emmenagogue properties and, 4) anovulatory effects. During lactation, there is low-level evidence from theoretical and expert opinion of black cohosh having hormonal properties. CONCLUSIONS: Black cohosh should be used with caution during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester where its purported labour-inducing effects could be of concern, and during lactation. Black cohosh should undergo rigorous high quality human studies to determine its safety in pregnancy and lactation.""",1
1400,25708022,"A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of the efficacy and safety of droxidopa in patients with intradialytic hypotension","""INTRODUCTION: Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is the most common complication of hemodialysis (HD), and it plays a significant role in the morbidity and mortality associated with maintenance HD. METHODS: This was a placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating efficacy and safety of droxidopa in improving intradialytic blood pressure (BP) responses in 85 adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and prone to IDH. Following screening and baseline periods, patients received 400 mg or 600 mg droxidopa, or placebo, orally 1 hour before HD for 4 weeks. Primary outcome endpoint was the change between baseline and last 2 treatment weeks in average mean arterial pressure (MAP) during HD. Also assessed were changes from baseline in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) during and after HD; number of hypotension-induced interventions and symptoms; and adverse events. RESULTS: Increase in droxidopa intra-HD MAP were not significantly different from placebo, although droxidopa groups showed significant improvements in mean SBP after HD of +4.8 ? 11.6 mm Hg (600-mg) and +3.4 ? 13.1 (400-mg) compared with -4.4 ? 17.9 mm Hg in placebo, and the drop seen in mean nadir SBP pre- to intra-HD was also reduced. Changes in mean DBP pre- and post-HD, changes in mean nadir SBP post-HD, or intra-HD SBP were not significant over the treatment period. HD terminations decreased 5-fold in the 600-mg group and 2-fold in the 400-mg group, whereas the number of discontinuations stayed unchanged in the placebo group. Overall, treatment with 600-mg or 400-mg droxidopa was well tolerated in this population. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that droxidopa may have a role in reducing IDH complications in patients with ESRD on chronic HD.""",1
1401,2664512,Bone marrow transplantation after the Chernobyl nuclear accident,"On April 26, 1986, an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Soviet Union exposed about 200 people to large doses of total-body radiation. Thirteen persons exposed to estimated total-body doses of 5.6 to 13.4 Gy received bone marrow transplants. Two transplant recipients, who received estimated doses of radiation of 5.6 and 8.7 Gy, are alive more than three years after the accident. The others died of various causes, including burns (the cause of death in five), interstitial pneumonitis (three), graft-versus-host disease (two), and acute renal failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (one). There was hematopoietic (granulocytic) recovery in nine transplant recipients who could be evaluated, six of whom had transient partial engraftment before the recovery of their own marrow. Graft-versus-host disease was diagnosed clinically in four persons and suspected in two others. Although the recovery of endogenous hematopoiesis may occur after exposure to radiation doses of 5.6 to 13.4 Gy, we do not know whether it is more likely after the transient engraftment of transplanted stem cells. Because large doses of radiation affect multiple systems, bone marrow recovery does not necessarily ensure survival. Furthermore, the risk of graft-versus-host disease must be considered when the benefits of this treatment are being weighed.",0

On the other hand, oral administration at the dose of approximately 35 mg/kg body weight for 30 weeks scarcely suppressed antibody preduction to heterologous RBC and cell-mediated immune response to Walker-256 carcinosarcoma in Wistar rats during the experimental period of 55 weeks. The daily administration by way of oral route proved to be efficient for the induction of stomach cancer. The difference in immunosuppressive effect of MNNG by these two routes will be discussed in relation to the susceptibility of in vivo degradation of the carcinogen. ",0
1403,19719703,Exenatide efficacy and safety: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy, effectiveness and side effects of exenatide when compared with oral glucose-lowering agents or insulin therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant citations were identified from searches of multiple bibliographic databases supplemented with searches of the US Food and Drug Administration website and other sources. A qualitative synthesis was performed, with a random effects meta-analysis when appropriate. RESULTS: We identified 17 studies. In placebo-controlled trials of subjects with poorly controlled diabetes (with both groups receiving various oral glucose-lowering agents), exenatide 10 microg twice daily improved glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) by approximately 1.0% over 30 weeks [pooled estimate -0.97%, 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.16 to -0.79%, P < 0.0001] and exenatide treatment over 16-30 weeks was associated with weight loss of 1.0-2.5 kg. Exenatide appeared to confer a similar benefit to various insulin regimes for glycaemic control at follow-up between 16 and 52 weeks (pooled estimate HbA(1c)-0.04%, 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.06%, P = 0.41), but was advantageous over insulin with respect to weight loss (3-6 kg loss at up to 52 weeks of follow-up). Nausea was the most common adverse event in placebo- and active-controlled trials. Rates of hypoglycaemia were similar in exenatide and insulin groups, but were higher with exenatide 10 microg twice daily compared with placebo and hypoglycaemia was most frequent when a sulphonylurea was administered. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with poorly controlled diabetes, exenatide was associated with a reduction in HbA(1c) that was similar to introducing another oral agent or insulin. Weight loss may be an advantage with exenatide. Long-term studies in diverse and unselected populations are needed to clarify the benefit vs. harm profile of this drug.",1

We conducted a phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with TET to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Patients with histologically confirmed TET whose disease progressed after at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if they had an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past year or documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease. Patients received 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of response rate was assessed every 9 weeks by investigators. Of 33 patients enrolled, 26 had thymic carcinoma and seven had thymoma. Of seven thymoma, two (28.6%; 95% CI, 8.2% to 64.1%) had partial response, and five (71.6%) had stable disease. Of 26 thymic carcinoma, five (19.2%; 95% CI, 8.5% to 37.9%) had partial response and 14 (53.8%) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 6.1 months for both groups. The most common adverse events of any grade included dyspnea (11; 33.3%), chest wall pain (10; 30.3%), anorexia (seven; 21.2%), and fatigue (seven; 21.2%). Five (71.4%) of seven patients with thymoma and four (15.4%) of 26 patients with thymic carcinoma reported grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse events, including hepatitis (four; 12.1%), myocarditis (three; 9.1%), myasthenia gravis (two; 6.1%), thyroiditis (one; 3.0%), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (one; 3.0%), colitis (one; 3.0%), and subacute myoclonus (one; 3.0%). Pembrolizumab showed encouraging antitumor activity in patients with advanced TET. Given the high incidence of autoimmunity, additional studies are needed to identify those who can benefit from pembrolizumab without immune-related adverse events. ",0
1406,11513735,Ubiquitination is essential for human cytomegalovirus US11-mediated dislocation of MHC class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol,"Human cytomegalovirus encodes two glycoproteins, US2 and US11, which cause rapid degradation of MHC class I molecules, thus preventing recognition of virus-infected cells by the immune system. This degradation process involves retrograde transport or 'dislocation' of MHC class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, where they are deglycosylated by an N-glycanase and degraded by the proteasome. At present it is unknown whether ubiquitination is required for US2- and US11-mediated dislocation and degradation of MHC class I molecules. Here, we show that in E36ts20 hamster cells, which contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, US11-mediated degradation of MHC class I molecules is strongly impaired at the non-permissive temperature, indicating the necessity for ubiquitination in this process. We next addressed the question of whether ubiquitination is a condition for the retrograde movement of MHC class I molecules from the ER to the cytosol, or whether ubiquitination is merely required for recognition of dislocated MHC class I molecules by the proteasome. In the absence of a functional ubiquitin system, complexes of US11 and MHC class I molecules accumulate in the ER. In this state the membrane topology of MHC class I molecules does not significantly change, as judged from proteinase K digestions. Thus the results indicate that a functional ubiquitin system is essential for dislocation of MHC class I molecules from the ER to the cytosol. ",0

At that time the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was only 82 U/L. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune markers were all negative. This hepatitis resolved quickly after cyproterone therapy was discontinued. One and a half years later, the patient was prescribed cyproterone 100 mg daily at another hospital where staff were unaware of his previous history. General malaise, upper abdominal pain and jaundice developed two months later. Laboratory studies at emergency room revealed an AST of 245 U/L, ALT of 255 U/L, total bilirubin of 8.2 mg/dL, amylase of 6055 U/L, prothrombin time of 15.2/11.1 seconds and platelet count of 68000 cells/mL. Although cyproterone was discontinued, the patient died of multiple organ failure 20 days after admission. This case report presents a rare situation with marked elevation of the ALT level without AST level elevation.

Cognitive deficits have been reported in patients with HF. A total of 148 systolic and diastolic HF patients (mean age 64 ± 11 years; 16% female; mean left ventricular ejection fraction 43 ± 8%) were extensively evaluated within 2 days by cardiological, neurological, and neuropsychological testing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 288 healthy, sex- and age-matched subjects sampled from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study served as MRI controls. Deficits in reaction times were apparent in 41% of patients and deficits in verbal memory in 46%. On brain MRI, patients showed more advanced medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) (Scheltens score) compared to controls (2.1 ± 0.9 vs. 1.0 ± 0.6; p < 0.001). The degree of MTA was strongly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment, whereas the extent of white matter hyperintensities was similar in patients and controls. Moreover, patients had a 2.7-fold increased risk for presence of clinically silent lacunes. HF patients exhibit cognitive deficits in the domains of attention and memory. MTA but not white matter lesion load seems to be related to cognitive impairment. ",0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fourteen women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly. RESULTS: The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2% to 34.4%), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression were 48% and 7%, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. Seventeen (57%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51%) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25% of patients), asthenia (23%), fever (22%), pain (18%), and nausea (14%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events. CONCLUSION: Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 3+ overexpression by IHC or gene amplification by FISH.""",1

The development of more effective agents to manage patients with AF is essential. While clinical trials show no major differences in outcomes between rate and rhythm control strategies, some patients with AF require treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) to maintain sinus rhythm, reduce symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, and improve quality of life. Currently available AADs, while effective, have limitations including limited efficacy, adverse events, toxicity, and proarrhythmic potential. The 6 most commonly used AADs (amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide [USA but not Europe], flecainide, propafenone, sotalol) have proarrhythmic effects (fewer with amiodarone). Amiodarone is the most effective AAD, but its safety profile limits its usefulness. Recent advances in AAD therapy include dronedarone and vernakalant. Dronedarone, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Authority and others, has been proven efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm and reducing the incidence of hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death in patients with AF. The intravenous formulation of vernakalant is approved in the European Union, Iceland, and Norway. Oral vernakalant is currently undergoing evaluation for preventing AF recurrence and appears to be effective with an acceptable safety profile. Treatment should be individualized to the patient with consideration of pharmacologic risks and benefits according to AF management guidelines. Accumulating efficacy and safety data for new and emerging AADs holds promise for improved AF management and outcomes.",1
1415,24720932,Dabrafenib for the treatment of melanoma,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous melanoma have an activating mutation in BRAF kinase, leading to constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and unregulated cell growth. Selective inhibitors of the mutated BRAF kinase produce response rates of approximately 50% with median progression-free survival of 6 - 7 months. BRAF-blocking therapies work rapidly, with responses seen within 2 weeks after therapy initiation, and they are associated with generally mild toxicities. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes as well as clinical efficacy and safety of dabrafenib for treatment of patients with advanced melanoma including unresectable stage IIIc and stage IV patients who harbor a BRAF V600 mutation. Clinical trial data are reviewed, and efficacy of dabrafenib in patients with brain metastases and in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Despite rapid and significant tumor reduction in a majority of patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma who are treated with dabrafenib, this drug's use as a single agent is limited because of its relatively short duration of response. Various combinations with drug(s) inhibiting other target kinases and/or with immunomodulating agent(s) will likely be the standard in the near future.",1

METHODS: This phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included the following: a 12-week treatment phase, with patients receiving placebo, apremilast 20 mg twice per day, or apremilast 40 mg once per day; a 12-week treatment-extension phase, with patients in the placebo group re-randomized to receive apremilast; and a 4-week observational phase after treatment cessation. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement (ACR20) at week 12. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory parameters, and electrocardiograms. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients with PsA who were randomized to a treatment group, 165 completed the treatment phase. At the end of the treatment phase (week 12), 43.5% of patients receiving apremilast 20 mg twice per day (P < 0.001) and 35.8% of those receiving 40 mg once per day (P = 0.002) achieved an ACR20 response, compared with 11.8% of those receiving placebo. At the end of the treatment-extension phase (week 24), >40% of patients in each group (patients receiving apremilast 20 mg twice per day, patients receiving apremilast 40 mg once per day, and patients in the placebo group re-randomized to receive apremilast) achieved the ACR20 level of improvement. Most patients in the treatment phase (84.3%) and treatment-extension phase (68.3%) reported ? 1 AE. Diarrhea, headache, nausea, fatigue, and nasopharyngitis were reported most frequently; most events were mild or moderate. No clinically relevant laboratory or electrocardiographic abnormalities were reported. CONCLUSION: Treatment with apremilast at a dosage of 20 mg twice per day or 40 mg once per day demonstrated efficacy in comparison with placebo and was generally well tolerated in patients with active PsA. The balance of efficacy, tolerability, and safety supports further study of apremilast in PsA.""",1

They are involved in host defense mechanisms and have a regulatory role in many biomedical processes. Their selective depletion, using liposome-encapsulated drugs, forms a widely accepted approach to studying their functional aspects in vivo. We have compared the Kupffer cell-depleting activities of liposome-encapsulated clodronate, propamidine, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for this purpose. These molecules represent the drug families of bisphosphonates, diamidines (or aromatic polyamidines), and polyaminopolycarboxylic acid-chelating agents, respectively. The Kupffer cell-depleting activity of the liposome-encapsulated antimicrobial drug propamidine exceeded that of clodronate by about a factor of 10. EDTA appeared to be inefficacious for depletion of Kupffer cells in the rat.",0
1418,25705303,Intellectual disability and epilepsy in down syndrome,"Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, with a reported frequency of epilepsy between 1.4-17% (1). There is a paucity of data in the literature regarding epilepsy in Down syndrome and its relation to intellectual disability. The purpose of this article is to analyze the association of epilepsy in children with DS - frequency and type of seizures, treatment, outcome and to compare cognitive impairment of children with DS and epilepsy and DS without epilepsy from our cohort. A four years systematic retrospective analysis of the database of the Pediatric Neurology Clinic (January 2010 - December 2013) identified a cohort of 39 pediatric cases with DS and neurological symptoms, 9 of them (23%) associating epileptic seizures. Following data were analysed: clinical and neurological examination, type/s of seizures, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), psychological examination, psychiatric evaluation in selected cases, electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac ultrasonography, ophthalmologic examination. 23% (9 patients) of the children with DS of our cohort presented epilepsy. Five patients had epileptic spasms (56%), one of these further developed astatic seizures. Focal seizures were observed in three patients (33%) and absence with eyelid myoclonias in one patient (11%). Two of the nine patients with DS and epilepsy had generalized seizures, both with very good response to levetiracetam (LEV). EEG was abnormal at seizure onset, and was improved after treatment. Of the nine children with DS and epilepsy, two (22%) presented mild mental retardation and seven (78%) had moderate to severe cognitive delay. Of the 30 children with DS and without epilepsy, 21 (70%) had mild mental retardation and 9 (30%) had moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The most frequent epileptic syndrome associated with DS is West syndrome, with good response to specific antiepileptics. All children with DS from our cohort have intelectual disability, more severe in those with epilepsy. Slight improvement of intelectual and language capabilities were seen after seizures control. ",0
1419,23532963,Mutual interaction between YAP and CREB promotes tumorigenesis in liver cancer,"Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream effecter of the Hippo-signaling pathway as well as cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), has been linked to hepatocarcinogenesis. However, little is known about whether and how YAP and CREB interact with each other. In this study, we found that YAP-CREB interaction is critical for liver cancer cell survival and maintenance of transformative phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, both CREB and YAP proteins are highly expressed in a subset of human liver cancer samples and are closely correlated. Mechanistically, CREB promotes YAP transcriptional output through binding to -608/-439, a novel region from the YAP promoter. By contrast, YAP promotes protein stabilization of CREB through interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38) and beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of CREB by MAPK14/p38 at ser133 ultimately leads to its degradation. Such effects can be enhanced by BTRC through phosphorylation of MAPK14/p38 at Thr180/Tyr182. However, YAP negatively controls phosphorylation of MAPK14/p38 through inhibition of BTRC expression. CONCLUSION: There is a novel positive autoregulatory feedback loop underlying the interaction between YAP and CREB in liver cancer, suggesting that YAP and CREB form a nexus to integrate the protein kinase A, Hippo/YAP, and MAPK14/p38 pathways in cancer cells and thus may be helpful in the development of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies against liver cancer.",0
1420,8800186,Risks of parenteral deferoxamine for acute iron poisoning,"OBJECTIVE: To review the adverse effects and risks of deferoxamine for the treatment of iron poisoning. METHODS: A literature search of deferoxamine induced adverse effects was used to identify pertinent articles. The references of these articles served as the source of other references not previously identified. RESULTS: Deferoxamine is a relatively safe antidote for iron intoxication, but adverse effects have been recognized with increased usage, particularly with prolonged intravenous dosing. This paper focuses on deferoxamine induced cardiovascular, pulmonary, ocular and auditory toxicity as well as its potential to increase the risk of infection. Information on iron's toxicology and toxicokinetics and deferoxamine's pharmacology and pharmacokinetics are reviewed. With this background information a hypothesis is generated to maximize deferoxamine benefit while minimizing deferoxamine induced pulmonary toxicity. The hypothesis is based upon a stoichiometric approach to maximal chelation during the first 24 h following iron ingestion. CONCLUSION: Deferoxamine is a relatively safe antidote for iron poisoning but the potential for pulmonary and cardiovascular toxicity should be respected. Studies defining maximum regimens over defined periods of time will allow a more logical utilization of deferoxamine, optimizing benefit and minimizing risk.",1
1421,10421668,Quasispecies of hepatitis C virus in serum and in three different parts of the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been known to infect hosts as a quasispecies. Several reports have shown this using serum samples, but there is little information about quasispecies in the liver. In this study, we evaluated quasispecies in serum and in 3 different parts of the liver in 8 patients with varying severity of chronic hepatitis C by calculating nucleotide diversity, entropy, type of substitution and by phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide diversity of HCV was different in each sample and ranged from 0.37% +/- 0.31% to 4.10% +/- 1.06%. However, the degree of HCV diversity in serum correlated with that in the liver in each patient (P <.01). Common HCV clones were found both in serum and liver samples in all 6 noncirrhotic patients, but all serum clones were different from the clones from the 2 cirrhotic livers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the degree of genetic diversity of HCV among the 3 liver samples was significantly high in the 4 patients with fibrosis. These genetic compartmentalizations of HCV did not depend on the type of substitution or the viral load of each liver sample. HCV quasispecies within the liver may be closely related to the viral life cycle and the pathogenesis of persistent infection of HCV.",0
1422,7906387,Loss of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene in parathyroid carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: The origin and molecular pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma are unknown. This life-threatening cause of primary hyperparathyroidism cannot be reliably distinguished from its benign counterpart on the basis of histopathological features alone. Because the PRAD1, or cyclin D1, gene, a cell-cycle regulator, has been implicated in a subgroup of benign parathyroid tumors, we examined the possibility that another cell-cycle regulator with possible functional links to PRAD1, the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (RB), might be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma. METHODS: Parathyroid carcinomas from 9 patients and adenomas from 21 were studied for evidence of tumor-specific loss of RB gene DNA (allelic loss) by analysis of four DNA polymorphisms and for evidence of altered expression oF RB protein by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: All of 11 specimens from 5 patients with parathyroid carcinoma and informative DNA patterns and 1 of 19 specimens from 19 patients with parathyroid adenoma and informative DNA patterns lacked an RB allele. Fourteen of 16 specimens (88 percent) from the nine patients with carcinoma had abnormal expression of RB protein (a complete or predominant absence of nuclear staining for the protein). None of the 19 adenomas, including the tumor with loss of an RB allele, had unequivocally abnormal staining for RB protein. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the RB gene is common in parathyroid carcinoma and is likely to be an important contributor to its molecular pathogenesis. The presence of such inactivation may help to distinguish benign from malignant parathyroid disease and may have useful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.",0
1423,3356406,"Elevation of acetylpolyamine levels in mouse tissues, serum and urine after treatment with radical-producing drugs and lipopolysaccharide","Polyamines and acetylpolyamines were analyzed in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, serum and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography on a column of cation-exchange resin after administering various cytotoxic substances to male mice. All of the compounds tested more or less affected the tissue levels of polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, spermine and acetylpolyamines (N1-acetylspermidine and N1-acetylspermine). It was found that they were classified into two groups of substances: one group (including radical-producing drugs and lipopolysaccharide) which elevated the tissue levels of N1-acetylspermidine, especially in the liver, while another group of drugs (such as D-galactosamine and DL-ethionine) had little effect on the acetylpolyamine levels. When the acetylpolyamine levels rose, the levels of spermidine and spermine declined, and then putrescine levels were elevated. N1-Acetylspermine was detected only when N1-acetylspermidine levels were very high after treatment with radical-producing drugs and lipopolysaccharide. Halogenated carbon, such as carbon tetrachloride and halothane, elevated the levels of acetylpolyamines especially in the liver, while paraquat elevated them in all tissues examined.",0
1424,10960445,Epidermal growth factor impairs the cytochrome C/caspase-3 apoptotic pathway induced by transforming growth factor beta in rat fetal hepatocytes via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathway,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-mediated apoptosis is one of the major death processes in the liver. We have previously shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important survival signal for TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in fetal hepatocytes (Fabregat et al., FEBS Lett 1996;384:14-18). In this work we have studied the intracellular signaling implicated in the protective effect of EGF. We show here that EGF activates p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). However, mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitors do not block the survival effect of EGF. EGF also activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) in these cells. The presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors blocks the protective effect of EGF on cell viability, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity. We have found that TGF-beta disrupts the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m))( )and activates the release of cytochrome c, this effect being blocked by EGF, via a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. A detailed study on bcl-2 superfamily gene expression shows that TGF-beta produces a decrease in the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of bcl-x(L), an antiapoptotic member of this family, capable of preventing cytochrome c release. EGF is able to maintain bcl-x(L) levels even in the presence of TGF-beta. PI 3-kinase inhibitors completely block the protective effect of EGF on TGF-beta-induced bcl-x(L )down-regulation. We conclude that PI 3-kinase mediates the survival effect of EGF on TGF-beta-induced death by acting upstream from the mitochondrial changes, i.e., preventing bcl-x(L) down-regulation, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-3.",0

Using in situ cytohybridization, we demonstrated EBV DNA in oropharyngeal epithelial cells from 10 of 12 patients with infectious mononucleosis. In duplicates of specimens found to contain cell-associated EBV DNA, we detected EBV RNA in two of four samples, using a biotin-labeled EBV DNA probe, thereby confirming the intracellular location of the viral genome. In 20 of 28 throat washings analyzed, cytohybridization results and assays for cell-free infectious virus were in agreement. In seven of the eight remaining specimens, cytohybridization identified intracellular EBV DNA in the absence of detectable extracellular virus. We conclude that the oropharyngeal epithelial cell may be the target cell type that is productively infected in infectious mononucleosis.",0
1426,402576,Foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis for health and medical practices,"Limits on health-care resources mandate that resource-allocation decisions be guided by considerations of cost in relation to expected benefits. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the ratio of net health-care costs to net health benefits provides an index by which priorities may be set. Quality-of-life concerns, including both adverse and beneficial effects of therapy, may be incorporated in the calculation of health benefits as adjustments to life expectancy. The timing of future benefits and costs may be accounted for by the appropriate use of discounting. Current decisions must inevitably be based on imperfect information, but sensitivity analysis can increase the level of confidence in some decisions while suggesting areas where further research may be valuable in guiding others. Analyses should be adaptable to the needs of various health-care decision makers, including planners, administrators and providers.",0

The MIST (Management of Influenza in the Southern Hemisphere Trialists) Study Group,"BACKGROUND: Influenza affects many people worldwide each year and has many troublesome symptoms. We investigated the efficacy and safety of the inhaled antiviral agent zanamivir as a treatment for influenza A and B infection. METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 455 patients aged 12 years and older with influenza-like symptoms of 36 h duration or less who lived in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 10 mg inhaled zanamivir (n=227) or placebo (n=228) twice daily for 5 days. All patients recorded symptoms on diary cards four times daily during treatment and twice daily for 9 days after treatment. We analysed all patients by intention to treat, influenza-positivity, and high risk of developing complications. FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, zanamavir relieved influenza symptoms a median of 1.5 days earlier in the intention-to-treat (p=0.011) and influenza-positive (p=0.004) populations, and 2 days earlier in patients who were febrile at entry [corrected]. In high-risk patients treated with zanamivir, symptoms were alleviated a median of 2.5 days earlier (p=0.048), fewer had complications (p=0.004), and fewer used complication-associated antibiotics (p=0.025) compared with placebo. The adverse event profiles were similar for zanamivir and placebo. INTERPRETATION: Zanamivir was well-tolerated and effective in decreasing the duration and severity of symptoms. Complications were also decreased in high-risk patients but these findings need to be confirmed in future studies due to the limited number of patients [corrected].",1

1431,7677232,Immune tolerance and protection against allergic sensitization,"Recent studies in our laboratory have focused on the nature of the primary T-cell response to inhaled allergens in the regional lymph nodes (RLN) draining the upper airways, in immunologically naive mice and rats. In general terms, the first detectable response involves activation of allergen-specific interleukin 4 (IL-4) secreting CD4+ Th-0/Th-2 cells, which triggers (at least in genetically high-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responders) an initial burst of IgE antibody synthesis. This is followed by a rapidly expanding interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) response in the RLN, which terminates IL-4 secretion and IgE production. We have presented evidence that the initial source of IFN-gamma in this response is a population of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted CD8+ T-cells, which respond specifically to the allergen. The initial activation of these CD8+ T-cells requires a source of exogenous IL-2, which appears to be supplied by the Th-0/Th-2 cells, which are themselves eventually suppressed by the cytokine products of the CD8+ T-cells. It is hypothesized that the IFN-gamma-rich milieu created by the allergen-specific CD8+ T-cells eventually selects for allergen-specific Th-1 cells, which, with chronic stimulation, eventually outgrow the CD8+ population and become dominant in the allergen-specific T-cell memory pool. Our most recent experiments have identified a previously covert but highly potent effector cell subset within the CD8+ T-cell population, in the form of allergen-specific TcR1 (gamma/delta) T-cells. Less than 500 of these cells, purified by positive sorting, are required to regulate the CD4 T-cell response in adult mice or rats, in adoptive transfer experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0
1432,22455413,Anti-interleukin-17 monoclonal antibody ixekizumab in chronic plaque psoriasis,"""BACKGROUND: Type 17 helper T cells have been suggested to play a pathological role in psoriasis. They secrete several proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-17A (also known as interleukin-17). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab (LY2439821), a humanized anti-interleukin-17 monoclonal antibody, for psoriasis treatment. METHODS: In our phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 142 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis to receive subcutaneous injections of 10, 25, 75, or 150 mg of ixekizumab or placebo at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with reduction in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI) score by at least 75% at 12 weeks. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with reduction in the PASI score by at least 90% or by 100%. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the percentage of patients with a reduction in the PASI score by at least 75% was significantly greater with ixekizumab (except with the lowest, 10-mg dose)--150 mg (82.1%), 75 mg (82.8%), and 25 mg (76.7%)--than with placebo (7.7%, P<0.001 for each comparison), as was the percentage of patients with a reduction in the PASI score by at least 90%: 150 mg (71.4%), 75 mg (58.6%), and 25 mg (50.0%) versus placebo (0%, P<0.001 for each comparison). Similarly, a 100% reduction in the PASI score was achieved in significantly more patients in the 150-mg group (39.3%) and the 75-mg group (37.9%) than in the placebo group (0%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Significant differences occurred at as early as 1 week and were sustained through 20 weeks. Adverse events occurred in 63% of patients in both the combined ixekizumab groups and in the placebo group. No serious adverse events or major cardiovascular events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a humanized anti-interleukin-17 monoclonal antibody, ixekizumab, improved the clinical symptoms of psoriasis. Further studies are needed to establish its long-term safety and efficacy in patients with psoriasis. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01107457.).""",1
1433,583367,Respiratory insufficiency in surgery],"""Acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) (reduced PaO2 and/or increased PaCO2) in surgical patients is mostly caused by atelectasis or bronchopneumonia. These complications may develop if functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced. Even in surgical patients with normal lungs the supine position, some pulmonary disorders after any general anaesthesia, pain, and atonic intestine cause reduced FRC in the postoperative phase. Successful prophylaxis is based on these mechanisms, which are described. The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, termed """"shock lung"""" a few years ago) is the most dangerous pulmonary complication leading to ARI. The evaluation of clinical data sugggests that noxious factors only active for a short time (so called """"triggers"""") may start the development of ARDS when some physiological conditions (so called """"constellations""""), such as low flow syndrome, reduced FRC and overhydration, pave the way for this. In the early state prognosis is good if the patient is ventilated (CPPV) and kept on the dry side, and if cardiac output is elevated compared to the normal value at rest. Once fully established, ARDS has such a poor prognosis that the need for earliest possible commencement of therapy must be stressed emphatically. The following values may be taken as clear and simple symptoms for early diagnosis: vital capacity below 15 ml/kg (reflects decreased FRC), PaO2 breathing spontaneously room air below 60 mm Hg or 8 kPa (reflects increased intrapulmonary right to left shunt or regional hypoventilation), and respiratory rate above 25/min (reflects loss of compliance).

1434,28395113,A novel role for CRTC2 in hepatic cholesterol synthesis through SREBP-2,"Cholesterol synthesis is regulated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and its target gene 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element (CRE) binding protein-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) 2 is the master regulator of glucose metabolism. However, the effect of CRTC2 on cholesterol and its potential molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CRTC2 expression and liver cholesterol content were increased in patients with high serum cholesterol levels who underwent resection of liver hemangiomas, as well as in mice fed a 4% cholesterol diet. Mice with adenovirus-mediated CRTC2 overexpression also showed elevated lipid levels in both serum and liver tissues. Intriguingly, hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis was markedly increased under these conditions. In contrast, CRTC2 ablation in mice fed a 4% cholesterol diet (18 weeks) showed decreased lipid levels in serum and liver tissues compared with those in littermate wild-type mice. The expression of lipogenic genes (SREBP-2 and HMGCR) was consistent with hepatic CRTC2 levels. In vivo imaging showed enhanced adenovirus-mediated HMGCR-luciferase activity in adenovirus-mediated CRTC2 mouse livers; however, the activity was attenuated after mutation of CRE or sterol regulatory element sequences in the HMGCR reporter construct. The effect of CRTC2 on HMGCR in mouse livers was alleviated upon SREBP-2 knockdown. CRTC2 modulated SREBP-2 transcription by CRE binding protein, which recognizes the half-site CRE sequence in the SREBP-2 promoter. CRTC2 reduced the nuclear protein expression of forkhead box O1 and subsequently increased SREBP-2 transcription by binding insulin response element 1, rather than insulin response element 2, in the SREBP-2 promoter. CONCLUSION: CRTC2 regulates the transcription of SREBP-2 by interfering with the recognition of insulin response element 1 in the SREBP-2 promoter by forkhead box O1, thus inducing SREBP-2/HMGCR signaling and subsequently facilitating hepatic cholesterol synthesis.

1435,20382058,"Phase 2 comparison of a novel ammonia scavenging agent with sodium phenylbutyrate in patients with urea cycle disorders: safety, pharmacokinetics and ammonia control","""Glycerol phenylbutyrate (glyceryl tri (4-phenylbutyrate)) (GPB) is being studied as an alternative to sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) for the treatment of urea cycle disorders (UCDs). This phase 2 study explored the hypothesis that GPB offers similar safety and ammonia control as NaPBA, which is currently approved as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of UCDs, and examined correlates of 24-h blood ammonia. METHODS: An open-label, fixed sequence switch-over study was conducted in adult UCD patients taking maintenance NaPBA. Blood ammonia and blood and urine metabolites were compared after 7 days (steady state) of TID dosing on either drug, both dosed to deliver the same amount of phenylbutyric acid (PBA). RESULTS: Ten subjects completed the study. Adverse events were comparable for the two drugs; 2 subjects experienced hyperammonemic events on NaPBA while none occurred on GPB. Ammonia values on GPB were approximately 30% lower than on NaPBA (time-normalized AUC=26.2 vs. 38.4 micromol/L; Cmax=56.3 vs. 79.1 micromol/L; not statistically significant), and GPB achieved non-inferiority to NaPBA with respect to ammonia (time-normalized AUC) by post hoc analysis. Systemic exposure (AUC(0-24)) to PBA on GPB was 27% lower than on NaPBA (540 vs. 739 microgh/mL), whereas exposure to phenylacetic acid (PAA) (575 vs. 596 microg h/mL) and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) (1098 vs. 1133 microg h/mL) were similar. Urinary PAGN excretion accounted for approximately 54% of PBA administered for both NaPBA and GPB; other metabolites accounted for <1%. Intact GPB was generally undetectable in blood and urine. Blood ammonia correlated strongly and inversely with urinary PAGN (r=-0.82; p<0.0001) but weakly or not at all with blood metabolite levels. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and ammonia control with GPB appear at least equal to NaPBA. Urinary PAGN, which is stoichiometrically related to nitrogen scavenging, may be a useful biomarker for both dose selection and adjustment for optimal control of venous ammonia.""",1
1436,3945267,Relation between complications of type I diabetes mellitus and collagen-linked fluorescence,"""Nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins gradually form fluorescent cross-linked protein adducts--a process termed """"browning."""" The rate of this reaction increases with the glucose concentration. Assaying for the presence of browning products in long-lived proteins should therefore provide information on long-term metabolic control. We measured collagen-linked fluorescence typical for nonenzymatic browning in skin-biopsy specimens from 41 subjects with longstanding Type I diabetes and from 25 controls. Fluorescence correlated with age and (weakly) with the duration of diabetes. Mean age-adjusted fluorescence values were twice as high in diabetic subjects as in control subjects (P less than 0.0001) and increased with the severity of retinopathy, nephropathy, and arterial and joint stiffness. The correlation was significant for retinopathy (r = 0.42; P less than 0.01), arterial stiffness (r = 0.41; P less than 0.01), joint stiffness (r = 0.34; P less than 0.05), and the sum of all complications (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01). Fluorescence also correlated with systolic (r = 0.42; P less than 0.01) and diastolic (r = 0.36; P less than 0.05) blood pressures. If one can assume that the fluorescence results from a browning product of glucose, our data suggest that there is an overall correlation between the severity of diabetic complications and cumulative glycemia over many years.""",0
1437,30744806,Defining host-pathogen interactions employing an artificial intelligence workflow,"For image-based infection biology, accurate unbiased quantification of host-pathogen interactions is essential, yet often performed manually or using limited enumeration employing simple image analysis algorithms based on image segmentation.

The first patient was a 60-year-old nun with recent onset of cramps and proximal weakness, mimicking an acquired myopathy. Muscle biopsy disclosed slight alterations in one sample and severe dystrophic changes in another; dystrophin was absent in 7% fibers in the former specimen and in 60% in the second. X inactivation was skewed with 90% cells inactivating the same X chromosome. The second patient was a 17-year-old girl with hyperCKemia, learning disability and a family history of X-linked muscular dystrophy. Muscle biopsy displayed slight fiber size variability and some internal nuclei; dystrophin was absent only in one muscle fiber. A second sample with the same morphological features demonstrated dystrophin deficiency with mosaic distribution. The pattern of X inactivation was normal. These cases emphasize the variability of histopathological changes and dystrophin deficiency in Xp21 muscular dystrophy carriers and the risk of sampling errors in muscle biopsy. ",0

BRAF inhibition has shown antitumour activity in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC. Dual MAPK pathway inhibition with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC might improve efficacy over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy based on observations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma. We aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC. METHODS: In this phase 2, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, we enrolled adult patients (aged ?18 years) with pretreated metastatic stage IV BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC who had documented tumour progression after at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy and had had no more than three previous systemic anticancer therapies. Patients with previous BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment were ineligible. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enrol only if the lesions were asymptomatic, untreated (or stable more than 3 weeks after local therapy if treated), and measured less than 1 cm. Enrolled patients received oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) in continuous 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, which was assessed by intention to treat in the protocol-defined population (patients who received second-line or later treatment); safety was also assessed in this population and was assessed at least once every 3 weeks, with adverse events, laboratory values, and vital signs graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634. FINDINGS: Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 14, 2015, 59 patients from 30 centres in nine countries across North America, Europe, and Asia met eligibility criteria. Two patients who had previously been untreated due to protocol deviation were excluded; thus, 57 eligible patients were enrolled. 36 patients (63?2% [95% CI 49?3-75?6]) achieved an investigator-assessed overall response. Serious adverse events were reported in 32 (56%) of 57 patients and included pyrexia in nine (16%), anaemia in three (5%), confusional state in two (4%), decreased appetite in two (4%), haemoptysis in two (4%), hypercalcaemia in two (4%), nausea in two (4%), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in two (4%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia in five patients (9%), hyponatraemia in four (7%), and anaemia in three (5%). Four patients died during the study from fatal adverse events judged to be unrelated to treatment (one retroperitoneal haemorrhage, one subarachnoid haemorrhage, one respiratory distress, and one from disease progression that was more severe than typical progression, as assessed by the investigator). INTERPRETATION: Dabrafenib plus trametinib could represent a new targeted therapy with robust antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.

Those who satisfied these criteria were termed """"valid"""" patients. Institutions were divided into two groups, """"major participants"""" and """"minor participants,"""" according to the number of patients they entered in the trial. In a detailed analysis of a multicenter trial of chemotherapy for soft-tissue sarcoma, we found that major participants had a significantly higher percentage of valid patients than did minor participants (81 per cent vs. 39 per cent) and that the minor participants were actually detrimental to the study from both scientific and administrative viewpoints. These results suggest that institutions should not participate in multicenter studies unless they can enter some predetermined minimal number of patients per year.""",0

Participants were screened for the presence of gallstones by gallbladder ultrasonography, completed a questionnaire on family and personal history and underwent a physical examination and blood chemistry. Statistically significant associations were established by univariate analysis of the age-standardized data and by step-wise multiple logistic regression. At univariate analysis, increasing age, serum triglycerides and number of cigarettes smoked per day, and decreasing high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were the conditions associated with the presence of gallstones in men. Age and parity were the correspondent associations in women. After controlling by multiple logistic regression, a different pattern of associated conditions emerged. In men, only age and serum triglycerides showed a significant positive association with gallstones, which was independent of other variables. In women, the presence of gallstones was independently associated with increasing age, number of pregnancies, body mass index and serum triglycerides, and with decreasing total (and low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. The latter association was curvilinear in shape. The conditions associated with a history of cholecystectomy differed from those observed in subjects with gallstones, with the exceptions of age, in both sexes, and high serum triglycerides, in women. Fasting blood glucose levels were higher in women with a history of cholecystectomy than in those with or without gallstones, both at univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
1447,26502771,Voriconazole-Induced Hepatitis via Simvastatin- and Lansoprazole-Mediated Drug Interactions: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,"Therapeutic voriconazole concentrations have a narrow window of effectiveness before causing cholestatic hepatitis. After undergoing 1 year of voriconazole therapy for pulmonary aspergillosis, a 44-year-old man began treatment with 30 mg lansoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Within 5 days of starting treatment with lansoprazole, the patient presented with fatigue, jaundice, and cholestatic hepatitis. The hepatitis promptly resolved after stopping lansoprazole treatment. Sixteen months later, the patient was given simvastatin therapy, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association to prevent cardiovascular disease for patients with diabetes who are aged >40 years and have one additional risk factor. Within 2 weeks of taking simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (statin) therapy, the patient redeveloped fatigue, jaundice, and cholestatic hepatitis. He described both episodes of fatigue and jaundice similarly in terms of onset and intensity. Voriconazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Lansoprazole is an inhibitor of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme. Competition between voriconazole and lansoprazole likely led to increased voriconazole serum concentration and acute cholestatic hepatitis in this patient. Simvastatin inhibits the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After the patient took 10 mg simvastatin daily for 2 weeks, cholestatic hepatitis occurred. The voriconazole concentration remained elevated (4.1 ?g/ml) when measured 15 days after stopping simvastatin. The patient's Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score of 7 revealed that the cholestatic hepatitis was probably precipitated by lansoprazole. Likewise, the patient's Naranjo score of 9 also revealed that cholestatic hepatitis was attributable to a definite adverse drug reaction precipitated by the addition of simvastatin to the stable baseline regimen of voriconazole. In a single patient, two different inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 pathway stimulated voriconazole-induced cholestatic hepatitis. Although the major cytochrome P450 pathways for the metabolism and clearance of lansoprazole and simvastatin are different, they both likely contributed to the reduced hepatic clearance of voriconazole in this patient.",1

METHODS: C-SALVAGE was a prospective open-label trial of grazoprevir 100 mg once daily and elbasvir 50 mg once daily coadministered with weight-based ribavirin twice daily for 12 weeks in genotype 1-infected cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients who had failed treatment with ? 4 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin plus either boceprevir, telaprevir, or simeprevir. Although the primary efficacy outcome was SVR12, patients were also evaluated 24 weeks after cessation of study therapy. Population sequencing was performed at baseline and periodically in virologic failures throughout the 24-week posttherapy follow-up period. RESULTS: SVR24 rates were 76 of 79 (96.2%) overall, with all 3 relapses occurring by posttherapy week 8. Every NS3 and NS5A variant detected at baseline reappeared at the time of relapse and persisted throughout the available follow-up period. NS3_A156T emerged in virus from each patient at relapse, but rapidly disappeared over the ensuing 2 weeks in 2 patients. NS5A_Y93H emerged in virus from 2 patients at relapse and persisted for the entire follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Grazoprevir and elbasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks maintained HCV suppression for at least 24 weeks posttherapy without late relapses. Baseline resistance-associated variants (RAVs) stably reappeared at relapse in all 3 patients with virologic failure. NS5A_RAVs emerging at relapse persisted for the full 24-week follow-up period. If confirmed, this finding could complicate retreatment of the small number of patients failing regimens containing an NS5A inhibitor. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02105454.",1

Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (LPO) has been implicated in the toxicology of pyrethroids. Fenugreek is known for its antitoxic and antioxidant potential. We have investigated the protective effect of aqueous extract of germinated fenugreek seeds in CM-induced hepatic and renal toxicity. Male Wistar rats were treated with 1/10 LD(50) (25 mg/kg body weight) of CM and 10% aqueous extract of fenugreek (GFaq) for 60 days. CM treatment caused increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), depletion in glutathione (GSH) and reduction in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in liver and kidneys. There was a significant reduction in total phospholipids and increased activities of phospholipases A (PLA) and C (PLC) in liver and kidneys and increased activities of serum marker enzymes, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine tansaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Treatment with 10% GFaq showed replenishment of antioxidant status and brought all the values to near normal, indicating the protective effect of fenugreek.

1451,17035649,A self-regulation program for maintenance of weight loss,"BACKGROUND: Since many successful dieters regain the weight they lose, programs that teach maintenance skills are needed. We developed a maintenance program based on self-regulation theory and tested the efficacy of delivering the program face to face or over the Internet. METHODS: We randomly assigned 314 participants who had lost a mean of 19.3 kg of body weight in the previous 2 years to one of three groups: a control group, which received quarterly newsletters (105 participants), a group that received face-to-face intervention (105), and a group that received Internet-based intervention (104). The content of the programs in the two intervention groups was the same, emphasizing daily self-weighing and self-regulation, as was the frequency of contact with the groups. The primary outcome was weight gain over a period of 18 months. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) weight gain was 2.5+/-6.7 kg in the face-to-face group, 4.7+/-8.6 kg in the Internet group, and 4.9+/-6.5 kg in the control group, with a significant difference between the face-to-face group and the control group (2.4 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.002 to 10.8; P=0.05). The proportion of participants who regained 2.3 kg or more over the 18-month period was significantly higher in the control group (72.4%) than in the face-to-face group (45.7%; absolute difference, 27%; 95% CI, 14 to 39; P<0.001) or the Internet group (54.8%; absolute difference, 18%; 95% CI, 5 to 30; P=0.008). Daily self-weighing increased in both intervention groups and was associated with a decreased risk of regaining 2.3 kg or more (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with receiving quarterly newsletters, a self-regulation program based on daily weighing improved maintenance of weight loss, particularly when delivered face to face.

One hundred forty-one loci formed 41 linkage groups. The total map size was 1,468 cM and the average size of linkage groups was 35.8 cM. The average distance between markers was 14.7 cM and the range was 0-37.2 cM. Early comparisons to the genetic maps of other taxa suggest appreciable synteny with buffelgrass ( Pennisetum spp.) and sorghum ( Sorghum spp.). One hundred ninty-one F(2) plants were used to analyze QTLs of flooding tolerance, plant morphology, heading date, number of leaves, and plant height. For flooding tolerance, two QTLs were detected and one was mapped on linkage group 24. Other traits, including plant morphology, heading date, number of leaves, and plant height were highly correlated. Three genomic regions accounted for most of the mapped QTLs, each explaining 2-4 of the significant marker-trait associations. The high observed correlation between the traits appears to result from QTLs with a large contribution to the phenotypic variance at the same or nearby locations. ",0

The G-->A mutation at nucleotide 1896 may mediate viral escape by creating a TAG stop codon in the precore region, thus preventing HBeAg production. This mutation frequently evolves during HBe seroconversion if thymine, but rarely if cytosine, is present in position 1858. Applying a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme action, we have studied the relation of the TAG mutation and the nucleotide (nt) 1858 variants to liver damage assessed by histology activity index (HAI) scoring in 175 chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. A TAG mutation was found in 68 of 71 (96%) of HBeAg-negative carriers infected with a T-1858 strain, but not in any of 33 carriers infected exclusively with a C-1858 strain. Four patients showed a mutation of the precore start codon, and 2 had a TAA stop mutation at codon 2. HBeAg-positive infection with a mixture of wild-type and TAG mutant virus indicated active liver damage, because 8 of 9 (89%) of such patients had a Knodell HAI greater than or equal to 8. In HBeAg-negative stage, both inflammation and fibrosis were more pronounced in carriers infected with wild-type HBV compared with precore mutants. C-1858 strains were associated with more inflammation and fibrosis compared with T-1858 strains. C-1858 strains were found in 71% of northern European, 17% of southern European, 31% of African, 2% of Middle Eastern, and 10% of Far Eastern carriers. Analysis of these variants and mutants may prove useful for clinical evaluation and choice of therapy, and may be facilitated by the methods described.",0

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to compare the efficacy and safety of desirudin (Revasc, CGP 39393; fifteen milligrams two times a day) with that of unfractionated heparin (5000 international units three times a day) in patients having a primary elective total hip replacement. The medications were administered subcutaneously, starting preoperatively and continuing for eight to eleven days. The primary end point was a confirmed thromboembolic event during the treatment period. The presence of deep-vein thrombosis was evaluated with bilateral venograms, which were centrally assessed by two independent radiologists. A total of 445 eligible patients were randomized: 220, to management with heparin, and 225, to management with desirudin. A per-protocol analysis of efficacy was performed for the 351 patients (79 per cent) for whom an adequate bilateral venogram had been made within eight to eleven days after the operation or who had had a proved thromboembolic event. The prevalence of confirmed deep-vein thrombosis was thirteen (7 per cent) of 174 patients who had received desirudin and forty-one (23 per cent) of 177 patients who had received heparin, a significant difference (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis was also significantly reduced (p < 0.0001), by 79 per cent, in the group that had received desirudin (six [3 per cent] of 174 patients) compared with in the group that had received heparin (twenty-nine [16 per cent] of 177). There were no confirmed pulmonary embolisms or deaths during the period of prophylaxis. During a six-week follow-up period, pulmonary embolism was confirmed in four patients, all of whom had received heparin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups with respect to bleeding variables or bleeding complications. These data demonstrate that a fixed dose of fifteen milligrams of desirudin, started preoperatively and administered subcutaneously twice daily for at least eight days, provided effective, safe prevention of thromboembolic complications, with no specific requirements for laboratory monitoring, in patients who had a total hip replacement.""",1
1457,9881118,Effects of couples' characteristics on contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa: the Ghanaian example,"Using data from the 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, this study examines couples' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in the context of their attitudes towards family planning, and the impact of these factors on the use of contraceptives. The characteristics of the husbands and their influence on wives' behaviour illustrate the role of intra-household relations between men and women and their effect on fertility-related behaviour in patriarchal African societies. Compared to elsewhere in the Third World, Africa has one of the lowest contraceptive use rates.  Recent studies suggest that gender relations in many parts of the continent may be responsible for such low use of modern contraception.  The 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey collected data on background characteristics, contraceptive knowledge and use, attitudes toward family planning, marriage, fertility, and fertility preferences from 4488 reproductive-age women and 1010 of their husbands.  Relative to their spouses, men tended to be older, better educated, and more likely working in agriculture.  83% of men and 73% of women indicated their acceptance of mass media family planning messages, while 20% of husbands and 16% of wives reported using some form of contraception.  A larger percentage of men and women over age 26 reported using contraception compared to respondents under age 26.  The level of contraception use increased with the level of education for both sexes, although the level of use was inversely related to the difference in age between spouses.  Periodic abstinence was the most widely used method, followed by oral contraception.  Communication between spouses was an important predictor of family planning use. ",0

GSK3β is also an important target for lithium and antidepressants. When phosphorylated at serine-9, GSK3β becomes inactive. Few studies evaluated serine-9 phosphorylated GSK3β (phospho-GSK3β) levels in BD subjects in vivo and no study has assessed it specifically in bipolar depression. Also, the effect of lithium monotherapy on GSK3β has never been studied in humans. In 27 patients with bipolar depression, total GSK3β and phospho-GSK3β were assessed in platelets by enzyme immunometric assay. Subjects were evaluated before and after 6 weeks of lithium treatment at therapeutic levels. Healthy subjects (n = 22) were used as a control group. No differences in phospho-GSK3β or total GSK3β were observed when comparing drug-free BD subjects in depression and healthy controls. Baseline HAM-D scores were not correlated with phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β levels. From baseline to endpoint, lithium treatment inactivated GSK3β by significantly increasing phospho-GSK3β levels (p = 0.010). Clinical improvement (baseline HAM-D - endpoint HAM-D) negatively correlated with the increase in phospho-GSK3β (p = 0.03). The present results show that lithium inactivates platelet GSK3β in BD during mood episodes. No direct association with pathophysiology of BD was observed. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of GSK3β as a key biomarker in BD and its association with treatment response as well as the relevance of GSK3β in other neuropsychiatric disorders and as a new therapeutic target per se.

Secondary exploratory data analysis of Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Oxygenation Randomised Trial (SUPPORT). Multiple referral neonatal intensive care units. 1316 infants 24 0/7 to 27 6/7 weeks gestation randomised to different oxygenation (SpO2 target 85-89% vs 91-95%) and ventilation strategies. Blood gases from postnatal day 0 to day14 were analysed. Five PaCO2 variables were defined: minimum (Min), maximum (Max), SD, average (time-weighted), and a four level categorical variable (hypercapnic (highest quartile of Max PaCO2), hypocapnic (lowest quartile of Min PaCO2), fluctuators (hypercapnia and hypocapnia), and normocapnic (middle two quartiles of Max and Min PaCO2)). PaCO2 variables were compared for infants with and without sIVH, BPD and NDI (±death). Multivariable logistic regression models were developed for adjusted results. sIVH, BPD and NDI (±death) were associated with hypercapnic infants and fluctuators. Association of Max PaCO2 and outcomes persisted after adjustment (per 10 mm Hg increase: sIVH/death: OR 1.27 (1.13 to 1.41); BPD/death: OR 1.27 (1.12 to 1.44); NDI/death: OR 1.23 (1.10 to 1.38), death: OR 1.27 (1.12 to 1.44), all p<0.001). No interaction was found between PaCO2 category and SpO2 treatment group for sIVH/death, NDI/death or death. Max PaCO2 was positively correlated with maximum FiO2 (rs0.55, p<0.0001) and ventilator days (rs0.61, p<0.0001). Higher PaCO2 was an independent predictor of sIVH/death, BPD/death and NDI/death. Further trials are needed to evaluate optimal PaCO2 targets for high-risk infants. ",0

1462,20409026,Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: An update,"""Isoniazid (INH) has been the mainstay of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection for almost 50 years. The currently recommended preferred regimen is 9 months daily self-administered INH (9H); this has efficacy of more than 90% if completed properly. Unfortunately, INH is associated with serious adverse events, including hepatotoxicity. Although risk factors for this complication are well established, allowing for better selection of candidates for therapy, this complication still occurs, and is occasionally fatal. Hence close follow up of patients is necessary, increasing the cost and complexity of treatment. This problem, plus the lengthy duration, results in poor acceptance by patients and providers, and poor adherence by patients. As a result, many preventable cases of tuberculosis continue to occur, and the public health impact of latent tuberculosis infection treatment is suboptimal. These problems have spurred interest in finding shorter, safer and cheaper alternative regimens, with similar efficacy. Of the many regimens that have been examined, 2 months of rifampin and pyrazinamide has excellent efficacy-in experimental studies in mice and randomized trials, largely in HIV-infected persons. However, while the safety of 2 months of rifampin and pyrazinamide appears acceptable in HIV-infected persons and children, in non-HIV-infected adults this regimen is associated with an unacceptably high rate of severe liver toxicity. Three to four months of INH and rifampin has had equivalent effectiveness as 6 months INH in several randomized trials. However, completion of therapy and toxicity has been the same as with INH-possibly because two drugs are taken rather than one. The fourth commonly studied regimen is 4 months rifampin. This has been found to have significantly better completion than 9H, with significantly less toxicity, especially hepatotoxicity. However, only one trial has evaluated efficacy and effectiveness of mono-rifampin therapy. In this trial, 3 months rifampin had somewhat better efficacy than either 3 months of isoniazid and rifampin (3HR) or 6 months isoniazid. Two large scale trials are ongoing; one is comparing efficacy and effectiveness of 9H with 4 months rifampin (both daily and self-administered), while the second, which is nearing completion, compares daily self-administered 9H with 3 months directly observed once weekly INH combined with rifapentine. The results of these two trials will likely shape future recommendations substantially.""",1
1463,15234643,Newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the risk of serious hepatic adverse events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"""BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cases of hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were being treated with leflunomide, one of the newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). We assessed the risk of hepatic events associated with the use of leflunomide and other DMARDs. METHODS: Two cohorts comprising 41,885 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had been dispensed a DMARD between September 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, were formed using claims databases. Follow-up was from the first dispensing date to the occurrence of a serious or nonserious hepatic event. A nested case-control approach was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of hepatic events associated with DMARDs dispensed during the prior year, as compared with methotrexate monotherapy. RESULTS: There were 25 cases of serious hepatic events (rate, 4.9 per 10,000 per year) and 411 nonserious hepatic events (rate, 80.0 per 10,000 per year). There was no increase in the rate of serious hepatic events with either leflunomide (rate ratio [RR] = 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 4.9) or traditional DMARDs (RR = 2.3; 95% CI: 0.8 to 6.5). However, the rate was increased with biologic DMARDs (RR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.2 to 24.6). The rate of nonserious hepatic events was also increased with biologic DMARDs (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3), but not with leflunomide (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.7 to 1.3) and traditional DMARDs (RR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an excess risk of serious or nonserious hepatic events with the use of leflunomide as compared with methotrexate. Still, the increased risk observed with the new biologic DMARDs should be investigated further.""",1
1464,17488146,Comparative review of the carbapenems,"""The carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad spectrum of activity. Older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) located in renal tubules and required co-administration with a DHP-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. Later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to DHP-1 and are administered without a DHP-1 inhibitor. Like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including AmpC beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Resistance to carbapenems develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their PBPs, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. Imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. As with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC). Imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. The current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. The unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. Doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa than meropenem. Clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including nosocomial infections.""",1
1465,9880357,Myo-inositol-dependent sodium uptake in ice plant ,"In salt-stressed ice plants (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), sodium accumulates to high concentrations in vacuoles, and polyols (myo-inositol, D-ononitol, and D-pinitol) accumulate in the cytosol. Polyol synthesis is regulated by NaCl and involves induction and repression of gene expression (D.E. Nelson, B. Shen, and H.J. Bohnert [1998] Plant Cell 10: 753-764). In the study reported here we found increased phloem transport of myo-inositol and reciprocal increased transport of sodium and inositol to leaves under stress. To determine the relationship between increased translocation and sodium uptake, we analyzed the effects of exogenous application of myo-inositol: The NaCl-inducible ice plant myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase is repressed in roots, and sodium uptake from root to shoot increases without stimulating growth. Sodium uptake and transport through the xylem was coupled to a 10-fold increase of myo-inositol and ononitol in the xylem. Seedlings of the ice plant are not salt-tolerant, and yet the addition of exogenous myo-inositol conferred upon them patterns of gene expression and polyol accumulation observed in mature, salt-tolerant plants. Sodium uptake and transport through the xylem was enhanced in the presence of myo-inositol. The results indicate an interdependence of sodium uptake and alterations in the distribution of myo-inositol. We hypothesize that myo-inositol could serve not only as a substrate for the production of compatible solutes but also as a leaf-to-root signal that promotes sodium uptake. ",0

A history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was significantly more common than expected among the fathers of men with a low HDL cholesterol level. We also found a relationship between AMI among fathers and high Apo AI level in sons, although this relationship was not as strong as that between AMI among fathers and low HDL cholesterol in sons. No significant relationship was found between AMI among mothers and HDL cholesterol or Apo AI in sons. ",0
1467,11893791,Prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance among children and adolescents with marked obesity,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity, epidemic in the United States, has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents. We determined the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in a multiethnic cohort of 167 obese children and adolescents. METHODS: All subjects underwent a two-hour oral glucose-tolerance test (1.75 g [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] of glucose per kilogram of body weight), and glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured. Fasting levels of proinsulin were obtained, and the ratio of proinsulin to insulin was calculated. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment, and beta-cell function was estimated by calculating the ratio between the changes in the insulin level and the glucose level during the first 30 minutes after the ingestion of glucose. RESULTS: Impaired glucose tolerance was detected in 25 percent of the 55 obese children (4 to 10 years of age) and 21 percent of the 112 obese adolescents (11 to 18 years of age); silent type 2 diabetes was identified in 4 percent of the obese adolescents. Insulin and C-peptide levels were markedly elevated after the glucose-tolerance test in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance but not in adolescents with diabetes, who had a reduced ratio of the 30-minute change in the insulin level to the 30-minute change in the glucose level. After the body-mass index had been controlled for, insulin resistance was greater in the affected cohort and was the best predictor of impaired glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired glucose tolerance is highly prevalent among children and adolescents with severe obesity, irrespective of ethnic group. Impaired oral glucose tolerance was associated with insulin resistance while beta-cell function was still relatively preserved. Overt type 2 diabetes was linked to beta-cell failure.",0

A particularly interesting example is flucloxacillin (FLUX)-DILI, which is associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele. At present, the mechanism of FLUX-DILI is not understood, but the HLA association suggests a role for activated T cells in the pathomechanism of liver damage. To understand the interaction among FLUX, HLA molecules, and T cells, we generated FLUX-reacting T cells from FLUX-naive HLA-B*57:01(+) and HLA-B*57:01(-) healthy donors and investigated the mechanism of T cell stimulation. We found that FLUX stimulates CD8(+) T cells in two distinct manners. On one hand, FLUX was stably presented on various HLA molecules, resistant to extensive washing and dependent on proteasomal processing, suggesting a hapten mechanism. On the other hand, in HLA-B*57:01(+) individuals, we observed a pharmacological interaction with immune receptors (p-i)-based T cell reactivity. FLUX was presented in a labile manner that was further characterized by independence of proteasomal processing and immediate T cell clone activation upon stimulation with FLUX in solution. This p-i-based T cell stimulation was restricted to the HLA-B*57:01 allele. We conclude that the presence of HLA-B*57:01 drives CD8(+) T cell responses to the penicillin-derivative FLUX toward nonhapten mechanism.",1

The purpose of the present study was to identify factors affecting the colonoscopy screening behaviour of FOBT-positive individuals, based on the health belief model (HBM). This study involved a cross-sectional survey of 213 individuals aged 50 years or older who underwent CRC screening at a general hospital in Seoul, Korea, as part of the Korean National Cancer Screening Programme and who tested positive on FOBT. The questionnaire was created based on HBM instruments. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and factors associated with adherence to colonoscopy were examined using logistic regression analysis. Of the FOBT-positive individuals, 44.1% adhered to colonoscopy. Three of the six evaluated HBM-driven factors (perceived seriousness, perceived barriers and health motivation) significantly differed between colonoscopy-adherent and non-adherent subjects. Perceived seriousness and perceived barriers were the most important factors influencing colonoscopy screening behaviour. For early detection and prevention of CRC, colonoscopy screening behaviour should improve among FOBT-positive individuals. To this aim, education on the graveness of CRC should be provided, and barriers to CRC screening should be addressed. ",0
1472,2170840,Somatostatin-receptor imaging in the localization of endocrine tumors,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: A number of different tumors have receptors for somatostatin. We evaluated the efficacy of scanning with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, for tumor localization in 42 patients with carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or paragangliomas. We then evaluated the response to octreotide therapy in some of these patients. RESULTS: Primary tumors or metastases, often previously unrecognized, were visualized in 12 of 13 patients with carcinoid tumors and in 7 of 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors. The endocrine symptoms of these patients responded well to therapy with octreotide. Among 20 patients with paragangliomas, 8 of whom had more than one tumor, 10 temporal (tympanic or jugular), 9 carotid, and 10 vagal tumors could be visualized. One small tympanic tumor and one small carotid tumor were not seen on the scan. CONCLUSIONS: The 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide scanning technique is a rapid and safe procedure for the visualization of some tumors with somatostatin receptors. A positive scan may predict the ability of octreotide therapy to control symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion.",0

1474,26200980,AVI-7288 for Marburg Virus in Nonhuman Primates and Humans,"BACKGROUND: AVI-7288 is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer with positive charges that targets the viral messenger RNA that encodes Marburg virus (MARV) nucleoprotein. Its safety in humans is undetermined. METHODS: We assessed the efficacy of AVI-7288 in a series of studies involving a lethal challenge with MARV in nonhuman primates. The safety of AVI-7288 was evaluated in a randomized, multiple-ascending-dose study in which 40 healthy humans (8 humans per dose group) received 14 once-daily infusions of AVI-7288 (1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, or 16 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo, in a 3:1 ratio. We estimated the protective dose in humans by comparing pharmacokinetic variables in infected nonhuman primates, uninfected nonhuman primates, and uninfected humans. RESULTS: Survival in infected nonhuman primates was dose-dependent, with survival rates of 0%, 30%, 59%, 87%, 100%, and 100% among monkeys treated with 0 mg, 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg of AVI-7288 per kilogram, respectively (P<0.001 with the use of the log-rank test for the comparison of survival across groups). No safety concern was identified at doses up to 16 mg per kilogram per day in humans. No serious adverse events were reported. Drug exposure (the area under the curve) was dose-dependent in both nonhuman primates and humans; drug clearance was independent of dose but was higher in nonhuman primates than in humans. The protective dose in humans was initially estimated, on the basis of exposure, to be 9.6 mg per kilogram per day (95% confidence interval, 6.6 to 12.5) for 14 days. Monte Carlo simulations supported a dose of 11 mg per kilogram per day to match the geometric mean protective exposure in nonhuman primates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, on the basis of efficacy in nonhuman primates and pharmacokinetic data in humans, AVI-7288 has potential as postexposure prophylaxis for MARV infection in humans.

1475,29195717,The efficacy of two different dosages of hepatitis B immunoglobulin combined with hepatitis B vaccine in preventing mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: A prospective cohort study,"A birth dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), in combination with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), is recommended for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers. However, the optimal dosage of HBIG remains to be resolved. This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the efficacy of two dosages of HBIG combined with HepB to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV. From 2009 to 2011, we prospectively enrolled mother-infant pairs with positive maternal HBsAg in China. Infants were assigned to receive one dose of 100 IU or 200 IU HBIG within 12 h of birth according to maternal numbering, followed by completion of the 3-dose 10 μg HepB series. At 7 months, post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) was performed in 545 and 632 infants in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups, respectively, among whom, 451 and 529 were followed up to 12 months. Maternal and birth characteristics were comparable between infants in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups. At 7 months, the rates of perinatal infection were 1.5% (8/545) and 1.9% (12/632) in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups, respectively (p = .568). One non-responder infant in 200 IU HBIG group became newly infected at 12 months. The antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive rates were 98.5% (529/537) and 98.2% (609/620) in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups at 7 months, respectively (p = .704), and the corresponding figures were 98.2% (431/439) and 97.1% (496/511) at 12 months (p = .266). The anti-HBs geometric mean concentrations were comparable between two groups at 7 months (707.95 mIU/mL vs. 602.56 mIU/mL, p = .062) and 12 months (245.47 mIU/mL vs. 229.09 mIU/mL, p = .407). One birth dose of 100 IU HBIG, combined with the HepB series, might be enough for preventing MTCT of HBV in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. ",0

This study tested the hypothesis that ezetimibe/simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent that inhibits both intestinal cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis, provides greater LDL-C reductions than atorvastatin across dose ranges. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, 6-week parallel-group study randomized 1902 patients with LDL-C above ATP III goal to atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg) or to ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg). Patients were stratified by prerandomization LDL-C level. RESULTS: At each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison, and averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin provided greater LDL-C reductions (47%-59%) than atorvastatin (36%-53%). Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 and 10/80 mg also provided significantly greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increases than atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg. Triglyceride reductions were similar for all comparisons. More ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents attained the ATP III LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL and the optional LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL. C-reactive protein reductions were similar between treatment groups. Consecutive elevations in alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase occurred in significantly more atorvastatin patients than ezetimibe/simvastatin patients. No myopathy or liver-related adverse events led to study discontinuation with either drug. CONCLUSIONS: Ezetimibe/simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C at each dose comparison and provided greater increases in HDL-C at the 40- and 80-mg statin dose. Ezetimibe/simvastatin is a highly efficacious, well-tolerated treatment option for hypercholesterolemic patients.",1

1479,1870640,Fetal fibronectin in cervical and vaginal secretions as a predictor of preterm delivery,"BACKGROUND: Preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, but efforts to address the problem are hampered by the inability to predict accurately which pregnancies are at risk. We postulated that damage to the fetal membranes may release fetal fibronectin into the cervix and vagina, giving rise to a biochemical marker for preterm delivery. METHODS: We measured fetal-fibronectin concentrations in cervical and vaginal secretions, amniotic fluid, and maternal plasma with a sensitive immunoassay using the monoclonal antibody FDC-6. Immunohistochemical studies were used to determine the distribution of fetal fibronectin in the placenta and amniochorionic membranes and to ascertain its cell of origin. RESULTS: Women with uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 163) who delivered at term rarely had cervicovaginal fetal-fibronectin concentrations above 0.05 micrograms per milliliter between 21 and 37 weeks of gestation (11 of 267 cervical samples [4 percent] and 9 of 267 vaginal samples [3 percent]. High levels of fetal fibronectin were detected in amniotic fluid and in the cervical or vaginal secretions of 93.8 percent of the women with preterm rupture of membranes (n = 65). Cervical or vaginal fetal fibronectin was also present in 50.4 percent of the women with preterm uterine contractions and intact membranes (n = 117), and its presence identified the women who delivered before term (n = 60) with a sensitivity of 81.7 percent and a specificity of 82.5 percent. In the placenta and membranes, fetal fibronectin was found at points of contact with the uterine wall. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy identifies a subgroup of women who are at high risk for preterm delivery. This phenomenon may reflect the separation of the chorion from the decidual layer of the uterus, with the release of intact or degraded chorionic components of the extracellular matrix into the cervical and vaginal secretions.",0

To serially evaluate the viral kinetics of occult hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients and perform a correlation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN. Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION.

1484,19916579,Benefit-risk assessment of leflunomide: an appraisal of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis 10 years after licensing,"Evidence is accumulating for the early sustained usage of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide was licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1998. Postmarketing surveillance, case reports and observational studies have highlighted less common or unexpected adverse events. Therefore, it is appropriate that we review the benefit-risk profile of leflunomide after 10 years of widespread usage. A wide-based search of relevant literature was performed to formulate this assessment. The improvements in rheumatoid arthritis shown by double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of leflunomide have now been shown to be maintained beyond 4 years in open-label extension studies. Leflunomide is comparable to methotrexate, but better than sulfasalazine at 24 months in only one study. However, tolerance in clinical practice research shows higher than expected withdrawal rates due to both toxicity and lack of efficacy when compared with methotrexate and placebo. Adverse events reported include gastrointestinal upset, hypertension, headache, hepatotoxicity and hair loss, as well as predisposition to infection and peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects for leflunomide is similar to sulfasalazine but higher than those seen with methotrexate. Serious drug-induced hepatotoxicity leading to hospitalization is rare (0.02%), but isolated fatalities from liver failure have been documented. It is considered likely, but not yet proven, that there may be an increased incidence of weight loss and interstitial lung disease with leflunomide. Leflunomide in combination with methotrexate or sulfasalazine is an effective regimen in RCTs utilizing placebo controls, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in combination with other DMARDs, particularly biologicals. The active metabolite of leflunomide is teratogenic in animal studies and is also found in breast milk. Therefore, contraception is advised in both males and females of child-bearing potential. There are genetic, pharmacokinetic and biochemical reasons to explain variation in both patient response and adverse event profile. Hence, blood and blood pressure monitoring are recommended and therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered in clinical nonresponders. Leflunomide is an effective DMARD that sustains a clinical and radiological response comparable to sulfasalazine and methotrexate. However, adverse effects necessitate frequent monitoring. It should be used with caution in those of child-bearing potential and with pre-existing lung and liver disease.",1

Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19, an antigen consistently expressed on B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. We aimed to confirm the activity and safety profile of blinatumomab for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study, we enrolled adult patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative, primary refractory or relapsed (first relapse within 12 months of first remission, relapse within 12 months after allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation [HSCT], or no response to or relapse after first salvage therapy or beyond) leukaemia. Patients received blinatumomab (9 ?g/day for the first 7 days and 28 ?g/day thereafter) by continuous intravenous infusion over 4 weeks every 6 weeks (up to five cycles), per protocol. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial haematological recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh) within the first two cycles. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466179. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, 189 patients were enrolled and treated with blinatumomab. After two cycles, 81 (43%, 95% CI 36-50) patients had achieved a CR or CRh: 63 (33%) patients had a CR and 18 (10%) patients had a CRh. 32 (40%) of patients who achieved CR/CRh underwent subsequent allogeneic HSCT. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile neutropenia (48 patients, 25%), neutropenia (30 patients, 16%), and anaemia (27 patients, 14%). Three (2%) patients had grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Neurologic events of worst grade 3 or 4 occurred in 20 (11%) and four (2%) patients, respectively. Three deaths (due to sepsis, Escherichia coli sepsis, and Candida infection) were thought to be treatment-related by the investigators. INTERPRETATION: Single-agent blinatumomab showed antileukaemia activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia characterised by negative prognostic factors. Further assessment of blinatumomab treatment earlier in the course of the disease and in combination with other treatment approaches is warranted. FUNDING: Amgen.",1

Tofacitinib is a novel, oral, Janus kinase inhibitor that treats RA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs. DESIGN: 1-year, double-blind, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00856544). SETTING: 114 centers in 19 countries. PATIENTS: 792 patients with active RA despite nonbiologic DMARD therapy. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned 4:4:1:1 to oral tofacitinib, 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, or placebo advanced to tofacitinib, 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. MEASUREMENTS: Primary end points were 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) criteria; Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-4[ESR]) of less than 2.6; DAS28-4(ESR)-defined remission, change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score, and safety assessments. RESULTS: Mean treatment differences for ACR20 response rates (month 6) for the 5-mg and 10-mg tofacitinib groups compared with the combined placebo groups were 21.2% (95% CI, 12.2% to 30.3%; P < 0.001) and 25.8% (CI, 16.8% to 34.8%; P < 0.001), respectively. The HAQ-DI scores (month 3) and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 response rates (month 6) were also superior in the tofacitinib groups versus placebo. The incidence rates of serious adverse events for patients receiving 5-mg tofacitinib, 10-mg tofacitinib, or placebo were 6.9, 7.3, or 10.9 events per 100 patient-years of exposure, respectively. In the tofacitinib groups, 2 cases of tuberculosis, 2 cases of other opportunistic infections, 3 cardiovascular events, and 4 deaths occurred. Neutrophil counts decreased, hemoglobin and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased, and serum creatinine levels had small increases in the tofacitinib groups. LIMITATIONS: Placebo groups were smaller and of shorter duration. Patients received primarily methotrexate. The ability to assess drug combinations other than tofacitinib plus methotrexate was limited.

1489,14500805,"The effects of parathyroid hormone, alendronate, or both in men with osteoporosis","""BACKGROUND: Because parathyroid hormone increases both bone formation and bone resorption, it is possible that combining parathyroid hormone with an antiresorptive agent will enhance its effect on bone mineral density. METHODS: We randomly assigned 83 men who were 46 to 85 years of age and had low bone density to receive alendronate (10 mg daily; 28 men), parathyroid hormone (40 microg subcutaneously daily; 27 men), or both (28 men). Alendronate therapy was given for 30 months; parathyroid hormone therapy was begun at month 6. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, radial shaft, and total body was measured every six months with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was measured at base line and month 30 by means of quantitative computed tomography. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were measured every six months. The primary end point was the rate of change in the bone mineral density at the posteroanterior spine. RESULTS: The bone mineral density at the lumbar spine increased significantly more in men treated with parathyroid hormone alone than in those in the other groups (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The bone mineral density at the femoral neck increased significantly more in the parathyroid hormone group than in the alendronate group (P<0.001) or the combination-therapy group (P=0.01). The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased significantly more in the combination-therapy group than in the alendronate group (P<0.001). At 12 months, changes in the serum alkaline phosphatase level were significantly greater in the parathyroid hormone group than in the alendronate group or the combination-therapy group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Alendronate impairs the ability of parathyroid hormone to increase the bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck in men. This effect may be attributable to an attenuation of parathyroid hormone-induced stimulation of bone formation by alendronate.""",1
1490,18410471,Fluvastatin inhibits hepatitis C replication in humans,"""UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is the leading cause of death due to liver disease in the United States. Currently, pegylated interferon and ribavirin produce sustained viral remission in only 50% of patients. Additional agents are needed to increase the cure rate. In vitro experiments show strong antiviral effects of fluvastatin against HCV. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and antiviral effects of fluvastatin in chronic HCV carriers. METHODS: 31 veterans with chronic HCV were prospectively given oral doses of fluvastatin, 20 to 320 mg/day, for 2-12 weeks with weekly monitoring of HCV RNA and liver tests. Reductions of viral load (P < 0.01) versus a control group were considered suppressive. RESULTS: With 80 mg a day or less, 11/22 (50%) patients responded by lowering HCV RNA. The first lowering occurred within 4 weeks (9/11, 82%). The greatest weekly change in HCV RNA level was a 1.75 log(10) reduction. When lowered in responders, the viral load remained relatively constant for 2-5 weeks (7/9, 78%), or on the next test rebounded immediately to a non-significant change from, baseline (n = 2). Continued lowering of virus was seen in 2/19 (22 %) patients when the study ended. We found no evidence of liver tests worsening. CONCLUSIONS: FLV used as monotherapy in vivo showed suppressive effects of HCV clinically that are modest, variable, and often short-lived. These findings support """"proof-of-concept"""" for pilot trials combining fluvastatin with standard therapy. Statins and fluvastatin, in particular, appear to be safe for use in hepatitis C.""",1

1494,29679386,Hepatitis B Virus Evasion From Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate-Adenosine Monophosphate Synthase Sensing in Human Hepatocytes,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and cancer worldwide. The mechanisms of viral genome sensing and the evasion of innate immune responses by HBV infection are still poorly understood. Recently, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) was identified as a DNA sensor. In this study, we investigated the functional role of cGAS in sensing HBV infection and elucidate the mechanisms of viral evasion. We performed functional studies including loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments combined with cGAS effector gene expression profiling in an infectious cell culture model, primary human hepatocytes, and HBV-infected human liver chimeric mice. Here, we show that cGAS is expressed in the human liver, primary human hepatocytes, and human liver chimeric mice. While naked relaxed-circular HBV DNA is sensed in a cGAS-dependent manner in hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes, host cell recognition of viral nucleic acids is abolished during HBV infection, suggesting escape from sensing, likely during packaging of the genome into the viral capsid. While the hepatocyte cGAS pathway is functionally active, as shown by reduction of viral covalently closed circular DNA levels in gain-of-function studies, HBV infection suppressed cGAS expression and function in cell culture models and humanized mice. Conclusion: HBV exploits multiple strategies to evade sensing and antiviral activity of cGAS and its effector pathways.",0

METHODS: Names of sex partners and needle-sharing partners and information on how to locate them were obtained from consenting HIV-infected subjects identified in the HIV-testing programs at three public health departments in North Carolina. The subjects were randomly assigned to a patient-referral group (in which patients had the initial responsibility for notifying their partners) or a provider-referral group (in which the study counselor notified the partners). The success of attempts to notify partners was monitored by means of interviews with counselors conducted both in the field and at the health department. RESULTS: Of 534 HIV-positive persons identified at the health departments, 247 (46 percent) did not return for counseling after the test, 8 were counseled outside the study, and 117 (22 percent) were ineligible. Of the 162 invited to participate, 88 (54 percent) declined and 74 (46 percent) agreed. The subjects were mostly male (69 percent), black (87 percent), homosexual or bisexual (76 percent of the men), and had a median age of 30 years. Thirty-nine were assigned to the provider-referral group and 35 to the patient-referral group. In the provider-referral group 78 of 157 partners (50 percent) were successfully notified, whereas in the patient-referral group only 10 of 153 (7 percent) were notified. Of the partners notified by the counselors, 94 percent were not aware that they had been exposed to HIV. Overall, 23 percent of the partners notified and tested were HIV-positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, leaving the notification of partners up to the subjects (patient referral) was quite ineffective, despite the North Carolina law requiring that partners be notified. Partner notification by public health counselors (provider referral) was significantly more effective. Although the effectiveness of notification procedures is constrained by the accuracy of the information provided by HIV-infected patients, counselors who notify the partners of an infected patient can refer them to educational, medical, and support services targeted to persons at high risk for HIV infection and may encourage the adoption of less risky behavior.""",0
1501,11726569,The effectiveness and safety of recombinant human LH to support follicular development induced by recombinant human FSH in WHO group I anovulation: evidence from a multicentre study in Spain,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), a urinary extract containing a fixed combination of LH and FSH, was the only source of exogenous LH for women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotrophins. Recombinant human LH (rLH) is now available for clinical use, providing a new treatment option but clinical data on its use are scanty. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of rLH combined with recombinant FSH (rFSH) to induce follicular development and ovulation in World Health Organization (WHO) group I anovulatory women. METHODS: We included in this multicentre study 38 hypogonadotrophic anovulatory (WHO group I) women. Patients received 150 IU/day rFSH and 75 IU/day rLH (with the possibility of dose adjustment) as a single s.c. injection for up to three cycles with a total of 84 treatment cycles. RESULTS: Sufficient follicular growth was observed in 79 (94%) out of 84 initiated cycles. The 75 IU rLH dose was found to be effective in most treatment cycles (94%) and only five cycles in three patients required daily dose increase. Overall, HCG was administered to trigger ovulation in 67 (80%) of the 84 cycles while it was withheld in 12 cycles (14%) due to ovarian hyper-response and five cycles (6%) were cancelled for insufficient follicular growth. The pregnancy rate per started treatment cycle and per cycle given HCG was 18 and 22.4% respectively. Pregnancy was achieved by 15 (39.5%) of the 38 patients. Mild to moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred in three patients. Local tolerance was good. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that combined rFSH and rLH treatment induces follicular growth, ovulation and pregnancy in a good proportion of hypogonadotrophic anovulatory patients and is well tolerated. The doses of 150 IU rFSH and 75 IU rLH daily seem the most appropriate but in a small minority of patients doses >75 IU rLH/day may be necessary.",1

Open cystolithotomy remains the preferred option for treating large or multiple stones. Increasingly, however, minimal access techniques have been used. Reports of Mitrofanoff cystolitholapaxy are rare and have been limited to adults. This study presented a two centre series of children treated by cystolitholapaxy via the Mitrofanoff/Monti channel. With institutional approval the current study retrospectively reviewed and identified 14 patients, on a prospective database, who underwent Mitrofanoff cystolitholapaxy to treat bladder calculi at two independent institutions in the UK and Chile between 2004 and 2016. It looked at patient demographics, surgical technique, stone clearance and recurrence, as well as leak or catheterisation difficulties of the Mitrofanoff/Monti channel post-procedure. Fourteen patients underwent Mitrofanoff cystolitholapaxy during the period 2004-2016. One patient was excluded due to lack of follow-up. The remaining 13 patients were aged 5-22 (median 14) years at the time of the procedure. Their underlying diagnoses were four neuropathic bladders, four bladder exstrophy, four cloacal exstrophy and one posterior urethral valve. Patients underwent augmentation cystoplasty at a median age of 5 (range 1-15) years, using ileum in 10 and sigmoid colon in three. The channel for clean intermittent catheterisation was an appendix Mitrofanoff in nine and a Monti channel in four. An Amplatz sheath was placed through the Mitrofanoff to allow safe access to the bladder for treating the stones (see Summary Table). Recurrent stones were treated using the same technique. Stone and channel outcomes were analysed for each procedure. There were 22 procedures in 13 patients; five (38%) patients had recurrent stones. Median time to recurrence was 6 months. There were no immediate complications. Stone clearance was confirmed by ultrasound and abdominal x-ray at 3-6 months after the procedure. Median follow-up was 15 (range 3-53) months. There were no leaks or difficulties catheterising the channel on follow-up. This was the first series of Mitrofanoff/Monti cystolitholapaxy for the treatment of calculi in augmented bladders of paediatric patients. Previous concerns about damaging the continence mechanism of the conduit appeared to be unwarranted. The use of an Amplatz sheath protected the continence system from repeated instrumentation, and permitted free backflow of irrigation and rapid clearance of stone fragments. Recurrence of stones occurred in 38%, which was in keeping with rates reported in the wider literature. Mitrofanoff cystolitholapaxy was safe, and with appropriate care did not result in leakage or difficulty catheterising. ",0

Miglustat, a small iminosugar, reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the first committed step of glycosphingolipid synthesis. Miglustat is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is thus a potential therapy for neurological diseases. We aimed to establish the effect of miglustat on several markers of NPC severity. METHODS: Patients aged 12 years or older who had NPC (n=29) were randomly assigned to receive either miglustat 200 mg three times a day (n=20) or standard care (n=9) for 12 months. 12 children younger than 12 years of age were included in an additional cohort; all received miglustat at a dose adjusted for body surface area. All participants were then treated with miglustat for an additional year in an extension study. The primary endpoint was horizontal saccadic eye movement (HSEM) velocity, based on its correlation with disease progression. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN26761144. FINDINGS: At 12 months, HSEM velocity had improved in patients treated with miglustat versus those receiving standard care; results were significant when patients taking benzodiazepines were excluded (p=0.028). Children showed an improvement in HSEM velocity of similar size at 12 months. Improvement in swallowing capacity, stable auditory acuity, and a slower deterioration in ambulatory index were also seen in treated patients older than 12 years. The safety and tolerability of miglustat 200 mg three times a day in study participants was consistent with previous trials in type I Gaucher disease, where half this dose was used. INTERPRETATION: Miglustat improves or stabilises several clinically relevant markers of NPC. This is the first agent studied in NPC for which there is both animal and clinical data supporting a disease modifying benefit.""",1

1509,22920631,Innate immunity in the pathogenesis of cholangiopathy: a recent update,"Biliary innate immunity is involved in the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies in patients with various biliary diseases. Biliary epithelial cells possess an innate immune system consisting of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recently, regulatory mechanisms by intracellular negative regulators including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and micro-RNA have been clarified. In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis, dysregulated biliary innate immunity, namely hyper-responsiveness to PAMPs, is associated with the histopathogenesis of cholangiopathy. Moreover, biliary epithelial cells produce monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) as a result of the innate immune response and bile ductules play a role in hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Also, biliary innate immune responses induce the production of two chemokines, fractalkine and macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α), causing the migration of inflammatory cells and a population of antigen-presenting cell found in epithelium, Langerhans cell, and involve chronic cholangitis associated with biliary epithelium-specific innate and acquired immunity in PBC.

1511,7442740,Estrogens and endometrial cancer,"Retrospective case-control studies attempt to determine the relation of estrogens to endometrial cancer. However, the case group in such studies is a source of bias in that while the cases have undergone examinations for presence of cancer, the controls have not. A woman who does not receive estrogen can have an asymptomatic cancer that can remain undetected. As a solution to this bias, the authors designed a different case-control sampling procedure in which both controls and cases are chosen from patients given intraendometrial examinations. However, other investigators have rejected this method and have continued to use the conventional procedure without doing anything to avoid the overt bias in the case group. Shapiro et al (August 28 issue) presented the results of their conventional case/control groups with some new statistical tactics but the bias still remains. The bias cannot be eliminated until satisfactory sources of other data become available. Clinicians and pathologists are urged to evaluate the epidemiologist's basic assumption that all endometrial cancer cases can be detected clinically during the patient's lifetime: such assumption can be examined without using case-control studies, and new research may provide answers to the unresolved questions.",0
1512,29910053,Genetic burden and associations with adverse neurodevelopment in neonates with congenital heart disease,"""Up to 20% of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing cardiac surgery develop neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), with some studies reporting persistent impairment. Recent large-scale studies have demonstrated shared genetic mechanisms contributing to CHD and NDD. In this study, a targeted approach was applied to assess direct clinical applicability of this information. A gene panel comprising 148 known CHD and/or NDD genes was used to sequence 15 patients with CHD + NDD, 15 patients with CHD, and 15 healthy controls. The number and types of variants between the 3 groups were compared using Poisson log-linear regression, and the SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test-Optimized was used to conduct single-gene and gene-pathway burden analyses. A significant increase in rare (minor allele frequency < 0.01) and novel variants was identified between the CHD + NDD cohort and controls, P < .001 and P = .001, respectively. There was also a significant increase in rare variants in the CHD cohort compared with controls (P = .04). Rare variant burden analyses implicated pathways associated with """"neurotransmitters,"""" """"axon guidance,"""" and those incorporating """"RASopathy"""" genes in the development of NDD in CHD patients. These findings suggest that an increase in novel and rare variants in known CHD and/or NDD genes is associated with the development of NDD in patients with CHD. Furthermore, burden analyses point toward rare variant burden specifically in pathways related to brain development and function as contributors to NDD. Although promising variants and pathways were identified, further research, utilizing whole-genome approaches, is required prior to demonstrating clinical utility in this patient group. """,0

The cDNA of SmERF1 gene from S. miltiorrhiza was isolated by RTPCR, and the phylogenetic tree using the neighbour-joining tree method in Mega 5 was obtained. To confirm the protein is likely to localize in the nucleus, the SmERF1 coding region was fused to the N-terminus of the GFP gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and transferred into onion epidermal cells using the particle bombardment method. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed different expression pattern of SmERF1 gene in response to exogenous ABA, MeJA and SA. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that SmERF1 is most similar to AP2/ERF VII subgroup members. The transient expression of the SmERF1::GFP fusion protein indicated that the SmERF1 was exclusively localized to the nucleus. The transcript of SmERF1 highly accumulated when the plants were treated with MeJA, while accumulated slightly in response to exogenous ABA, salicylic acid. These results suggest hormone such as ABA, MeJA and SA signaling pathways can be involved in the activation and inhibition of the SmERF1. ",0
1514,23656522,Cancer 'survivor-care': II. Disruption of prefrontal brain activation top-down control of working memory capacity as possible mechanism for chemo-fog/brain (chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment),"Cancer chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairments (termed 'chemo-fog' or 'chemo-brain'), particularly in memory, have been self-reported or identified in cancer survivors previously treated with chemotherapy. Although a variety of deficits have been detected, a consistent theme is a detriment in visuospatial working memory. The parietal cortex, a major site of storage of such memory, is implicated in chemotherapy-induced damage. However, if the findings of two recent publications are combined, the (pre)frontal cortex might be an equally viable target. Two recent studies, one postulating a mechanism for 'top-down control' of working memory capacity and another visualizing chemotherapy-induced alterations in brain activation during working memory processing, are reviewed and integrated. A computational model and the proposal that the prefrontal cortex plays a role in working memory via top-down control of parietal working memory capacity is consistent with a recent demonstration of decreased frontal hyperactivation following chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-associated impairment of visuospatial working memory might include the (pre)frontal cortex in addition to the parietal cortex. This provides new opportunity for basic science and clinical investigation. ",0
1515,23353547,Toxicological evaluation of neem (Azadirachta indica) oil: acute and subacute toxicity,"Neem (Azadirachta indica), popularly known as traditional medicine is a native plant in India. Neem oil is a vegetable oil derived from seeds or fruits of the neem tree through pressing or solvent extraction, and largely used in popular medicine to have antifungal, antibacterial, antimalarial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, as well as immunemodulatory properties in different animal species. In the present study, acute and 28-day subacute toxicity tests were carried out. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 values of neem oil were found to be 31.95g/kg. The subacute treatment with neem oil failed to change body weight gain, food and water consumption. Serum biochemistry analysis showed no significant differences in any of the parameters examined under the dose of 1600mg/kg/day. Histopathological exams showed that the target organs of neem oil were testicle, liver and kidneys up to the dose of 1600mg/kg/day.",1
1516,30763776,Clinical evaluation of submental intubation as an alternative airway management technique in midface osteotomy,"The conventional endonasal intubation would not allow precise intra-operative assessment of the changes to the nasolabial soft tissue complex. Submental intubation allows accurate measurement of nasolabial soft tissue complex with no interference with the occlusion. A clinical prospective study was carried on 20 patients visiting the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department diagnosed of dentofacial deformity requiring orthognathic surgery. The patient were intubated by the submental route of anaesthesia. Intraoperatively time taken to perform intubation and bleeding during the surgery was noted. Post-operatively infection, presence or absence of any complications were noted along with the measurement of scar by Vancouver scar scale. Out of 20 patients 17 patients required only maxillary osteotomies whereas 3 patients required bimaxillary osteotomy. The mean time taken for intubation was 5.68 ± 1.257 minutes. In all the cases the scar was measured as minimum. 2 patients showed infection at the site of submental intubation after 7th day while after 14th day there was no infection present. No other complication was noted. 19 out of 20 cases showed no interference during the procedure whereas in 1 case mild interference during mandibular movement. The submental intubation is a very good alternative to nasotracheal intubation in the patients undergoing bimaxillary surgeries or maxillary surgeries. Submental intubation can be chosen whenever possible, as it is easy, takes little time and follow-up is simple, does not result in bleeding or other complications and more importantly does not result in any unaesthetic scar after 3rd month follow up.

1517,8477966,Augmented glucose use and pentose cycle activity in hepatic endothelial cells after in vivo endotoxemia,"Glucose use and pentose cycle activity were determined in freshly isolated rat hepatic endothelial cells 3 hr after an intravenous injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (0.1 mg/kg body weight), by use of [1-14C]glucose, [6-14C]glucose and [2-3H]glucose. Lipopolysaccharide treatment in vivo increased glucose use fivefold, whereas glucose oxidation in the pentose cycle was elevated from 0.2 to 1.5 nmol/hr/10(7) cells. In vitro incubation of endothelial cells from saline- and lipopolysaccharide-treated animals in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10(-6) mol/L) increased pentose cycle activity twofold and eightfold, respectively. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused only a 40% to 60% increase in glycolysis in both groups. Addition of t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 mmol/L), a substrate for glutathione peroxidase, caused a 24-fold and 16-fold increase in the glucose flux through the pentose cycle in cells from saline- and lipopolysaccharide-treated rats, respectively. Oxidation of glucose through the Krebs cycle was also increased several-fold after t-butyl hydroperoxide administration. Depletion of cellular glutathione by N-ethylmaleimide (0.1 mmol/L) inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced or t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced increase in the pentose cycle activity with no marked effects on glycolysis. Diphenyleneiodonium (0.1 mmol/L), an inhibitor of superoxide and nitric oxide synthesis inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced increased pentose cycle activity with no effects on the t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

1520,10389143,Interactive modulation by dopamine and serotonin neurons of receptor sensitivity of the alternate neurochemical system,"Ontogenetic dopaminergic denervation of rat forebrain is associated with latent supersensitization of dopamine (DA) receptors that is unmasked only by a priming process entailing repeated DA agonist treatments. Similar denervation supersensitivity holds for serotonin (5-HT) and most other neurochemical systems. Because DA and 5-HT neurons compete for target sites in the brain and mimic or replicate actions of the others, we investigated the modulatory influence of DA neurons on 5-HT receptor sensitivity; and role of 5-HT neurons in modulating DA receptor sensitivity. In these studies rats were lesioned with the DA neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, i.c.v.; desipramine pretreatment) or 5-HT neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, i.c.v.; desipramine pretreatment) either at 3 days after birth or in adulthood. Responses to DA and 5-HT agonists were determined in several behavioral paradigms in adulthood. In assessing oral responses to agonists, we found that the D1 agonist (+/-)-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol (SKF 38393) profoundly induced activity if rats were lesioned neonatally with 6-OHDA, but not if rats were co-lesioned as neonates or as adults with 5,7-DHT. The D2 agonist quinpirole induced profound oral activity, but only if rats were lesioned as neonates with 5,7-DHT; or if rats were lesioned with both 6-OHDA (neonatally administered) and 5,7-DHT (adult stage). In all rats lesioned as neonates with 6-OHDA, the 5-HT2 agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine produced enhanced activity, regardless of 5,7-DHT treatment. These findings demonstrate that DA neurons modulate receptor sensitivity status of both DA and 5-HT receptors; and 5-HT neurons do so similarly. This phenomenon is pertinent to animal models of human disorders and in the syndrome spectrum and treatment approach of human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), developmental disorders (e.g. hyperkinetic activity) and psychiatric disorders.

1521,9420342,Conflict of interest in the debate over calcium-channel antagonists,"BACKGROUND: Physicians' financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry are controversial because such relationships may pose a conflict of interest. It is unknown to what extent industry support of medical education and research influences the opinions and behavior of clinicians and researchers. The recent debate over the safety of calcium-channel antagonists provided an opportunity to examine the effect of financial conflicts of interest. METHODS: We searched the English-language medical literature published from March 1995 through September 1996 for articles examining the controversy about the safety of calcium-channel antagonists. Articles were reviewed and classified as being supportive, neutral, or critical with respect to the use of calcium-channel antagonists. The authors of the articles were asked about their financial relationships with both manufacturers of calcium-channel antagonists and manufacturers of competing products (i.e., beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and nitrates). We examined the authors' published positions on the safety of calcium-channel antagonists according to their financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies. RESULTS: Authors who supported the use of calcium-channel antagonists were significantly more likely than neutral or critical authors to have financial relationships with manufacturers of calcium-channel antagonists (96 percent, vs. 60 percent and 37 percent, respectively; P<0.001). Supportive authors were also more likely than neutral or critical authors to have financial relationships with any pharmaceutical manufacturer, irrespective of the product (100 percent, vs. 67 percent and 43 percent, respectively; P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a strong association between authors' published positions on the safety of calcium-channel antagonists and their financial relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The medical profession needs to develop a more effective policy on conflict of interest. We support complete disclosure of relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers for clinicians and researchers who write articles examining pharmaceutical products.",0

The uncontrolled clinical surveillance study included 16944 outpatients with subjective difficulties in initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Office-based neurologists, psychiatrists, internists and general practitioners were asked individually to adjust the dosage of zolpidem (age < or = 65 years, 10-20 mg; age > 65 years, 5-10 mg) over a recommended period of 3-4 weeks. In total, 82.8% of patients completed the survey (36% men, 64% women, mean age 58.8 +/- 14.9 years; 58.6% without previous hypnotic medication; duration of sleep complaints > 6 months in 40.6%, 1-6 months in 27.8%). Most patients (63.9%) took zolpidem on a daily basis. The average dose was 10 mg zolpidem per night in 74.8%, 5 mg in 19.8%, 20 mg in 2.4% and > 20 mg in 10 cases. Most physicians (87.6%) rated the efficacy of zolpidem as 'very good' or 'good'. One hundred and eighty-two (1.1%) of the 16 944 patients reported 268 adverse events (one adverse event in 113 cases, two adverse events in 53 cases and more than two adverse events in 16 cases). One hundred and eighteen (64.8%) of these patients (0.006% of all participating patients) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Nausea (n = 36), dizziness (n = 35), malaise (n = 23), nightmares (n = 20), agitation (n = 19), and headache (n = 18) were the most common adverse events. There was one serious adverse reaction in a 48-year-old women who developed paranoid symptoms during the documentation phase. No life-threatening adverse event occurred.

1524,7026404,Muscle protein breakdown in liver cirrhosis and the role of altered carbohydrate metabolism,"The rates of muscle protein breakdown, as estimated by the urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine, were assessed in 30 cirrhotics and 15 controls on a strictly controlled diet. 3-Methylhistidine excretion was increased in cirrhotics irrespective of the etiology of the disease, and correlated with basal glucagon levels and with the insulin/glucagon ratio. In nine cirrhotics and nine age- and sex-matched controls, similar correlations were found between 3-methylhistidine and the areas under 24-hr glucagon or insulin/glucagon curves. A larger amount of 3-methylhistidine was excreted during the nighttime than during the daytime, when glucagon secretion was suppressed and the insulin/glucagon ratio was increased. It is concluded that muscle protein catabolism is increased in cirrhotics, possibly as a result of hyperglucagonemia or the reduced insulin/glucagon ratio. These data agree with the clinical observation of a progressive reduction in lean body mass which becomes evident in an advanced stage of the disease.",0

While the anakinra safety profile is well established in RA, the long-term safety profile in severe CAPS is less well documented and will therefore be discussed in this report. METHODS: A prospective, open-label, single centre, clinical cohort study was conducted at the National Institutes of Health in the USA, from 2003 to 2010, investigating the efficacy and safety of anakinra treatment for up to 5 years in 43 patients with CAPS. Safety was evaluated using adverse event (AE) reports, laboratory assessments, vital signs and diary reports. RESULTS: In total, 1233 AEs were reported during the study, with a yearly rate of 7.7 AEs per patient. The event rate decreased over time, and dose escalation during the study did not affect AE frequency. Anakinra had similar safety profiles in adults and children. The most frequently reported AEs were typical CAPS disease symptoms such as headache and arthralgia. Injection site reactions occurred mainly during the first month of anakinra treatment. In total, 14 patients experienced 24 serious AEs (SAEs), all of which resolved during the study period. The most common types of SAEs were infections such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis. There were no permanent discontinuations of treatment due to AEs. CONCLUSION: In this study anakinra treatment of patients with severe CAPS for up to 5 years was safe and well tolerated both in paediatric and adult patients, with most AEs emerging during the first months after treatment initiation.

We report herein two cases of patients treated by a 1-hour Hyperthermic Isolated Liver Perfusion (HILP) with a combination of melphalan and bevacizumab leading to complete response. The first patient had liver metastases secondary to previously resected malignant glucagonoma and the second, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. We used bevacizumab in association with melphalan for HILP because of the additional effect of an anti-VEGF antibody in these highly vascularized tumors and its locally restricted delivery to the isolated hepatic vascular compartment despite of its classic contraindication in association with surgery. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee. Enhanced CT scans during follow-up showed complete tumor necrosis as early as the second postoperative day. Patients had 27 and 7 months disease-free survival and 48 and 41 months overall survival after HILP, for neuroendocrine liver metastases and HILP plus liver transplantation for HCC respectively. Under very specific conditions, bevacizumab in HILP can provide excellent tumor response in hopeless clinical cases of liver tumors.",1

Once-daily daclatasvir, a potent NS5A replication complex inhibitor, was generally well tolerated in phase 1 studies. We assessed daclatasvir in combination with pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin for chronic HCV. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding, phase 2a study, treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype-1 infection (without cirrhosis) from 14 centres in the USA and France were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive peginterferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg daily) plus placebo or 3 mg, 10 mg, or 60 mg of daclatasvir taken once daily, for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was undetectable HCV RNA at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after start of treatment (extended rapid virological response, eRVR). Analysis was of all participants who received one dose of study drug. We used descriptive analyses to compare results. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00874770. FINDINGS: 48 patients were randomly assigned (12 per group); all received at least one dose of study drug. 15 patients discontinued treatment before week 48. Five of 12 patients (42%, 80% CI 22-64%) who received 3 mg daclatasvir achieved eRVR, compared with ten of 12 (83%, 61-96%) who received 10 mg daclatasvir, nine of 12 (75%, 53-90%) who received 60 mg daclatasvir, and one of 12 (8%, 1-29%) who received placebo. Adverse events and discontinuations as a result of adverse events occurred with similar frequency across groups. INTERPRETATION: Daclatasvir seems to be a potent NS5A replication complex inhibitor that increases the antiviral potency of peginterferon and ribavirin. Our findings support the further development of regimens containing 60 mg daclatasvir for the treatment of chronic genotype-1 HCV infection. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.""",1

No evidence for an inhibitor against factor VIII procoagulant activity or von Willebrand factor activity was detected, but immunoelectrophoresis showed none of the less anodic forms of factor VIII antigen. There were concomitant decreases in total antigen (0.19 U per milliliter) and von Willebrand factor levels (0.12 U per milliliter). Factor VIII-procoagulant activity was borderline low (0.45 U per milliliter). Correction of both the abnormal immunoelectrophoresis pattern and the quantitative abnormalities followed radiotherapy of the lymphoma. The factor VIII abnormalities might have resulted from binding or destruction of theless anodic forms of factor VIII antigen by the malignant lymphocytes.",0
1532,18844235,Adenosine induces loss of actin stress fibers and inhibits contraction in hepatic stellate cells via Rho inhibition,"The Rho/ROCK pathway is activated in differentiated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and is necessary for assembly of actin stress fibers, contractility, and chemotaxis. Despite the importance of this pathway in HSC biology, physiological inhibitors of the Rho/ROCK pathway in HSCs are not known. We demonstrate that adenosine induces loss of actin stress fibers in the LX-2 cell line and primary HSCs in a manner indistinguishable from Rho/ROCK inhibition. Loss of actin stress fibers occurs via the A2a receptor at adenosine concentrations above 10 muM, which are present during tissue injury. We further demonstrate that loss of actin stress fibers is due to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate, protein kinase A-mediated pathway that results in Rho inhibition. Furthermore, a constitutively active Rho construct can inhibit the ability of adenosine to induce loss of actin stress fibers. Actin stress fibers are required for HSC contraction, and we demonstrate that adenosine inhibits endothelin-1 and lysophosphatidic acid-mediated HSC contraction. We propose that adenosine is a physiological inhibitor of the Rho pathway in HSCs with functional consequences, including loss of HSC contraction.",0
1533,24330029,Inefficacy of a highly selective T-type calcium channel blocker in preventing atrial fibrillation related remodeling,"The T-type Ca(2+) channel (I(CaT)) blocker mibefradil prevents AF-promoting remodeling occurring with atrial tachycardia, an action that has been attributed to I(CaT) inhibition. However, mibefradil has other effects, including ability to inhibit L-type Ca(2+) channels, Na(+) channels and cytochromes. Thus, the relationship between I(CaT) inhibition and remodeling protection in AF is still unknown. To assess the effects of a novel highly selective Cav3 (I(CaT)) blocker, AZ9112, on atrial remodeling induced by 1-week atrial tachypacing (AT-P) in dogs. Mongrel dogs were subjected to AT-P at 400 bpm for 7 days, with atrioventricular-node ablation and right-ventricular demand pacing (80 bpm) to control ventricular rate. Four groups of dogs were studied in investigator-blinded fashion: (1) a sham group, instrumented but without tachypacing or drug therapy (n = 5); (2) a placebo group, tachypaced but receiving placebo (n = 6); (3) a positive control tachypacing group receiving mibefradil (n = 6); and (4) a test drug group, subjected to tachypacing during oral treatment with AZ9112 (n = 8). One-week AT-P decreased atrial effective refractory period (ERP) at 6 of 8 sites and diminished rate-dependent atrial ERP abbreviation. Mibefradil eliminated AT-P-induced ERP-abbreviation at 4 of these 6 sites, while AZ9112 failed to affect ERP at any. Neither drug significantly affected AF vulnerability or AF duration. I(CaT) blockade with the highly selective compound AZ9112 failed to prevent rate-related atrial remodeling. Thus, prevention of atrial electrophysiological remodeling by mibefradil cannot be attributed exclusively to I(CaT) blockade. These results indicate that I(CaT) inhibition is not likely to be a useful approach for AF therapy. ",0

1536,11283839,Cholestatic expression pattern of sinusoidal and canalicular organic anion transport systems in primary cultured rat hepatocytes,"To maintain ongoing vectorial bile secretion, hepatocytes localize distinct transport systems at their basolateral and canalicular membrane domains. Here we compare the expression of the basolateral Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporter (Ntcp) and organic anion transporting polypeptides 1 and 2 (Oatp1, Oatp2) and the canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. During 72 hours of culturing time the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of Ntcp and Oatp1 decreased in parallel to 2% to 7% of initial values at 3 hours. Although Oatp2 mRNA exhibited a similar down-regulation to 4%, Oatp2 protein and function were maintained at 25% to 47% of initial values. Furthermore, Bsep and Mrp2 protein levels were maintained at about 50%, while the Mrp2 mRNA showed a transient up-regulation to 154% at 24 and 48 hours. Also, induction of Mrp1 mRNA and protein was observed starting after 24 hours. These results indicate transcriptional down-regulation or decreased mRNA stability of Ntcp and Oatp1, transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of Oatp2, Bsep, and Mrp2 and transcriptional up-regulation of Mrp1 in primary cultured hepatocytes. Furthermore, and most importantly, the observed changes in transporter expression closely resemble the altered transporter phenotypes of cholestatic and proliferating hepatocytes in vivo, thus indicating that primary cultured hepatocytes acquire a cholestatic phenotype, and that the transporter expression might be a suitable differentiation marker for maintenance of hepatocytes in vitro.",0

1538,31433921,Myocardial Viability and Long-Term Outcomes in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: The role of assessment of myocardial viability in identifying patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who might benefit from surgical revascularization remains controversial. Furthermore, although improvement in left ventricular function is one of the goals of revascularization, its relationship to subsequent outcomes is unclear. METHODS: Among 601 patients who had coronary artery disease that was amenable to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or lower, we prospectively assessed myocardial viability using single-photon-emission computed tomography, dobutamine echocardiography, or both. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo CABG and receive medical therapy or to receive medical therapy alone. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at baseline and after 4 months of follow-up in 318 patients. The primary end point was death from any cause. The median duration of follow-up was 10.4 years. RESULTS: CABG plus medical therapy was associated with a lower incidence of death from any cause than medical therapy alone (182 deaths among 298 patients in the CABG group vs. 209 deaths among 303 patients in the medical-therapy group; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.90). However, no significant interaction was observed between the presence or absence of myocardial viability and the beneficial effect of CABG plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone (P?=?0.34 for interaction). An increase in left ventricular ejection fraction was observed only among patients with myocardial viability, irrespective of treatment assignment. There was no association between changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and subsequent death. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study do not support the concept that myocardial viability is associated with a long-term benefit of CABG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The presence of viable myocardium was associated with improvement in left ventricular systolic function, irrespective of treatment, but such improvement was not related to long-term survival.

1539,28957315,"The diversity of the Chagas parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, infecting the main Central American vector, Triatoma dimidiata, from Mexico to Colombia","Little is known about the strains of Trypanosoma cruzi circulating in Central America and specifically in the most important vector in this region, Triatoma dimidiata. Approximately six million people are infected with T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, which has the greatest negative economic impact and is responsible for ~12,000 deaths annually in Latin America. By international consensus, strains of T. cruzi are divided into six monophyletic clades called discrete typing units (DTUs TcI-VI) and a seventh DTU first identified in bats called TcBat. TcI shows the greatest geographic range and diversity. Identifying strains present and diversity within these strains is important as different strains and their genotypes may cause different pathologies and may circulate in different localities and transmission cycles, thus impacting control efforts, treatment and vaccine development. To determine parasite strains present in T. dimidiata across its geographic range from Mexico to Colombia, we isolated abdominal DNA from T. dimidiata and determined which specimens were infected with T. cruzi by PCR. Strains from infected insects were determined by comparing the sequence of the 18S rDNA and the spliced-leader intergenic region to typed strains in GenBank. Two DTUs were found: 94% of infected T. dimidiata contained TcI and 6% contained TcIV. TcI exhibited high genetic diversity. Geographic structure of TcI haplotypes was evident by Principal Component and Median-Joining Network analyses as well as a significant result in the Mantel test, indicating isolation by distance. There was little evidence of association with TcI haplotypes and host/vector or ecotope. This study provides new information about the strains circulating in the most important Chagas vector in Central America and reveals considerable variability within TcI as well as geographic structuring at this large geographic scale. The lack of association with particular vectors/hosts or ecotopes suggests the parasites are moving among vectors/hosts and ecotopes therefore a comprehensive approach, such as the Ecohealth approach that makes houses refractory to the vectors will be needed to successfully halt transmission of Chagas disease.

1540,23929627,Dynamic expression profiling of type I and type III interferon-stimulated hepatocytes reveals a stable hierarchy of gene expression,"Despite activating similar signaling cascades, the type I and type III interferons (IFNs) differ in their ability to antagonize virus replication. However, it is not clear whether these cytokines induce unique antiviral states, particularly in the liver, where the clinically important hepatitis B and C viruses cause persistent infection. Here, clustering and promoter analyses of microarray-based gene expression profiling were combined with mechanistic studies of signaling pathways to dynamically characterize the transcriptional responses induced by these cytokines in Huh7 hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. Type I and III IFNs differed greatly in their level of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) induction with a clearly detectable hierarchy (IFN-??>?IFN-??>?IFN-?3?>?IFN-?1?>?IFN-?2). Notably, although the hierarchy identified varying numbers of differentially expressed genes when quantified using common statistical thresholds, further analysis of gene expression over multiple timepoints indicated that the individual IFNs do not in fact regulate unique sets of genes. The kinetic profiles of IFN-induced gene expression were also qualitatively similar with the important exception of IFN-?. While stimulation with either IFN-? or IFN-?s resulted in a similar long-lasting ISG induction, IFN-? signaling peaked early after stimulation then declined due to a negative feedback mechanism. The quantitative expression hierarchy and unique kinetics of IFN-? reveal potential specific roles for individual IFNs in the immune response, and elucidate the mechanism behind previously observed differences in IFN antiviral activity. While current clinical trials are focused on IFN-?1 as a potential antiviral therapy, the finding that IFN-?3 invariably possesses the highest activity among type III IFNs suggests that this cytokine may have superior clinical activity.",0
1541,21327704,Drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis,"The clinical phenotype of classical autoimmune hepatitis can be mimicked by idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, and differentiation can be difficult. The goals of this review are to enumerate the major agents of drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis, describe the clinical findings and risk factors associated with it, detail the clinical tools by which to assess causality, discuss putative pathogenic mechanisms, and describe treatment and outcome. The frequency of drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis among patients with classical features of autoimmune hepatitis is 9%. Minocycline and nitrofurantoin are implicated in 90% of cases. Female predominance, acute onset, and absence of cirrhosis at presentation are important clinical manifestations. Genetic factors affecting phase I and phase II transformations of the drug, polymorphisms that protect against cellular oxidative stress, and human leukocyte antigens that modulate the immune response may be important pathogenic components. Clinical judgment is the mainstay of diagnosis as structured diagnostic methods for drug-induced liver injury are imperfect. The covalent binding of a reactive drug metabolite to a hepatocyte surface protein (commonly a phase I or phase II enzyme), formation of a neoantigen, activation of CD8 T lymphocytes with nonselective antigen receptors, and deficient immune regulatory mechanisms are the main bases for a transient loss of self-tolerance. Discontinuation of the offending drug is the essential treatment. Spontaneous improvement usually ensues within 1 month. Corticosteroid therapy is warranted for symptomatic severe disease, and it is almost invariably effective. Relapse after corticosteroid withdrawal probably does not occur, and its absence distinguishes drug-induced disease from classical autoimmune hepatitis.",1
1542,16163639,Liver injury and changes in hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA load associated with protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy for treatment-naive HCV-HIV-coinfected patients: lopinavir-ritonavir versus nelfinavir,"""BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with transaminase and HCV viral load flares. Previous studies have included highly variable antiretroviral regimens. We compared effects of 2 protease inhibitor-based regimens on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and HCV loads in HCV-HIV-coinfected patients initiating HAART. METHODS: Seventy HIV-infected patients with positive baseline results of HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay from a treatment trial comparing lopinavir-ritonavir with nelfinavir were evaluated during a 48-week period. HCV and HIV titers were analyzed at baseline, at weeks 24 and 48 of treatment, and during flares in the ALT level of >5 times the upper limit of normal. RESULTS: A total of 57 of 70 patients tested positive for HCV RNA at baseline. HCV titers for patients in lopinavir-ritonavir and nelfinavir groups, respectively, were as follows: baseline, 6.07 and 6.22 log IU/mL; week 24 of treatment, 6.68 and 6.48 log IU/mL; and week 48 of treatment, 6.32 and 6.44 log IU/mL. Of patients with a CD4+ cell count of <100 cells/mm3 at baseline, 5 of 11 in the nelfinavir group and 0 of 10 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group had an increase in the HCV load of >0.5 log IU/mL from baseline to week 48. The mean ALT level increased by 45 U/L at 24 weeks and 18 U/L at 48 weeks in the nelfinavir group but decreased by 18 U/L at 24 weeks and 7 U/L at 48 weeks in the lopinavir-ritonavir group. Eight patients in the nelfinavir group and 2 patients in the lopinavir-ritonavir group had grade 3 or 4 flares in the ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: HAART initiation is associated with increased HCV loads and ALT levels. A low baseline CD4+ cell count is associated with persistent increases in the HCV RNA load in nelfinavir-treated patients. These results warrant careful interpretation of abnormalities in the ALT load after HAART initiation in HCV-HIV-coinfected patients to prevent premature discontinuation of treatment.""",1
1543,24912841,TIGIT safeguards liver regeneration through regulating natural killer cell-hepatocyte crosstalk,"Overactivation of innate immunity, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, is harmful to liver regeneration; however, the molecular mechanisms that limit NK cell overactivation during liver regeneration are still elusive. Here we show that a coinhibitory receptor, T cell Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT), was selectively up-regulated on NK cells, along with high expression of its ligand, poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155), on hepatocytes during liver regeneration. The absence of TIGIT impaired liver regeneration in vivo, along with overactivation of NK cells and higher NK-derived interferon-gamma (IFN-?) production. We also show that both depletion of NK cells and deficiency of IFN-?, but not deficiency of RAG1, rescued impaired liver regeneration caused by the absence of TIGIT. Adoptive transfer of Tigit(-/-) NK cells into NK-deficient Nfil3(-/-) mice sufficiently led to impairment of liver regeneration. On the other hand, silencing PVR in hepatocytes rescued impaired liver regeneration caused by TIGIT deficiency in vivo, while blockade of TIGIT in NK-hepatocyte coculture increased IFN-? production by NK cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: TIGIT is a safeguard molecule to improve liver regeneration through negatively regulating NK-hepatocyte crosstalk. This finding suggests a novel mechanism of NK cell self-tolerance towards regenerative hyperplasia of the host.",0

We performed a prospective case-control association study to identify the incidence, pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and biochemical predictors for anti-tubercular and antiretroviral drugs induced liver injury (DILI) in HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Newly diagnosed treatment na?ve TB-HIV co-infected patients (n?=?353) were enrolled to receive efavirenz based ART and rifampicin based anti-TB therapy, and assessed clinically and biochemically for DILI up to 56 weeks. Quantification of plasma efavirenz and 8-hydroxyefaviernz levels and genotyping for NAT2, CYP2B6, CYP3A5, ABCB1, UGT2B7 and SLCO1B1 genes were done. The incidence of DILI and identification of predictors was evaluated using survival analysis and the Cox Proportional Hazards Model. The incidence of DILI was 30.0%, or 14.5 per 1000 person-week, and that of severe was 18.4%, or 7.49 per 1000 person-week. A statistically significant association of DILI with being of the female sex (p?=?0.001), higher plasma efavirenz level (p?=?0.009), efavirenz/8-hydroxyefavirenz ratio (p?=?0.036), baseline AST (p?=?0.022), ALT (p?=?0.014), lower hemoglobin (p?=?0.008), and serum albumin (p?=?0.007), NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype (p?=?0.039) and ABCB1 3435TT genotype (p?=?0.001). CONCLUSION: We report high incidence of anti-tubercular and antiretroviral DILI in Ethiopian patients. Between patient variability in systemic efavirenz exposure and pharmacogenetic variations in NAT2, CYP2B6 and ABCB1 genes determines susceptibility to DILI in TB-HIV co-infected patients. Close monitoring of plasma efavirenz level and liver enzymes during early therapy and/or genotyping practice in HIV clinics is recommended for early identification of patients at risk of DILI.",1

1548,25252816,Molecular and cellular control of cell death and defense signaling in pepper,"Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) provides a good experimental system for studying the molecular and functional genomics underlying the ability of plants to defend themselves against microbial pathogens. Cell death is a genetically programmed response that requires specific host cellular factors. Hypersensitive response (HR) is defined as rapid cell death in response to a pathogen attack. Pepper plants respond to pathogen attacks by activating genetically controlled HR- or disease-associated cell death. HR cell death, specifically in incompatible interactions between pepper and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, is mediated by the molecular genetics and biochemical machinery that underlie pathogen-induced cell death in plants. Gene expression profiles during the HR-like cell death response, virus-induced gene silencing and transient and transgenic overexpression approaches are used to isolate and identify HR- or disease-associated cell death genes in pepper plants. Reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, cytosolic calcium ion and defense-related hormones such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and abscisic acid are involved in the execution of pathogen-induced cell death in plants. In this review, we summarize recent molecular and cellular studies of the pepper cell death-mediated defense response, highlighting the signaling events of cell death in disease-resistant pepper plants. Comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the cellular functions of pepper cell death response genes will aid the development of novel practical approaches to enhance disease resistance in pepper, thereby helping to secure the future supply of safe and nutritious pepper plants worldwide.

METHODS: Golimumab 50 and 100 mg, administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (q4wk), were assessed in patients with active RA (methotrexate-naive, methotrexate-experienced and anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-experienced), PsA or AS, despite conventional therapy. Placebo control continued up to week (wk) 24 (wk 52, methotrexate-naive), with early escape at wk 16 (wk 28, methotrexate-naive); subsequently, all patients received golimumab 50 or 100 mg q4wk. After the blinded controlled period, golimumab doses could be adjusted per investigator discretion. Pooled safety analyses reported herein include data from placebo-controlled and uncontrolled study periods up to wk 160. Determinations of incidences/100 patient-years (pt-yrs) for rare events also included RA patients from a phase IIb trial. RESULTS: Across five phase III trials of SC golimumab, 639 patients received placebo and 2226 received golimumab 50 mg (n=1249) and/or 100 mg (n=1501) up to wk 160 (patients may be included in more than one group because non-responders were allowed early escape); 1179 patients were treated for >/=156 weeks. For placebo, golimumab 50 mg and golimumab 100 mg, respective adverse event incidences/100 pt-yrs (95% CIs) up to wk 160 were: 0.28 (0.01 to 1.56), 0.30 (0.12 to 0.62), 0.41 (0.23 to 0.69) for death; 5.31 (3.20 to 8.30), 3.03 (2.36 to 3.82), 5.09 (4.36 to 5.90) for serious infection; 0.00 (0.00 to 0.84), 0.17 (0.05 to 0.44), 0.35 (0.18 to 0.62) for tuberculosis; 0.00 (0.00 to 0.84), 0.13 (0.03 to 0.38), 0.24 (0.10 to 0.46) for opportunistic infection; 0.00 (0.00 to 0.84), 0.00 (0.00 to 0.13), 0.12 (0.03 to 0.30) for demyelination; and 0.00 (0.00 to 0.84), 0.04 (0.00 to 0.24), 0.18 (0.06 to 0.38) for lymphoma.

Carnosol has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory properties. This study examined the suppressive effect of carnosol on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and chemokines in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the possible underlying mechanism. The effect of carnosol on CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs was identified by western blotting and ELISA, respectively. nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation of HUVECs was analyzed using the TransAM NF-κB Family kit. The effect of carnosol on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced activation of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and was subsequently analyzed using western blotting. Carnosol not only inhibited TNF-α-induced protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs, but also suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 expression. In addition, carnosol inhibited the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p-65 and IκB-α, as well as the activation of NF-κB. The same result was observed in TNF-α-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p-38. It was demonstrated that carnosol inhibited TNF-α-induced CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the blocking of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. These results indicate that carnosol may be a novel therapeutic agent for targeting endothelial cells in IBDs. ",0

GP82 and GP90 are glycoproteins expressed at the surface of metacyclic trypomastigote, with opposite roles in mammalian cell invasion. GP82 is an adhesin that promotes cell invasion, while GP90 acts as a negative regulator of parasite internalization. Our understanding of the synthesis and intracellular trafficking of GP82 and GP90 during metacyclogenesis is still limited. Therefore, we decided to determine whether GP82 and GP90 are expressed only in fully differentiated metacyclic forms or they start to be expressed in intermediate forms undergoing differentiation. Parasite populations enriched in intermediate forms undergoing differentiation were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence to assess GP82 and GP90 expression. We found that GP82 and GP90 mRNAs and proteins are expressed in intermediate forms and reach higher levels in fully differentiated metacyclic forms. Surprisingly, GP82 and GP90 presented distinct cellular localizations in intermediate forms compared to metacyclic trypomastigotes. In intermediate forms, GP82 is localized in organelles at the posterior region and colocalizes with cruzipain, while GP90 is localized at the flagellar pocket region. This study discloses new aspects of protein expression and trafficking during T. cruzi differentiation by showing that the machinery involved in GP82 and GP90 gene expression starts to operate early in the differentiation process and that different secretion pathways are responsible for delivering these glycoproteins toward the cell surface.

Serum levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and the total and free forms of IS and p-CS were determined. Patients with a history of frequent VA failure and dysfunction had lower albumin and higher levels of ICAM-1, free IS, free and total p-CS. Diabetes was associated with higher IS and p-CS. Logistic regression revealed that diabetes and free p-CS were independent factors associated with poor outcome of VA. Endothelial dysfunction and uremic toxins were associated with survival and function of VA. Diabetes and free p-CS were significantly related to the outcome of VA among chronic HD patients. ",0

Southern blot analysis with two overlapping FMR1 cDNA clones, spanning the total FMR1 open reading frame, showed no major deletions, insertions, or gross rearrangements. Single-strand conformation pattern (SSCP) analysis of the KH domains showed no aberrant patterns. The total open reading frame of the FMR1 gene was cloned and sequenced, but no mutation was found. Northern blot analysis showed mRNA in the normal size-range, and immunocytochemistry on individual lymphocytes indicated that FMRP, the protein product of FMR1, was present.

We evaluated incidence rates of acute liver injury associated with oral azole antifungals. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who initiated an oral azole antifungal in an outpatient setting during 2004-2010. We determined development of: (1) liver aminotransferases >200 U/L, (2) severe acute liver injury (coagulopathy with hyperbilirubinemia), and (3) acute liver failure.

Severe acute liver injury was uncommon with fluconazole (2.0 [1.4-2.7]), ketoconazole (2.9 [1.1-6.3]), and itraconazole (0.0 [0.0-11.2]), but more frequent with voriconazole (16.7 [2.0-60.2]) and posaconazole (93.4 [2.4-520.6]). One patient developed acute liver failure due to ketoconazole. Pre-existing chronic liver disease increased risks of aminotransferases >200 U/L (hazard ratio 4.68 [95% CI, 3.68-5.94]) and severe acute liver injury (hazard ratio 5.62 [95% CI, 2.56-12.35]). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of acute liver injury were similarly low for fluconazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole. Events were more common among voriconazole and posaconazole users but were comparable. Pre-existing chronic liver disease increased risk of azole-induced liver injury.""",1
1560,12086547,Possible gatifloxacin-induced fulminant hepatic failure,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fulminant hepatic failure associated with the use of gatifloxacin. CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old white man was found to have an approximate 1-week history of worsening jaundice on the last day of a 10-day course of gatifloxacin for treatment of impetigo while at his skilled nursing facility. Liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and ammonia concentrations were found to be markedly elevated, consistent with hepatocellular necrosis commonly seen with fluoroquinolones. Screening for other causes of hepatotoxicity, including alcoholic or viral hepatitis, obstruction, or autoimmune-mediated processes, were negative. Other potential medication causes were less likely. The patient's liver function steadily declined, eventually resulting in multiple organ failure. The patient died 25 days after completing the course of gatifloxacin. DISCUSSION: This case of hepatotoxicity was associated with gatifloxacin. Other fluoroquinolones, most notably trovafloxacin, have been observed to cause variable degrees of hepatotoxicity, ranging from asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes to fulminant hepatic failure. Fluoroquinolones are thought to cause hepatocellular necrosis, which results in elevated ALT and AST concentrations with a normal alkaline phosphatase concentration. A variable degree of hyperbilirubinemia is often seen, with the presence and degree of jaundice often correlating to a poorer prognosis. Hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy are also commonly present. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroquinolones, including trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, and, in this case report, gatifloxacin, have been associated with hepatotoxicity. It is important that these medications be considered a possible cause when the patient being treated has liver disease.",1
1561,19010650,"Suspected hepatotoxicity by Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma (black cohosh, root): critical analysis and structured causality assessment","Severe hepatotoxicity has been described as spontaneous or case reports in 42 patients in assumed causal relationship with the treatment by Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma corresponding to the root of black cohosh (BC) for postmenopausal symptoms. However, an assessment by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) has shown a possible or probable causality in only 4 out of 42 patients. A diagnostic algorithm was now applied in the 4 patients with suspected BC hepatotoxicity, which included the qualitative and quantitative causality assessment of the updated system of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), allowing the study to objectively assess, score and scale the probability in each case. Due to incomplete data, the case of 1 patient was not assessable. In the remaining 3 patients, a severe course of liver disease was apparent, and steroid therapy was initiated under the provisional diagnosis of drug-induced hepatic injury. The analysis shows, however, that the observed liver diseases were unrelated to drugs. Only 1 patient had a favourable course under continued steroid therapy, and the final diagnosis was autoimmune hepatitis. The 2 other patients required liver transplantation under the final diagnosis of herpetic hepatitis established now. Quantitative evaluation showed no causality for BC in all 3 patients regarding the observed severe liver disease. Using a thorough causality assessment in the form of a diagnostic algorithm we have shown that there is no evidence for a causal relationship between treatment by black cohosh and the observed liver disease in the 4 patients.",1
1562,17086563,Use of cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (COX-2) and prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in UK and USA populations. Implications for COX-2 cardiovascular profile,"BACKGROUND: COX-2 and NSAIDS differ in their gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) toxicity from pharmacological, clinical and epidemiologic point of views. OBJECTIVE: Describe the patterns of use of NSAIDS and COX-2 in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database in UK and the PharMetrics database in USA. METHODS: We examined the experience of 10 distinct cohorts of new users of diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, piroxicam, other NSAIDS, meloxicam, celecoxib, etoricoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib. The study period was 1 January 1995 through 2004 (31 March in UK and 28 February in USA). We collected information on covariates including history of upper GI disease, CV disease, hepatic disease, dosage, concomitant medication, and visits to a rheumatologist. RESULTS: We identified 486 076 unique patient-drug pairs in UK and 1 533 239 in USA. In UK population 78 201 (16%) were COX-2 users and in PharMetrics 324 206 (21%) were COX-2 users. Diclofenac and ibuprofen (NSAIDS), and celecoxib and rofecoxib (COX-2) were the agents prescribed most frequently. The duration of therapy was longer among celecoxib and rofecoxib users than among other users. More COX-2 users than NSAIDS users received concomitant gastroprotective agents (GPA), corticosteroids and anti-platelet therapy, and had a history of thromboembolic events and hypertension. PharMetrics patients were prescribed higher doses of NSAIDS and COX-2. The use of any single agent for more than 90 days was uncommon, but more frequent in PharMetrics. Switching was uncommon and was generally to a NSAID. DISCUSSION: Our results confirm some previous findings from other authors such as the presence of both GI and CV channelling to COX-2 agents but refute others, such as the frequency of drug switching between these agents. The typical use of COX-2 agents in practice is for shorter duration, and at lower doses, than was employed in randomized clinical trials. This difference may help clarify the apparent discrepancy with respect to CV toxicity between the results from clinical trials, which showed a higher CV risk with these drugs, and non-experimental epidemiologic studies, which showed lower or no increase in risk.",1
1563,24523439,"A phase I, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human, dose-escalation study of the oral smoothened inhibitor Sonidegib (LDE225) in patients with advanced solid tumors","PURPOSE: This phase I trial was undertaken to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel smoothened inhibitor sonidegib (LDE225), a potent inhibitor of hedgehog signaling, in patients with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Oral sonidegib was administered to 103 patients with advanced solid tumors, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), at doses ranging from 100 to 3,000 mg daily and 250 to 750 mg twice daily, continuously, with a single-dose pharmacokinetics run-in period. Dose escalations were guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model. Safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers in skin and tumor biopsies were assessed. RESULTS: The MTDs of sonidegib were 800 mg daily and 250 mg twice daily. The main DLT of reversible grade 3/4 elevated serum creatine kinase (18% of patients) was observed at doses ? the MTD in an exposure-dependent manner. Common grade 1/2 adverse events included muscle spasm, myalgia, gastrointestinal toxicities, increased liver enzymes, fatigue, dysgeusia, and alopecia. Sonidegib exposure increased dose proportionally up to 400 mg daily, and displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetics at higher doses. Sonidegib exhibited exposure-dependent reduction in GLI1 mRNA expression. Tumor responses observed in patients with medulloblastoma and BCC were associated with evidence of hedgehog pathway activation. CONCLUSIONS: Sonidegib has an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors and exhibits antitumor activity in advanced BCC and relapsed medulloblastoma, both of which are strongly associated with activated hedgehog pathway, as determined by gene expression.",1
1564,23757384,Cholestatic jaundice as a result of combination designer supplement ingestion,"""OBJECTIVE: To report a case of cholestatic jaundice as a result of combination herbal and designer supplement use. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old Hispanic male presented to the hospital with a 1-week history of significant painless jaundice; total bilirubin on admission was 29.4 mg/dL. He reported use of both herbal (creatine and whey protein) and designer (Incredible Bulk and Spartan 45) supplements concurrently for approximately 2 months. Upon admission, all supplements were discontinued and multiple laboratory and diagnostic tests were ordered. On day 6 of his hospital admission, a liver biopsy was performed, the results of which indicated drug-induced hepa to toxicity. On day 9 he was discharged with prescriptions for ursodeoxycholic acid and hydroxyzine. Three months post hospital discharge, the patient continued to be supplement-free and bilirubin had decreased substantially. DISCUSSION: Anabolic-androgenic steroids are capable of causing hepatotoxicity, and multiple cases reported in the literature support this. A case report described hepato toxicity secondary to both creatine and whey protein consumption, and several reports have described liver damage secondary to designer supplement use. To our knowledge, this is the first case to describe hepatotoxicity as a result of combination herbal and designer supplement use. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assess ment Method (RUCAM) score for drug-induced hepatotoxicity indicated a highly probable correlation between the use of combination supplements and cholestatic jaundice. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals need to be aware of complications associated with designer supplement use and should be able to identify patients who would benefit from education on herbal and designer supplement use.""",1
1565,10063482,The neuropsychopharmacology of phencyclidine: from NMDA receptor hypofunction to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia,"Administration of noncompetitive NMDA/glutamate receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, to humans induces a broad range of schizophrenic-like symptomatology, findings that have contributed to a hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia. Moreover, a history of experimental investigations of the effects of these drugs in animals suggests that NMDA receptor antagonists may model some behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia in nonhuman subjects. In this review, the usefulness of PCP administration as a potential animal model of schizophrenia is considered. To support the contention that NMDA receptor antagonist administration represents a viable model of schizophrenia, the behavioral and neurobiological effects of these drugs are discussed, especially with regard to differing profiles following single-dose and long-term exposure. The neurochemical effects of NMDA receptor antagonist administration are argued to support a neurobiological hypothesis of schizophrenia, which includes pathophysiology within several neurotransmitter systems, manifested in behavioral pathology. Future directions for the application of NMDA receptor antagonist models of schizophrenia to preclinical and pathophysiological research are offered.",1
1566,28940260,Authentication of M14 melanoma cell line proves misidentification of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line,"A variety of analytical approaches have indicated that melanoma cell line UCLA-SO-M14 (M14) and breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435 originate from a common donor. This indicates that at some point in the past, one of these cell lines became misidentified, meaning that it ceased to correspond to the reported donor and instead became falsely identified (through cross-contamination or other means) as a cell line from a different donor. Initial studies concluded that MDA-MB-435 was the misidentified cell line and M14 was the authentic cell line, although contradictory evidence has been published, resulting in further confusion. To address this question, we obtained early samples of the melanoma cell line (M14), a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same donor (ML14), and donor serum preserved at the originator's institution. M14 samples were cryopreserved in December 1975, before MDA-MB-435 cells were established in culture. Through a series of molecular characterizations, including short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and cytogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that later samples of M14 and MDA-MB-435 correspond to samples of M14 frozen in 1975, to the lymphoblastoid cell line ML14, and to the melanoma donor's STR profile, sex and blood type. This work demonstrates conclusively that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA-MB-435 is misidentified. With clear provenance information and authentication testing of early samples, it is possible to resolve debates regarding the origins of problematic cell lines that are widely used in cancer research.

1567,2797100,The risk of breast cancer after irradiation of the thymus in infancy,"It is well established that exposure to ionizing radiation during or after puberty increases a woman's risk for breast cancer, but it is less clear whether exposure to ionizing radiation very early in life is also carcinogenic. We studied the incidence of breast cancer prospectively in a cohort of 1201 women who received x-ray treatment in infancy for an enlarged thymus gland and in their 2469 nonirradiated sisters. After an average of 36 years of follow-up, there were 22 breast cancers in the irradiated group and 12 among their sisters, yielding an adjusted rate ratio of 3.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). The estimated mean absorbed dose of radiation to the breast was 0.69 Gy. The first breast cancer was diagnosed 28 years after irradiation. The dose-response relation was linear (P less than 0.0001), with a relative risk of 3.48 for 1 Gy of radiation (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 6.2) and an additive excess risk of 5.7 per 10(4) person-years per gray (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.5). We conclude that exposure of the female breast to ionizing radiation in infancy increases the risk of breast cancer later in life.",0
1568,25238930,Morphological and phylogenetic analysis of Fusarium solani species complex in Malaysia,"Members of Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) have been known as plant, animal, and human pathogens. Nevertheless, the taxonomic status of such an important group of fungi is still very confusing and many new species as well as lineages have been elucidated recently. Unfortunately, most of the new taxa came from temperate and subtropical regions. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to identify strains of FSSC recovered from different sources in Malaysia. In the present study, 55 strains belonging to the FSSC were examined and phylogenetically analyzed on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and partial translation elongation factor-1 (TEF-1α) sequences. Based on morphological features, a total of 55 strains were selected for molecular studies. Based on morphological features, the strains were classified into four described Fusarium species, namely Fusarium keratoplasticum, Fusarium falciforme, FSSC 5, and Fusarium cf. ensiforme, and one unknown phylogenetic species was introduced. Although the data obtained from morphological and molecular studies sufficiently supported each other, the phylogenetic trees based on ITS and TEF-1α dataset clearly distinguished closely related species and distinctly separated all morphological taxa. All members of FSSC in this research were reported for the first time for Malaysian mycoflora.  ",0
1569,19580669,Prediction of localization and interactions of apoptotic proteins,"During apoptosis several mitochondrial proteins are released. Some of them participate in caspase-independent nuclear DNA degradation, especially apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (endoG). Another interesting protein, which was expected to act similarly as AIF due to the high sequence homology with AIF is AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death (AMID). We studied the structure, cellular localization, and interactions of several proteins in silico and also in cells using fluorescent microscopy. We found the AMID protein to be cytoplasmic, most probably incorporated into the cytoplasmic side of the lipid membranes. Bioinformatic predictions were conducted to analyze the interactions of the studied proteins with each other and with other possible partners. We conducted molecular modeling of proteins with unknown 3D structures. These models were then refined by MolProbity server and employed in molecular docking simulations of interactions. Our results show data acquired using a combination of modern in silico methods and image analysis to understand the localization, interactions and functions of proteins AMID, AIF, endonuclease G, and other apoptosis-related proteins.

1570,6988202,Diflunisal: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in pain and musculoskeletal strains and sprains and pain in osteoarthritis,"Diflunisal is a salicylic acid derivative with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. It has been studied in osteoarthritis, pain resulting from musculoskeketal sprains and strains and from minor surgery and cancer. The duration of its analgesic effect is longer than that of aspirin and diflunisal is effective when given twice daily. Diflunisal is not metabolised to salicylic acid and has a lesser effect than aspirin on platelet function in vivo. In osteoarthritis, diflunisal appears comparable in efficacy to moderate doses of aspirin (2 to 3g daily), but is better tolerated. It has not been compared with the most active phenylalkanoic acid derivatives such as naproxen in adequate numbers of patients. Diflunisal is comparable with glafenine in pain and with propoxyphene/paracetamol combinations and oxyphenbutazone in pain and in musculoskeletal strains and sprains. As with other non-steroidal agents, gastrointestinal complaints are the most frequently reported side effects.",1
1571,12085347,Cyclin kinase inhibitor p21 potentiates bile acid-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes that is dependent on p53,"Prolonged activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway enhances expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21 that can promote growth arrest and cell survival in response to cytotoxic insults. Bile acids can also cause prolonged MAPK activation that is cytoprotective against bile acid-induced cell death. Here, we examined the impact of bile acid-induced MAPK signaling and p21 expression on the survival of primary mouse hepatocytes. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) caused prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway that weakly enhanced p21 protein expression. When DCA-induced MAPK activation was blocked using MEK1/2 inhibitors, both hepatocyte viability and expression of p21 were reduced. Surprisingly, constitutive overexpression of p21 in p21+/+ hepatocytes enhanced DCA-induced cell killing. In agreement with these findings, treatment of p21-/- hepatocytes with DCA and MEK1/2 inhibitors also caused less apoptosis than observed in wild-type p21+/+ cells. Expression of p21 in p21-/- hepatocytes did not modify basal levels of apoptosis but restored the apoptotic response of p21-/- cells to those of p21+/+ cells overexpressing p21. These findings suggest that basal expression of p21 plays a facilitating, proapoptotic role in DCA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of p21 enhanced p53 protein levels. In agreement with a role for p53 in the enhanced apoptotic response, overexpression of p21 did not potentiate apoptosis in p53-/- hepatocytes but, instead, attenuated the death response in these cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that overexpression of p21 can promote apoptosis, leading to elevated sensitivity to proapoptotic stimuli.",0
1572,23865865,Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving Ginkgo biloba,"Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts (GLEs) are popular herbal remedies for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia, tinnitus, vertigo and peripheral arterial disease. As GLEs are taken regularly by older people who are likely to also use multiple other drugs for the treatment of, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, rheumatism or heart failure, potential herb-drug interactions are of interest. Preclinical studies of high doses/concentrations of GLEs of varying quality and standardization hinted at both an inhibition and induction of metabolic enzymes and transporters. However, in humans, positive in vitro-findings could not be replicated in vivo. At maximum recommended doses of 240 mg/day, a clinically relevant interaction potential of the standardized GLE EGb 761 could not be shown. GLE doses higher than the recommended ones led to a weak induction of the CYP2C19-mediated omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, and a weak inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, respectively. Also, the regular intake of a poorly characterized GLE at a dose of 360 mg/day slightly increased the bioavailability of talinolol, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and various organic anion-transporting polypeptides. Thus, regarding pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions, the intake of the standardized GLE, EGb 761, together with synthetic drugs appears to be safe as long as daily doses up to 240 mg are consumed. If this applies to other extracts prepared according to the European Pharmacopoeia remains uncertain. Also, a relevant potential for drug interactions cannot be excluded for poorly standardized GLEs used in many food supplements.",1

We assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib, as compared with imatinib, for the first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML. METHODS: In a multinational study, 519 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg once daily (259 patients) or imatinib at a dose of 400 mg once daily (260 patients). The primary end point was complete cytogenetic response by 12 months, confirmed on two consecutive assessments at least 28 days apart. Secondary end points, including major molecular response, were tested at a significance level of 0.0001 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: After a minimum follow-up of 12 months, the rate of confirmed complete cytogenetic response was higher with dasatinib than with imatinib (77% vs. 66%, P=0.007), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response observed on at least one assessment (83% vs. 72%, P=0.001). The rate of major molecular response was higher with dasatinib than with imatinib (46% vs. 28%, P<0.0001), and responses were achieved in a shorter time with dasatinib (P<0.0001). Progression to the accelerated or blastic phase of CML occurred in 5 patients who were receiving dasatinib (1.9%) and in 9 patients who were receiving imatinib (3.5%). The safety profiles of the two treatments were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib, administered once daily, as compared with imatinib, administered once daily, induced significantly higher and faster rates of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response. Since achieving complete cytogenetic response within 12 months has been associated with better long-term, progression-free survival, dasatinib may improve the long-term outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML.

1577,6384381,Once monthly rifampicin (1200 mg) plus daily dapsone (100 mg) and clofazimine (100 mg) in the initial treatment of lepromatous leprosy,"The therapeutic effect of rifampicin 1200 mg once monthly and 100 mg clofazimine daily for the first six months of treatment was evaluated in 30 patients of bacteriologically positive lepromatous leprosy patients. Moderate to marked clinical improvement was seen in all the patients and a very rapid bacteriological regression as indicated by the decrease in bacteriological and morphological indices of the skin within one week. Seven patients become MI negative at one month and three months and 13 at the end of nine months. Two patients became MI and BI negative at the end of six months and six at the end of nine months. These observations clearly establish the high therapeutic efficacy and practicability of the three drug regimen. Once monthly rifampicin is highly effective and well tolerated, and has many advantages like low cost, better patient compliance and reliability of the treatment. Addition of clofazimine to rifampicin and dapsone prevents the emergence of E.N.L. reactions which were seen during treatment with once monthly rifampicin and daily dapsone. This regimen is thus ideal for initial, intensive treatment of lepromatous leprosy and may help in preventing the spread of the disease and development of dapsone resistance.",1

METHODS: We followed 84,129 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study who were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at base line in 1980. Information on diet and lifestyle was updated periodically. During 14 years of follow-up, we documented 1128 major coronary events (296 deaths from coronary heart disease and 832 nonfatal infarctions). We defined subjects at low risk as those who were not currently smoking, had a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) under 25, consumed an average of at least half a drink of an alcoholic beverage per day, engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (which could include brisk walking) for at least half an hour per day, on average, and scored in the highest 40 percent of the cohort for consumption of a diet high in cereal fiber, marine n-3 fatty acids, and folate, with a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load, which reflects the extent to which diet raises blood glucose levels. RESULTS: Many of the factors were correlated, but each independently and significantly predicted risk, even after further adjustment for age, family history, presence or absence of diagnosed hypertension or diagnosed high cholesterol level, and menopausal status. Women in the low-risk category (who made up 3 percent of the population) had a relative risk of coronary events of 0.17 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.41) as compared with all the other women. Eighty-two percent of coronary events in the study cohort (95 percent confidence interval, 58 to 93 percent) could be attributed to lack of adherence to this low-risk pattern. CONCLUSION: Among women, adherence to lifestyle guidelines involving diet, exercise, and abstinence from smoking is associated with a very low risk of coronary heart disease.",0
1581,29892803,Differential expression of photosynthesis-related genes in pentaploid interspecific hybrid and its decaploid of Fragaria spp,"Polyploidization always induces a series of changes in genome, transcriptome and epigenetics, of which changes in gene expression are the immediate causes of genotype alterations of polyploid plants. In our previous study on strawberry polyploidization, genes related to photosynthesis were found to undergo changes in gene expression and DNA methylation. Therefore, we chose 11 genes that were closely related to plant photosynthesis and analysed their expression during strawberry hybridization and chromosome doubling. Most genes of pentaploids showed expression levels between parents and were more similar to F. × ananassa. Gene expression levels of decaploids were higher than those of pentaploids and F. × ananassa. Different types of photosynthesis-related genes responded differently to hybridization and chromosome doubling. Chloroplast genes and regulatory genes showed complex responses. Structural genes of the photosynthetic system were expressed at a constant level and displayed a clear dosage effect. The methylation levels of one CG site on SIGE, which regulates expression of chloroplast genes, were negatively correlated with gene expression. In pentaploids and decaploids, more transcripts were from F. × ananassa than from F. viridis. The ratio of transcripts from from F. × ananassa to those from F. viridis was close to the ratio (4:1) of the genome of F. × ananassa to that of F. viridis in pentaploids and decaploids, but there were also some exceptions with obvious deviation.

This prospective randomised controlled double-blind trial involved patients aged over 60 with diabetes mellitus and a Wagner grade I-II foot ulcer of over four weeks' duration. Patients received either 400 ml (400 kcal) oral nutritional supplementation (n = 26) or 400 ml placebo (n = 27) daily for six months. Patients were followed monthly for six months and after one and two years. A third of the patients were classified as having protein-energy malnutrition at inclusion, with no difference between the two groups. Critical leg ischaemia was more common in the intervention group than in the placebo group (p = 0.008). Nine patients in the intervention group (35%) and four in the placebo group (15%) dropped out of the study (not significant). Of those who completed the study, the wound had healed at six months in eight out of 23 patients (41%) (placebo) and in seven out of 17 (35%) (intervention) (not significant). Twenty-four per cent of patients with protein-energy malnutrition at inclusion had healed at six months compared with 50% of those without it (not significant).

The present study was investigated to evaluate the effects of allium cepa on renal failur in male rats which experimentally infected by Toxoplasma gondii, RH strain. Wistar male rat (n=40) were allocated into four groups, group one that received tachyzoites of T. gondii (ip) (n=10), group two that received tachyzoites of T. gondii (ip), plus fresh onion juice by gavages method (n=10), group three received just fresh onion juice by gavages method (n=10) and control group (n=10) that received nothing. Animals were kept in standard condition. In 30 day after inducing Toxoplasma infection, 5cc blood was collected for serum protein and TAC levels. Kidney tissues of Rat in whole groups were removed and prepared for apopetosis analysis. Serum protein and kidneys weights were significantly decreased in groups that were infected with T. gondii, in comparison to control and onions groups. Kidneys Apopetosis in toxoplasma group significantly increased in comparison to control group (P<0.05).level of TAC was significantly increased in groups that received onio juice (P<0.05). This study showed that T. gondii have significantly effect on serum protein and TAC, apopetosis and fresh onion juice returned and treated this harmful effect, so it is suggested that eating of onion is useful in toxoplasma infection.

The electrocardiograms of 338 residents from three villages (Dayao, Ninglang, Heqing) with high incidence of unexplained sudden deaths and one control village (Dali) were analyzed [averaged age was (33.4 +/- 11.7) years, 175 men and 163 women]. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was similar low in all groups. The left ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 34.6% of residents from Dayao. QTc significantly prolonged in the residents from all 3 high incidence areas compare the control area of Dali [control (386.8 +/- 27.22) ms, Ninglang (428.92 +/- 25.71) ms, Heqing (440.67 +/- 28.03) ms, Dayao (417.7 +/- 24.00) ms, P < 0.05 vs. control]. Incidence of U wave was significantly higher in Heqing village than that in control village (P < 0.05). The QUc of these 3 villages was: (613.67 +/- 37.34) ms, (597.19 +/- 46.47) ms, (608.59 +/- 39.59) ms respectively, and also significantly longer than the control village of Dali (589.33 +/- 41.27) ms (P < 0.05). The typical pattern of U wave presents as enlarged U wave and apparent T-U complex. In the 7 residents who have the family history of unexplained sudden death, 6 residents have U wave, and 4 of them present typical U wave pattern. The significant ECG changes in villages with high incidence of unexplained sudden death in Yunnan province were prolonged QTc, enlarged U wave and apparent T-U complex and these ECG features suggested the repolarization abnormalities of the heart in these subjects.

1589,24995704,Involvement of two distinct signalling pathways in IGF-1-mediated central control of hypotensive effects in normotensive and hypertensive rats,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is abundantly expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). In a previous study, we revealed that the induction of nitric oxide (NO) production in the NTS reduces blood pressure (BP). It is well known that both acute administration and chronic administration of IGF-I reduce BP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term hypotensive effect of IGF-1 in the NTS and to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms of IGF-1 in the NTS of normotensive WKY rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Microinjections of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and the MAP kinase-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 into the NTS in WKY rats and SHRs were used to study the involvement of IGF-1-induced depressor effects. An IGF-1 (7.7 pmol) injection into the NTS resulted in a significant decrease in BP and HR in WKY rats and SHRs. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the microinjection of LY294002 (0.6 pmol) or PD98059 (3.0 pmol) into the NTS attenuated the IGF-1-induced depressor effects and Akt or ERK phosphorylation in WKY rats. An attenuation effect of LY294002, but not PD98059, was found in the SHRs. However, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the IGF-1R showed no significant differences in the NTS of the WKY rats and the SHRs. These results suggest that distinct Akt and ERK signalling pathways mediated the IGF-1 control of the central depressor effects in WKY rats and SHRs. ERK signalling defects may be associated with the development of hypertension. ",0
1590,28931025,"The clinical and microbiological characteristics of enteric fever in Cambodia, 2008-2015","Enteric fever remains a major public health problem in low resource settings and antibiotic resistance is increasing. In Asia, an increasing proportion of infections is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, which for a long time was assumed to cause a milder clinical syndrome compared to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. A retrospective chart review study was conducted of 254 unique cases of blood culture confirmed enteric fever who presented at a referral adult hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia between 2008 and 2015. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from clinical charts and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. Whole genome sequence analysis was performed on a subset of 121 isolates. One-hundred-and-ninety unique patients were diagnosed with Salmonella Paratyphi A and 64 with Salmonella Typhi. In the period 2008-2012, Salmonella Paratyphi A comprised 25.5% of 47 enteric fever cases compared to 86.0% of 207 cases during 2013-2015. Presenting symptoms were identical for both serovars but higher median leukocyte counts (6.8 x 109/L vs. 6.3 x 109/L; p = 0.035) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values (47.0 mg/L vs. 36 mg/L; p = 0.034) were observed for Salmonella Typhi infections. All but one of the Salmonella Typhi isolates belonged to haplotype H58 associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) (i.e. resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole).;42.9% actually displayed MDR compared to none of the Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates. Decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) was observed in 96.9% (62/64) of Salmonella Typhi isolates versus 11.5% (21/183) of Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates (all but one from 2015). All isolates were susceptible to azithromycin and ceftriaxone. In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Salmonella Paratyphi A now causes the majority of enteric fever cases and decreased susceptibility against ciprofloxacin is increasing. Overall, Salmonella Typhi was significantly more associated with MDR and DCS compared to Salmonella Paratyphi A. ",0
1591,27332904,A Worldwide Map of Plasmodium falciparum K13-Propeller Polymorphisms,"BACKGROUND: Recent gains in reducing the global burden of malaria are threatened by the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinins. The discovery that mutations in portions of a P. falciparum gene encoding kelch (K13)-propeller domains are the major determinant of resistance has provided opportunities for monitoring such resistance on a global scale. METHODS: We analyzed the K13-propeller sequence polymorphism in 14,037 samples collected in 59 countries in which malaria is endemic. Most of the samples (84.5%) were obtained from patients who were treated at sentinel sites used for nationwide surveillance of antimalarial resistance. We evaluated the emergence and dissemination of mutations by haplotyping neighboring loci. RESULTS: We identified 108 nonsynonymous K13 mutations, which showed marked geographic disparity in their frequency and distribution. In Asia, 36.5% of the K13 mutations were distributed within two areas--one in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos and the other in western Thailand, Myanmar, and China--with no overlap. In Africa, we observed a broad array of rare nonsynonymous mutations that were not associated with delayed parasite clearance. The gene-edited Dd2 transgenic line with the A578S mutation, which expresses the most frequently observed African allele, was found to be susceptible to artemisinin in vitro on a ring-stage survival assay. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of artemisinin resistance was found outside Southeast Asia and China, where resistance-associated K13 mutations were confined. The common African A578S allele was not associated with clinical or in vitro resistance to artemisinin, and many African mutations appear to be neutral.

1592,23831889,Tumor and transplantation],"Tumor treatment and transplantation-associated with unavoidable mandatory immunosuppression-appear to be unreconcilable opposites. The clinical reality shows, however, that transplantation in many early stage primary tumors is the most effective treatment. The essential immunosuppression after transplantation can however promote tumor recurrence. Immunosuppression also leads to a significant increased rate of de novo tumors-in all organ transplant recipients. However, not all immunosuppressant drugs have the same effect on tumors. In experimental and clinical settings, the class of mTOR inhibitors has a clear antitumoral effect and is recommended as the immunosuppression treatment of choice in patients with increased tumor risk. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with the scientific background regarding the clinical problem of tumors and transplantation.  ",0
1593,10369084,Analyzing prognostic factors in breast cancer using a multistate model,"In breast cancer clinical research, an important goal is to analyze how factors are seen to affect the disease process. Meanwhile, the disease progression is not fully modelled using standard analysis since transitions between intermediate events such as local-regional recurrences (LRR) or metachronous contralateral breast cancer (MCBC) are not considered. In the present study, the progression of disease was modelled using a multistate model. By this approach, we assessed transitions during the course of the disease and studied prognostic factors for each transition. The model was applied to 6,185 patients with unilateral ductal invasive breast cancer, clinical stage I through III, treated between 1981 and 1988 at the Curie Institute. At first diagnosis, high clinical stage, high histological grade, positive lymph nodes, and age less than 40 years were associated with increased risks of LRR, metastases, or death. Except age, the same factors remained predictive for metastases or death following LRR. Chemotherapy for the first cancer was associated with a decreased risk for developing MCBC. As the time interval from diagnosis of the primary tumor to that of a local or contralateral recurrence increased, the risk of metastases or death decreased. Nodal status for the first tumor and clinical stage for the contralateral tumor increased the risk of metastases or death following MCBC. Conversely, the risk decreased for patients who received adjuvant hormone therapy following MCBC. In conclusion, the multistate model offers us a much more appropriate way to study prognostic factors for each transition in breast cancer disease. ",0
1594,8175136,The Canadian Multicenter Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis,"""Ursodeoxycholic acid, a dihydroxyl bile acid normally present in human beings in minimal amounts, becomes incorporated into the bile salt pool when taken orally. In cholestasis, bile acids are retained in the liver and are hepatotoxic. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the least-known hepatotoxic bile acid, has choleretic properties and is reported to benefit patients with chronic cholestasis. In a nationwide Canadian controlled trial, 222 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (14 mg/kg/body wt/day) or placebo for 24 mo. Only patients with a diagnosis confirmed by liver biopsy and serum positive for antimitochondrial antibodies were enrolled; 88% were symptomatic on entry. The primary outcome measure was percent change in total serum bilirubin from baseline to final follow-up. Treated patients (111) and controls (111) were comparable with regard to age, gender, biochemical parameters and liver histological condition. Although treatment was not associated with any improvement in symptoms, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy caused the bilirubin to fall significantly within the first 3 mo of therapy (p < 0.001). Significant falls in serum alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases, cholesterol and IgM levels were also noted in the treated group. Improvement in some histological features was observed but there was no difference between the groups in the number of patients who reached the endpoints of death or liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid, given to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, leads to an improvement in serum markers of cholestasis. A larger sample size is needed to determine whether ursodeoxycholic acid therapy has a beneficial effect on the survival of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.""",1

Leucovorin was increased twofold and trimetrexate reduced by 50% or suspended briefly for various levels of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia until blood counts increased. Dosage-modifying hematologic toxicity occurred in 12 (46%), 8 (80%), 9 (75%), and 4 (67%) patients with the respective groups. Cytopenias were in each case reversible and other toxicities were well tolerated. All survivors but one were able to receive a full 21 doses of trimetrexate. Twenty-four (92%), 10 (100%), 7 (58%), and 4 (80%) of patients in the respective groups survived. Thus, the 45 mg/m2/day dosage of trimetrexate with 80 mg/m2/day of leucovorin resulted in the least dosage-modifying toxicity and excellent efficacy. This combination should be selected for studies to compare trimetrexate with other therapies for pneumocystis pneumonia.""",1

1598,15051668,p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase contributes to the diminished aortic contraction by endothelin-1 in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats,"We investigated whether the diminished contractile responsiveness to endothelin-1 (ET-1) is associated with the altered activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in aortic smooth muscles from deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. ET-1 dose-dependently increased contractions in aortic smooth muscle strips, and the contractions were significantly attenuated in tissues from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with those from sham-operated rats. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was elevated by ET-1, with the magnitude and time-course being similar between strips. Although ET-1 also increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in both strips, the increment was markedly lower in the strips from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with sham-operated controls. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) increased vascular contraction and phosphorylation of both MAPK isoforms; these were greater in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats than in sham-operated rats. ET-1 also increased the phosphorylation of caldesmon, an actin-binding protein, in sham-operated and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. However, the increment was markedly lower in the strips from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with sham-operated controls. The phosphorylation of MAPK isoforms and caldesmon elevated by ET-1 was inhibited by PD098059, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 kinase, and SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, respectively. These results suggest that ET-1 and 5-HT induce contraction by activating the MAPK pathway in rat aortic smooth muscle and that the diminished responsiveness to ET-1 in the DOCA-salt hypertensive rat may be, in part, mediated by the decrease of caldesmon phosphorylation after the decreased activation of p38 MAPK.

The swallowing mechanism changes with increasing age, therefore the impact of a NGT on swallowing in elderly individuals is likely to be different but is not yet known. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of NGTs of different diameter on (1) airway penetration-aspiration, (2) pharyngeal residue, and (3) pharyngeal transit, in older healthy subjects. Randomized controlled crossover design. Healthy elderly volunteers underwent 3 modified barium swallow studies in which multiple diet and fluid consistencies were swallowed under the following conditions: (A) no NGT (control), (B) fine bore NGT, and (C) wide bore NGT. The control condition was assessed first to establish baseline swallowing function, then NGT order was randomly allocated. Of the 15 volunteers (median age 65 years, range 60-81) complete data sets were obtained for 9 (4 with allocation order ABC; 5 with ACB). Wide bore NGT data could not be obtained for 6 volunteers mainly due to tube intolerance. The presence of a NGT was associated with: (i) an increase in airway penetration-aspiration (fine bore NGT with serial liquid swallows and puree) (p < 0.01); (ii) increased pharyngeal residue (p < 0.05) in the pyriform sinus (fine bore NGT with puree); and in the valleculae (both fine and wide bore NGT with soft solids); and (iii) an increase in pharyngeal transit duration regardless of consistency (p < 0.01), with longest swallowing durations with the widest tube. NGT presence increases airway penetration-aspiration, pharyngeal residue and prolongs transit through the pharynx in older healthy individuals. Consideration of NGT impact on swallowing during concurrent oral and enteral feeding is recommended, with further systematic investigation required in elderly patients recovering from critical illness.

They can be divided into four subgroups according to their genotype/phenotype features. (1) Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) biallelic somatic mutations are observed in 35% of the HCA cases. It occurs in almost all cases in women. HNF1alpha-mutated HCA are most of the time, highly steatotic, with a lack of expression of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) in immunohistochemistry analyses. Adenomatosis is frequently detected in this context. An HNF1alpha germline mutation is observed in less than 5% of HCA cases and can be associated with MODY 3 diabetes. (2) An activating beta-catenin mutation was found in 10% of HCA. These beta-catenin activated HCAs are observed in men and women, and specific risk factors, such as male hormone administration or glycogenosis, are associated with their development. Immunohistochemistry studies show that these HCAs overexpress beta-catenin (nuclear and cytoplasmic) and glutamine synthetase. This group of tumours has a higher risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. (3) Inflammatory HCAs are observed in 40% of the cases, and they are most frequent in women but are also found in men. Lesions are characterised by inflammatory infiltrates, dystrophic arteries, sinusoidal dilatation and ductular reaction. They express serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein. In this group, GGT is frequently elevated, with a biological inflammatory syndrome present. Also, there are more overweight patients in this group. An additional 10% of inflammatory HCAs express beta-catenin, and are also at risk of malignant transformation. (4) Currently, less than 10% of HCAs are unclassified. It is hoped that in the near future it will be possible with clinical, biological and imaging data to predict in which of the 2 major groups (HNF1alpha-mutated HCA and inflammatory HCA) the patient belongs and to propose better guidelines in terms of surveillance and treatment.",1

It has been reported that MO causes a decrease in in vivo mitochondrial enzyme activity similar to that seen in Reye's syndrome. We have attempted to uncover some of the biochemical mechanisms of MO's toxicity by examining its effect in vitro on isolated rat liver mitochondria. Male rat liver mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation; oxygen uptake, reduced forms of cytochrome b, c + c1, a + a3, and flavoprotein, intramitochondrial concentrations of acetyl coA, acid-soluble coA, acid-insoluble coA, and ATP content were measured after incubation with and without MO. Our results reveal that MO is a mitochondrial uncoupler. State 4 respiration was increased while the respiratory control ratio was decreased. The intramitochondrial content of ATP was also decreased. There were substantial changes in the reduction of the respiratory chain components after incubation of mitochondria with MO. This decelerative effect on mitochondrial electron transport was alleviated by the addition of coenzyme Q and/or carnitine. These effects of MO on mitochondrial respiration may be due to changes in fatty acid metabolism caused by MO as MO caused a shift in the proportion of acid-soluble or acid-insoluble coA esters. Supplementary therapy with L-carnitine and coenzyme Q may be useful in the management of MO-induced Reye's syndrome.""",1

These can cause significant morbidity and compromise tuberculosis treatment regimens. AIM: To determine the incidence and severity of and risk factors for major adverse reactions to antituberculosis drugs in in-hospital patients treated for active tuberculosis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical records of patients admitted to Pulido Valente Hospital (Pulmonology Unit III) with active TB treated with anti-tuberculosis agents April 1999 to July 2007. Adverse reactions resulting in modification or discontinuation of treatment or hospital admission were recorded. Patients' demographic characteristics and clinical data were used as independent variables. The relationship between independent variables and the frequency and severity of AR was studied using multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model. The data were analysed using the Student t test, one-way ANOVA and logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 15.0. RESULTS: We recorded 1400 in-hospital patients treated for active TB 1999 to 2007, of which 175 patients (12.5%), 118 male and 57 female, had at least one AR induced by antituberculosis agents, to a total of 192 events. Hepatotoxicity was the most prevalent AR (83/47.4%), followed by skin reactions (55/31.4%) and gastrointestinal intolerance (24/13.7%). In 76 patients (43.4%) AR caused prolonged hospital stay. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed in the average hospital stay (58.4 days for patients with AR and 26 days for patients without AR). Isoniazid (62.2%) and rifampicin (51.9%) were the most frequently implicated drugs. It was possible to characterise the AR severity in 134 cases. In 106 cases (79%) AR resulted in discontinuation of the drug. The relationship between drug and AR was definitive in 23 cases (17%). Of the 13 patients (9.6%) who died, AR was directly implicated in the cause of death in six (4.4%). AR were associated with alcoholism (relative risk [RR] 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-7.9) and CD4 levels < 350 cells/mm(3) (RR 2.6; CI 1.4-5). In the predictive model, hepatic reactions were associated with viral hepatitis B and/or C (RR 2.5, CI; 1.2-5.1) and that CD4 levels < 350 cells/mm(3) (RR5.5; CI 1.6-18.6). CONCLUSIONS: Antituberculosis drugs are associated with a significant number of AR that can cause significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and even death. Our results show that alcoholism and levels of CD4 < 350 cells/mm(3) were significantly associated with a high risk of AR and hepatitis B and C and levels of CD4 < 350 cells/mm3 were also significantly associated with hepatotoxicity.""",1

The women, all residents in the Denver area, probably acted independently and did not seek advice from a common source. The women's nonuse of the local physician was not due to ignorance or nonavailability of abortion services, but seems to be part of a relatively widespread move away from conventional medicine. Needless to say, herbal preparation can be very harmful, and the public should be continually educated regarding the most popular forms of self-treatment.",1

1614,19575051,Clinical evaluation of polyamide polymer burs for selective carious dentin removal,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the carious dentin removal efficacy of new rotary polyamide burs capable of selectively removing infected dentin without removing sound dentin. This study included 40 subjects with bilateral occlusal carious lesions on mandibular first permanent molars. The lesions were randomly assigned to receive one restoration after carious dentin removal with a polymer bur and the second after removal of carious dentin with a carbon steel round bur. Both procedures were completed by a single operator in one appointment. The efficacy of caries removal, time taken for caries removal, and patients' perception of the treatment were evaluated. The restorations were evaluated immediately and after six months using intraoral periapical radiographs (IOPA). The results revealed statistically significant differences between the polymer burs and carbon steel burs with respect to caries removal efficacy (p<0.001) and the time taken for caries removal (p<0.001). No statistically significant results were obtained regarding patients' perception of the treatment and longevity of the restorations. Carbon steel round burs remove caries lesions more efficiently than polymer burs but they tend to contribute to the over-preparation of the cavity. Polyamide burs were found to be self-limiting and lose their cutting efficiency on reaching affected dentin and do not cut sound dentin. The time required for caries removal using the polymer bur was significantly longer than when using a carbon steel round bur. One of the goals of conservative dentistry is to develop a method for removing caries-infected dentin while preserving caries-unaffected dentin. The use of polymer burs appears to offer a straightforward and efficient means for achieving this goal and conserving healthy tooth structure. ",0

1616,22895139,First-line gefitinib in patients aged 75 or older with advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor mutations: NEJ 003 study,"""INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have demonstrated that first-line treatment with gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is significantly superior to standard chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR sensitive mutations. Meanwhile, the efficacy of gefitinib therapy among elderly populations diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of gefitinib for chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 or older with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations; generally, these patients have no indication for treatment with platinum doublets. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 years or older with performance status 0 to 1 and advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, as determined by the peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method, were enrolled. The enrolled patients received 250 mg/day of gefitinib orally. RESULTS: Between January 2008 and May 2009, 31 patients were enrolled, all of whom were eligible. The median age was 80 (range, 75-87) years. Twenty-five patients (81%) were women, and 30 patients (97%) had adenocarcinoma. The overall response rate was 74% (95% confidence interval, 58%-91%), and the disease control rate was 90%. The median progression-free survival was 12.3 months. The common adverse events were rash, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction. One treatment-related death because of interstitial lung disease occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that verified safety and efficacy of first-line treatment with gefitinib in elderly patients having advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation. Considering its strong antitumor activity and mild toxicity, first-line gefitinib may be preferable to standard chemotherapy for this population.""",1
1617,10706571,Inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA-dependent translation and replication of a chimeric HCV poliovirus using synthetic stabilized ribozymes,"Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules that can be designed to cleave specific RNA sequences. To investigate the potential use of synthetic stabilized ribozymes for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we designed and synthesized hammerhead ribozymes targeting 15 conserved sites in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of HCV RNA. This region forms an internal ribosome entry site that allows for efficient translation of the HCV polyprotein. The 15 synthetic ribozymes contained modified nucleotides and linkages that stabilize the molecules against nuclease degradation. All 15 ribozymes were tested for their ability to reduce expression in an HCV 5' UTR/luciferase reporter system and for their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV-poliovirus (HCV-PV) chimera. Treatment with several ribozymes resulted in significant down-regulation of HCV 5' UTR/luciferase reporter expression (range 40% to 80% inhibition, P <.05). Moreover, several ribozymes showed significant inhibition (>90%, P <.001) of chimeric HCV-PV replication. We further show that the inhibitory activity of ribozymes targeting site 195 of HCV RNA exhibits a sequence-specific dose response, requires an active catalytic ribozyme core, and is dependent on the presence of the HCV 5' UTR. Treatment with synthetic stabilized anti-HCV ribozymes has the potential to aid patients who are infected with HCV by reducing the viral burden through specific targeting and cleavage of the viral genome.",0

1619,24885479,Clinical experience with ipilimumab 3�mg/kg: real-world efficacy and safety data from an expanded access programme cohort,"BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab improves survival in patients with advanced melanoma. The activity and safety of ipilimumab outside of a clinical trial was assessed in an expanded access programme (EAP). METHODS: Ipilimumab was available upon physician request for patients aged 16 or over with pretreated stage III (unresectable)/IV melanoma, for whom no other therapeutic option was available. Patients received ipilimumab 3�mg/kg every 3�weeks for four doses. Patients with stable disease or an objective response to ipilimumab were eligible for retreatment upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted at baseline and week 12. Patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs) within 3 to 4�days of each scheduled visit. RESULTS: Of 855 patients participating in the EAP in Italy, 833 were evaluable for response. Of these, 13% had an objective immune response, and the immune-related disease control rate was 34%. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.7 and 7.2�months, respectively. Efficacy was independent of BRAF and NRAS mutational status. Overall, 33% of patients reported an immune-related AE (irAE). The frequency of irAEs was not associated with response to ipilimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Outside of a clinical trial setting, ipilimumab is a feasible treatment option in patients with pretreated metastatic melanoma, regardless of BRAF and NRAS mutational status. Data from this large cohort of patients support clinical trial evidence that ipilimumab can induce durable disease control and long-term survival in patients who have failed to respond to prior treatment.",1
1620,30345907,MUC5B Promoter Variant and Rheumatoid Arthritis with Interstitial Lung Disease,"BACKGROUND: Given the phenotypic similarities between rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) (hereafter, RA-ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we hypothesized that the strongest risk factor for the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the gain-of-function MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950, would also contribute to the risk of ILD among patients with RA. METHODS: Using a discovery population and multiple validation populations, we tested the association of the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 in 620 patients with RA-ILD, 614 patients with RA without ILD, and 5448 unaffected controls. RESULTS: Analysis of the discovery population revealed an association of the minor allele of the MUC5B promoter variant with RA-ILD when patients with RA-ILD were compared with unaffected controls (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 5.2; P=9.7�10(-17)). The MUC5B promoter variant was also significantly overrepresented among patients with RA-ILD, as compared with unaffected controls, in an analysis of the multiethnic case series (adjusted odds ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.2 to 7.3; P=4.7�10(-35)) and in a combined analysis of the discovery population and the multiethnic case series (adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.9 to 5.8; P=1.3�10(-49)). In addition, the MUC5B promoter variant was associated with an increased risk of ILD among patients with RA (adjusted odds ratio in combined analysis, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 5.4; P=7.4�10(-5)), particularly among those with evidence of usual interstitial pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography (adjusted odds ratio in combined analysis, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 13.1; P=2.5�10(-6)). However, no significant association with the MUC5B promoter variant was observed for the diagnosis of RA alone. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the MUC5B promoter variant was associated with RA-ILD and more specifically associated with evidence of usual interstitial pneumonia on imaging.

1621,19285617,Quilty effect correlates with biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection but does not predict transplanted heart coronary artery vasculopathy,"The appropriate therapy after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is determined by the results of endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs). The Quilty effect (QE) is a recognized cause of discrepancies in EMB grading, but its clinical implications remain unclear. In this study we assess the correlation of the QE with biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (AR) and coronary artery vasculopathy (CAV). We reassessed 5,361 EMB samples, obtained from 429 patients, based on QE occurrence and its impact on EMB score. Next, we divided all patients with at least 1 year of follow-up into two groups: a QE(+) group (n = 202, 58.7% of sample, 172 males/30 females, 44.8 +/- 12 years of age) and a QE(-) group (n = 142, 41.3% of sample, 124 males/18 females, 45.4 +/- 12 years of age), and compared AR and CAV occurrences. The QE was observed in 669 EMBs (12.5%), and at least 1 EMB with QE was found among the 231 patients (53.8%). The initial QE occurrence took place during the first 3 months after OHT in 68% of QE(+) patients, and >1 year post-OHT in 13% of patients. The average EMB score was significantly higher in QE(+) biopsies. A comparison of the two groups revealed a significantly higher number of AR episodes and number of patients with at least one episode of AR in QE(+) patients. There was no significant difference in number of CAV occurrences between groups. The QE seems to be a marker of the same increased immune system activity that can lead to AR. A relationship between QE and CAV was not supported by the present results. ",0
1622,18832244,Maraviroc for previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection,"BACKGROUND: CC chemokine receptor 5 antagonists are a new class of antiretroviral agents. METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies--Maraviroc versus Optimized Therapy in Viremic Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Patients (MOTIVATE) 1 and MOTIVATE 2--with patients who had R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) only. They had been treated with or had resistance to three antiretroviral-drug classes and had HIV-1 RNA levels of more than 5000 copies per milliliter. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three antiretroviral regimens consisting of maraviroc once daily, maraviroc twice daily, or placebo, each of which included optimized background therapy (OBT) based on treatment history and drug-resistance testing. Safety and efficacy were assessed after 48 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 1049 patients received the randomly assigned study drug; the mean baseline HIV-1 RNA level was 72,400 copies per milliliter, and the median CD4 cell count was 169 per cubic millimeter. At 48 weeks, in both studies, the mean change in HIV-1 RNA from baseline was greater with maraviroc than with placebo: -1.66 and -1.82 log(10) copies per milliliter with the once-daily and twice-daily regimens, respectively, versus -0.80 with placebo in MOTIVATE 1, and -1.72 and -1.87 log(10) copies per milliliter, respectively, versus -0.76 with placebo in MOTIVATE 2. More patients receiving maraviroc once or twice daily had HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter (42% and 47%, respectively, vs. 16% in the placebo group in MOTIVATE 1; 45% in both maraviroc groups vs. 18% in MOTIVATE 2; P<0.001 for both comparisons in each study). The change from baseline in CD4 counts was also greater with maraviroc once or twice daily than with placebo (increases of 113 and 122 per cubic millimeter, respectively, vs. 54 in MOTIVATE 1; increases of 122 and 128 per cubic millimeter, respectively, vs. 69 in MOTIVATE 2; P<0.001 for both comparisons in each study). Frequencies of adverse events were similar among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Maraviroc, as compared with placebo, resulted in significantly greater suppression of HIV-1 and greater increases in CD4 cell counts at 48 weeks in previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 who were receiving OBT.

1626,25414651,Addiction and reward-related genes show altered expression in the postpartum nucleus accumbens,"Motherhood involves a switch in natural rewards, whereby offspring become highly rewarding. Nucleus accumbens (NAC) is a key CNS region for natural rewards and addictions, but to date no study has evaluated on a large scale the events in NAC that underlie the maternal change in natural rewards. In this study we utilized microarray and bioinformatics approaches to evaluate postpartum NAC gene expression changes in mice. Modular Single-set Enrichment Test (MSET) indicated that postpartum (relative to virgin) NAC gene expression profile was significantly enriched for genes related to addiction and reward in five of five independently curated databases (e.g., Malacards, Phenopedia). Over 100 addiction/reward related genes were identified and these included: Per1, Per2, Arc, Homer2, Creb1, Grm3, Fosb, Gabrb3, Adra2a, Ntrk2, Cry1, Penk, Cartpt, Adcy1, Npy1r, Htr1a, Drd1a, Gria1, and Pdyn. ToppCluster analysis found maternal NAC expression profile to be significantly enriched for genes related to the drug action of nicotine, ketamine, and dronabinol. Pathway analysis indicated postpartum NAC as enriched for RNA processing, CNS development/differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified possible networks for transcription factors, including Nr1d1, Per2, Fosb, Egr1, and Nr4a1. The postpartum state involves increased risk for mental health disorders and MSET analysis indicated postpartum NAC to be enriched for genes related to depression, bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia. Mental health related genes included: Fabp7, Grm3, Penk, and Nr1d1. We confirmed via quantitative PCR Nr1d1, Per2, Grm3, Penk, Drd1a, and Pdyn. This study indicates for the first time that postpartum NAC involves large scale gene expression alterations linked to addiction and reward. Because the postpartum state also involves decreased response to drugs, the findings could provide insights into how to mitigate addictions.  ",0
1627,25406093,Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase produces the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate,"Human d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the first enzyme in the serine biosynthetic pathway, is genomically amplified in tumors including breast cancer and melanoma. In PHGDH-amplified cancer cells, knockdown of PHGDH is not fully rescued by exogenous serine, suggesting possible additional growth-promoting roles for the enzyme. Here we show that, in addition to catalyzing oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate, PHGDH catalyzes NADH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate (AKG) to the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG). Knockdown of PHGDH decreased cellular 2HG by approximately 50% in the PHGDH-amplified breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 (normal concentration 93 μM) and BT-20 (normal concentration 35 μM) and overexpression of PHGDH increased cellular 2HG by over 2-fold in non-PHGDH-amplified MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which normally display very low PHGDH expression. The reduced 2HG level in PHGDH knockdown cell lines can be rescued by PHGDH re-expression, but not by a catalytically inactive PHGDH mutant. The initial connection between cancer and d-2HG involved production of high levels of d-2HG by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase. More recently, however, elevated d-2HG has been observed in breast cancer tumors without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation. Our results suggest that PHGDH is one source of this d-2HG.  ",0

1629,30753169,Systematic testing and specificity mapping of alloantigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors in regulatory T cells,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology can be used to engineer the antigen specificity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and improve their potency as an adoptive cell therapy in multiple disease models. As synthetic receptors, CARs carry the risk of immunogenicity, particularly when derived from nonhuman antibodies. Using an HLA-A*02:01-specific CAR (A2-CAR) encoding a single-chain variable fragment (Fv) derived from a mouse antibody, we developed a panel of 20 humanized A2-CARs (hA2-CARs). Systematic testing demonstrated variations in expression, and ability to bind HLA-A*02:01 and stimulate human Treg suppression in vitro. In addition, we developed a new method to comprehensively map the alloantigen specificity of CARs, revealing that humanization reduced HLA-A cross-reactivity. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed rapid trafficking and persistence of hA2-CAR Tregs in A2-expressing allografts, with eventual migration to draining lymph nodes. Adoptive transfer of hA2-CAR Tregs suppressed HLA-A2+ cell-mediated xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease and diminished rejection of human HLA-A2+ skin allografts. These data provide a platform for systematic development and specificity testing of humanized alloantigen-specific CARs that can be used to engineer specificity and homing of therapeutic Tregs. ",0

Formation of the urea inclusion compound was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The modified Zimmerschied calorimetric method was used to estimate the minimum amount of RAE required for adduction of enalapril maleate in urea. Urea-enalapril maleate-RAE inclusion compounds containing varying proportions of guests were prepared and their thermal behaviour studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Regression analysis revealed an excellent r(2) value with regard to the influence of the relative proportion of RAE on the heat of decomposition. The inclusion compounds were found to exhibit good content uniformity and improved dissolution profile as demonstrated by increased dissolution efficiency. Studies revealed that urea inclusion may be a promising alternative for the formulation of potent poorly soluble drugs into immediate release products. ",0
1634,20818845,Underinsurance among children in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Recent interest in policy regarding children's health insurance has focused on expanding coverage. Less attention has been devoted to the question of whether insurance sufficiently meets children's needs. METHODS: We estimated underinsurance among U.S. children on the basis of data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (sample size, 91,642 children) regarding parents' or guardians' judgments of whether their children's insurance covered needed services and providers and reasonably covered costs. Data on adequacy were combined with data on continuity of insurance coverage to classify children as never insured during the past year, sometimes insured during the past year, continuously insured but inadequately covered (i.e., underinsured), and continuously insured and adequately covered. We examined the association between this classification and five overall indicators of health care access and quality: delayed or forgone care, difficulty obtaining needed care from a specialist, no preventive care, no developmental screening at a preventive visit, and care not meeting the criteria of a medical home. RESULTS: We estimated that in 2007, 11 million children were without health insurance for all or part of the year, and 22.7% of children with continuous insurance coverage--14.1 million children--were underinsured. Older children, Hispanic children, children in fair or poor health, and children with special health care needs were more likely to be underinsured. As compared with children who were continuously and adequately insured, uninsured and underinsured children were more likely to have problems with health care access and quality. CONCLUSIONS: The number of underinsured children exceeded the number of children without insurance for all or part of the year studied. Access to health care and the quality of health care are suboptimal for uninsured and underinsured children. (Funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration.)",0

The significance of this study is related to the potential health effects this agent might produce in those consumers who have an allergic response to Penicillin. It has been estimated that between 6% and 8% of the American population is subject to this type of allergic response. A method is developed for the detection of penicillin in wines using high-pressure liquid chromatography. We demonstrate that penicillin G hydrolyzes rapidly in wine with first-order kinetics, and the half-life of this antibiotic is 147 min in a typical commercial wine. An analysis of a number of commercial wines shows no evidence of the presence of penicillin, which should negate the question of any allergic response associated with this potential contaminate. ",0

However, the well-documented ability of the transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX-1) to activate pancreatic lineage development and insulin production following ectopic expression in liver suggests a surprising degree of residual plasticity in adult liver cells. This study seeks a mechanistic explanation for the capacity of PDX-1 to endow liver cells with pancreatic characteristics and function. We demonstrate that PDX-1, previously shown to play an essential role in normal pancreatic organogenesis and pancreatic beta-cell function and to possess the potential to activate multiple pancreatic markers in liver, can also direct hepatic dedifferentiation. PDX-1 represses the adult hepatic repertoire of gene expression and activates the expression of the immature hepatic marker alpha-fetoprotein. We present evidence indicating that PDX-1 triggers hepatic dedifferentiation by repressing the key hepatic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta. Hepatic dedifferentiation is necessary though not sufficient for the activation of the mature pancreatic repertoire in liver. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a dual role for PDX-1 in liver: inducing hepatic dedifferentiation and activating the pancreatic lineage.

A 59-year-old, Caucasian male presented with ALF 34 days after receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate. Despite aggressive supportive care, he died on hospital day 10. A 42-year-old, Caucasian female presented with ALF 21 days after receiving amoxicillin. She underwent successful liver transplantation on hospital day 19. In both cases, all competing causes of ALF had been excluded, liver pathology was consistent with drug-induced hepatitis, and cases were deemed """"definite/highly probable"""" using causality assessment. Amongst 14 prior ALF/death cases due to amoxicillin/clavulanate, the mean age (62 years), male predominance (57%), and mean delay from drug cessation to presentation (17 days) is similar to what has been reported in patients with self-limited cholestatic hepatitis. Acute liver failure is a rare manifestation of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate hepatotoxicity with no obvious clinical features at presentation portending a poor prognosis. Early transfer of patients with severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity (i.e., encephalopathy or coagulopathy) to a transplant center is recommended due to their poor likelihood of recovery.""",1

1641,12637607,Factors associated with the development of peanut allergy in childhood,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peanut allergy appears to have increased in recent decades. Other than a family history of peanut allergy and the presence of atopy, there are no known risk factors. METHODS: We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a geographically defined cohort study of 13,971 preschool children, to identify those with a convincing history of peanut allergy and the subgroup that reacted to a double-blind peanut challenge. We first prospectively collected data on the whole cohort and then collected detailed information retrospectively by interview from the parents of children with peanut reactions and of children from two groups of controls (a random sample from the cohort and a group of children whose mothers had a history of eczema and who had had eczema themselves in the first six months of life). RESULTS: Forty-nine children had a history of peanut allergy; peanut allergy was confirmed by peanut challenge in 23 of 36 children tested. There was no evidence of prenatal sensitization from the maternal diet, and peanut-specific IgE was not detectable in the cord blood. Peanut allergy was independently associated with intake of soy milk or soy formula (odds ratio, 2.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.2), rash over joints and skin creases (odds ratio, 2.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.0), and oozing, crusted rash (odds ratio, 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 10.2). Analysis of interview data showed a significant independent relation of peanut allergy with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil (odds ratio, 6.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 32.9). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization to peanut protein may occur in children through the application of peanut oil to inflamed skin. The association with soy protein could arise from cross-sensitization through common epitopes. Confirmation of these risk factors in future studies could lead to new strategies to prevent sensitization in infants who are at risk for subsequent peanut allergy.",0
1642,1530827,Predominant TH2-like bronchoalveolar T-lymphocyte population in atopic asthma,"BACKGROUND: In atopic asthma, activated T helper lymphocytes are present in bronchial-biopsy specimens and bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid, and their production of cytokines may be important in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Different patterns of cytokine release are characteristic of certain subgroups of T helper cells, termed TH1 and TH2, the former mediating delayed-type hypersensitivity and the latter mediating IgE synthesis and eosinophilia. The pattern of cytokine production in atopic asthma is unknown. METHODS: We assessed cells obtained by BAL in subjects with mild atopic asthma and in normal control subjects for the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for interleukin-2, 3, 4, and 5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon gamma by in situ hybridization with 32P-labeled complementary RNA. Localization of mRNA to BAL T cells was assessed by simultaneous in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence and by in situ hybridization after immunomagnetic enrichment or depletion of T cells. RESULTS: As compared with the control subjects, the subjects with asthma had more BAL cells per 1000 cell that were positive for mRNA for interleukin-2 (P less than 0.05), 3 (P less than 0.01), 4 (P less than 0.001), and 5 (P less than 0.001) and GM-CSF (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of cells expressing mRNA for interferon gamma. In the subjects with asthma, mRNA for interleukin-4 and 5 was expressed predominantly by T lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Atopic asthma is associated with activation in the bronchi of the interleukin-3, 4, and 5 and GM-CSF gene cluster, a pattern compatible with predominant activation of the TH2-like T-cell population.",0
1643,28927227,Enteric microbiome profiles during a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of surotomycin versus vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection,"The effects of surotomycin (CB-183,315, MK-4261), a bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide, and vancomycin, the current standard-of-care for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), on intestinal pathogens and microbiota were evaluated parallel to a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The single-centre cohort included 26 patients receiving surotomycin [125 or 250 mg twice daily (n = 9 each)] or oral vancomycin [125 mg four times daily (n = 8)] for 10 days. Faecal samples were collected at days 0-42 to quantify both C. difficile by conventional culture and the major components of the microbiome by quantitative PCR. Surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily reduced faecal C. difficile counts from ∼105-107 log10 cfu/g at baseline to ≤ 102 cfu/g by days 4-10 of treatment. Day 10 counts of C. difficile in 3/9 patients receiving surotomycin 125 mg twice daily remained detectable, including one patient who failed to achieve clinical cure. Bacteroidetes and Prevotella mean counts increased 0.7 log10 or remained unchanged with surotomycin 125 and 250 mg twice daily, respectively, whereas vancomycin reduced counts by 2.5-3.2 log10 (P < 0.02). Vancomycin reduced Firmicutes counts by 2.5-2.8 log10; surotomycin moderately suppressed these microbes in a dose-dependent manner. In this Phase 2 trial substudy, compared with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily, surotomycin 250 mg twice daily is as active in vivo against C. difficile, but was more sparing of microbiota. Surotomycin is no longer in development due to failed Phase 3 efficacy results. ",0

In the present investigation, we evaluated brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed Ab-drug conjugate, in 25 HL patients (median age, 32 years; range, 20-56) with recurrent disease after alloSCT (11 unrelated donors). Patients were > 100 days after alloSCT, had no active GVHD, and received a median of 9 (range, 5-19) prior regimens. Nineteen (76%) had refractory disease immediately before enrollment. Patients received 1.2 or 1.8 mg/kg of brentuximab vedotin IV every 3 weeks (median, 8 cycles; range, 1-16). Overall and complete response rates were 50% and 38%, respectively, among 24 evaluable patients. Median time to response was 8.1 weeks, median progression-free survival was 7.8 months, and the median overall survival was not reached. Cough, fatigue, and pyrexia (52% each), nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy (48% each), and dyspnea (40%) were the most frequent adverse events. The most common adverse events ? grade 3 were neutropenia (24%), anemia (20%), thrombocytopenia (16%), and hyperglycemia (12%).

1645,24442505,Nitrite reductase genes as functional markers to investigate diversity of denitrifying bacteria during agricultural waste composting,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity of denitrifier community during agricultural waste composting. The diversity and dynamics of the denitrifying genes (nirK and nirS) were determined using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Relationships between physico-chemical parameters and denitrifying genes structures were simultaneously evaluated by redundancy analysis (RDA). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that nirK clones grouped into six clusters and nirS clones into two major clusters, respectively. The results showed a very high diversity of nir gene sequences within composting samples. RDA showed that the nirK and nirS gene structures were significantly related to pH and pile temperature (P < 0.05). Significant amounts of the variation (49.2 and 38.3 % for nirK and nirS genes, respectively) were explained by pH and pile temperature, suggesting that those two parameters were the most likely ones to influence, or be influenced by the denitrifiers harboring nirK and nirS genes.

1647,30759616,Assessing the role of CAP for more sustainable and healthier food systems in Europe: A literature review,"Today, the European food system is characterized by unhealthy dietary trends, environmentally unsustainable production, and a dependency on an ageing farming population. The ongoing reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) represents an opportunity to redress these issues. This literature review highlights trends in how academic and grey literature have received CAP attempts in addressing the (i) environmental issues, (ii) nutritional outcomes, and (iii) rural livelihoods. Additionally, future policy and research directions relating to the CAP have been identified from the selected literature. The reviewed literature varies in approach and perspective. In particular, since the environment and rural development are already part of the CAP, the reviewed studies analyze and propose improvements to existing mechanisms. While for nutrition, the reviewed studies assessed possible policy strategies for integrating this sphere within the CAP, highlighting both the complexity of this task as well as its potential benefits. Despite these differences, a clear commonality emerged from the policy recommendations: the CAP should promote the European Union (EU) policy integration and multi-disciplinary and participatory research as key strategies to meet food system sustainability targets.

There are 50 million patients in the world suffering from this disease and 2 million new cases per year are observed. The necessary treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increases the risk of adverse reactions. In case of 15% of people receiving AEDs, cutaneous reactions, like maculopapular or erythematous pruritic rash, may appear within four weeks of initiating therapy with AEDs. METHODS: This study involved 300 epileptic patients in the period between September 1989 and September 2009. A cutaneous adverse reaction was defined as a diffuse rash, which had no other obvious reason than a drug effect, and resulted in contacting a physician. RESULTS: Among 300 epileptic patients of Neurological Practice in Kielce (132 males and 168 females), a skin reaction to at least one AED was found in 30 patients. As much as 95% of the reactions occurred during therapies with carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine or oxcarbazepine. One of the patients developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome. CONCLUSION: Some hypersensitivity problems of epileptic patients were obviously related to antiepileptic treatment. Among AEDs, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, vigabatrin, and phenobarbital were not associated with skin lesions, although the number of patients in the case of the latter was small.",1

1654,20814896,"A phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial of deferasirox for the treatment of iron overload in HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis","""Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption that may result in iron overload. Although phlebotomy is widely practiced, it is poorly tolerated or contraindicated in patients with anemias, severe heart disease, or poor venous access, and compliance can vary. The once-daily, oral iron chelator, deferasirox (Exjade) may provide an alternative treatment option. Patients with HH carrying the HFE gene who were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, serum ferritin levels of 300-2000 ng/mL, transferrin saturation ? 45%, and no known history of cirrhosis were enrolled in this dose-escalation study to characterize the safety and efficacy of deferasirox, comprising a core and an extension phase (each 24 weeks). Forty-nine patients were enrolled and received starting deferasirox doses of 5 (n = 11), 10 (n = 15), or 15 (n = 23) mg/kg/day. Adverse events were generally dose-dependent, the most common being diarrhea, headache, and nausea (n = 18, n = 10, and n = 8 in the core and n = 1, n = 1, and n = 0 in the extension, respectively). More patients in the 15 mg/kg/day than in the 5 or 10 mg/kg/day cohorts experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase and serum creatinine levels during the 48-week treatment period; six patients had alanine aminotransferase > 3 ? baseline and greater than the upper limit of normal range, and eight patients had serum creatinine > 33% above baseline and greater than upper limit of normal on two consecutive occasions. After receiving deferasirox for 48 weeks, median serum ferritin levels decreased by 63.5%, 74.8%, and 74.1% in the 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. In all cohorts, median serum ferritin decreased to < 250 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Deferasirox doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day can reduce iron burden in patients with HH. Based on the safety and efficacy results, starting deferasirox at 10 mg/kg/day appears to be most appropriate for further study in this patient population.""",1
1655,23433739,"Bendamustine plus rituximab versus CHOP plus rituximab as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas: an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 non-inferiority trial","""BACKGROUND: Rituximab plus chemotherapy, most often CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), is the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced indolent lymphoma, and for elderly patients with mantle-cell lymphoma. Bendamustine plus rituximab is effective for relapsed or refractory disease. We compared bendamustine plus rituximab with CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial at 81 centres in Germany between Sept 1, 2003, and Aug 31, 2008. Patients aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 2 or less were eligible if they had newly diagnosed stage III or IV indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients were stratified by histological lymphoma subtype, then randomly assigned according to a prespecified randomisation list to receive either intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle) or CHOP (cycles every 3 weeks of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg/day for 5 days) for a maximum of six cycles. Patients in both groups received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00991211, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices of Germany, BfArM 4021335. FINDINGS: 274 patients were assigned to bendamustine plus rituximab (261 assessed) and 275 to R-CHOP (253 assessed). At median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 25-57), median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in the R-CHOP group (69.5 months [26.1 to not yet reached] vs 31.2 months [15.2-65.7]; hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.74; p<0.0001). Bendamustine plus rituximab was better tolerated than R-CHOP, with lower rates of alopecia (0 patients vs 245 (100%) of 245 patients who recieved ?3 cycles; p<0.0001), haematological toxicity (77 [30%] vs 173 [68%]; p<0.0001), infections (96 [37%] vs 127 [50%]); p=0.0025), peripheral neuropathy (18 [7%] vs 73 [29%]; p<0.0001), and stomatitis (16 [6%] vs 47 [19%]; p<0.0001). Erythematous skin reactions were more common in patients in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in those in the R-CHOP group (42 [16%] vs 23 [9%]; p=0.024). INTERPRETATION: In patients with previously untreated indolent lymphoma, bendamustine plus rituximab can be considered as a preferred first-line treatment approach to R-CHOP because of increased progression-free survival and fewer toxic effects.

1656,15071114,Cognitive correlates of white matter growth and stress hormones in female squirrel monkey adults,"Neurobiological studies of stress and cognitive aging seldom consider white matter despite indications that complex brain processes depend on networks and white matter interconnections. Frontal and temporal lobe white matter volumes increase throughout midlife adulthood in humans, and this aspect of aging is thought to enhance distributed brain functions. Here, we examine spatial learning and memory, neuroendocrine responses to psychological stress, and regional volumes of gray and white matter determined by magnetic resonance imaging in 31 female squirrel monkeys between the ages of 5 and 17 years. This period of lifespan development corresponds to the years 18-60 in humans. Older adults responded to stress with greater increases in plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and modest reductions in glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity relative to young adults. Learning and memory did not differ with age during the initial cognitive test sessions, but older adults more often failed to inhibit the initial learned response after subsequent spatial reversals. Impaired cognitive response inhibition correlated with the expansion of white matter volume statistically controlling for age, stress hormones, gray matter, and CSF volumes. These results indicate that instead of enhancing cognitive control during midlife adulthood, white matter volume expansion contributes to aspects of cognitive decline. Cellular and molecular research combined with brain imaging is needed to determine the basis of white matter growth in adults, elucidate its functions during lifespan development, and provide potential new targets for therapies aimed at maintaining in humans cognitive vitality with aging.

Previous studies and recent findings from our laboratory have demonstrated the involvement of the ubiquitin proteasome system and the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in CS induced skeletal muscle catabolism. The essential amino acid leucine is a known anticatabolic agent that improves skeletal muscle metabolism in various atrophic conditions. To examine the protective effect of leucine and proteasome inhibition in CS induced muscle catabolism, C2 myotubes, from an in vitro skeletal muscle cell line, were exposed to CS in the presence or absence of leucine and a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Diameter of myotubes, levels of the main contractile proteins - myosin heavy chain and actin, expression of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 were studied by microscopy, Western blotting, and qPCR. Leucine pretreatment prevented the CS-induced reduction in diameter of myotubes and degradation of myosin heavy chain by suppressing the upregulation of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. MG132 also attenuated the CS-induced decrease in diameter of myotubes and degradation of myosin heavy chain. Our findings demonstrate that supplementation with the essential amino acid leucine and inhibition of the proteasome may protect skeletal muscle from CS induced catabolism.  ",0
1659,23650023,The impact of positive circumferential margin on survival following oesophagectomy using the new 7th TNM classification,"Previous studies looking at the influence of positive circumferential margin (CRM) on survival after oesophagectomy are conflicting. This may be due to the fact that older versions of the TNM classification were used, which do not predict survival as accurately as the new 7th edition. We examine whether CRM involvement has an impact on survival when the 7th TNM classification is used. Over a 10-year period, 199 patients who had undergone potentially curative resection for oesophageal cancer with postoperative histopathological T3 were identified. A total of 151 (75.9%) were found to have CRM involvement (<1 mm), and these were compared with patients in whom the CRM was free of tumour. Cancers were staged according to the International Union against Cancer TNM 7th edition. First, univariate and then multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the factors influencing survival. Potentially significant predictors (P < 0.1) from the univariate analysis were inserted in the forward-stepwise Cox regression model and was allowed to remain in the final model if a P-value of <0.05 was achieved. A sub-group analysis was also performed for different N-stages (N0-N3). After all analyses were performed, CRM involvement was found to have no effect on survival following oesophagectomy [hazard ratio 1.28 (95% CI: 0.82-2.01) (P = 0.28)]. This was seen for all N-stages. Stage of disease, age at operation, % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and shortness of breath [(according to New York Heart Association classification)] were all significant predictors of survival. With this study, it became clear that CRM involvement does not affect long-term survival of patients after oesophagectomy. Patients with CRM involvement should not necessarily be considered to have had an incomplete resection. ",0

1661,11391538,Inhibition of hepatitis B virus DNA replication by imino sugars without the inhibition of the DNA polymerase: therapeutic implications,"Previously we have shown that the imino sugar inhibitor of N-linked glycan processing, N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (N-nonyl-DNJ), had antiviral activity in the woodchuck model of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In studying the mechanism of action of this compound, it was discovered that imino sugars could inhibit HBV secretion without inhibiting N-linked glycoprocessing. Although N-nonyl-DNJ is an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glucosidase, here it is shown that N-nonyl-DNJ retained antiviral activity at concentrations that had no significant impact on ER glucosidase function. Taken together, these results suggested that N-nonyl-DNJ possessed an antiviral activity attributable to a function other than an impact on glycoprocessing. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments showing that N-nonyl-deoxygalactojirimycin (N-nonyl-DGJ), an alkyl derivative of galactose with no impact on glycoprocessing, retains anti-HBV activity. The data suggest that N-nonyl-DGJ exerts its antiviral action at a point before viral envelopment and may prevent the proper encapsidation of the HBV pregenomic RNA.",0
1662,7664847,Hypoxia potentiates nitric oxide synthesis and transiently increases cytosolic calcium levels in pulmonary artery endothelial cells,"There is indirect, contradictory evidence both for increased and reduced synthesis of the endothelium-derived vasodilator, nitric oxide, in the pulmonary circulation during acute hypoxia. Therefore, we decided to directly measure the effect of acute hypoxia on nitric oxide production by cultured pulmonary endothelium. Because increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration are known to initiate nitric oxide synthesis, we also studied cytosolic calcium levels. We measured the accumulation of the stable nitric oxide metabolite, nitrite, in the fluid used to superfuse the cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells at an oxygen tension (PO2) of either 20.3 (normoxia) or 4.9 kPa (hypoxia) (152 or 37 mmHg). Intracellular calcium levels were measured with dual-excitation microfluorimetry after loading the cells with the fluorescent calcium indicator, fura 2. Basal NO synthesis, measured as nitrite accumulation over 10 min, was significantly higher under hypoxic than normoxic conditions (8.3 +/- 2.2 versus 4.6 +/- 0.8 nM). Hypoxia transiently increased cytosolic calcium concentration (from 113 +/- 10 to 231 +/- 45 nM). Ryanodine and thapsigargin (which deplete intracellular calcium stores), but not the removal of extracellular calcium, inhibited the hypoxic increase in cytosolic calcium, indicating that it resulted primarily from release of intracellular calcium. Bradykinin-elicited NO synthesis was potentiated by hypoxia. Bradykinin-induced increase in cytosolic calcium was not inhibited by hypoxia. We conclude that hypoxia acutely increases cytosolic calcium levels and basal and bradykinin-stimulated nitric oxide synthesis in pulmonary artery endothelium. ",0

In clinical trials, troglitazone 200 to 800 mg daily (alone or in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin) reduced plasma or serum glucose levels and glycosylated haemoglobin compared with both baseline and placebo in patients with NIDDM refractory to other oral antidiabetic agents (usually sulphonylureas). Troglitazone was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. In patients in the US, the incidence of adverse events in troglitazone recipients was similar to that in placebo recipients.",1
1666,28102315,Methyl-Cytosine-Driven Structural Changes Enhance Adduction Kinetics of an Exon 7 fragment of the p53 Gene,"Methylation of cytosine (C) at C-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites enhances reactivity of DNA towards electrophiles. Mutations at CpG sites on the p53 tumor suppressor gene that can result from these adductions are in turn correlated with specific cancers. Here we describe the first restriction-enzyme-assisted LC-MS/MS sequencing study of the influence of methyl cytosines (MeC) on kinetics of p53 gene adduction by model metabolite benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), using methodology applicable to correlate gene damage sites for drug and pollutant metabolites with mutation sites. This method allows direct kinetic measurements by LC-MS/MS sequencing for oligonucleotides longer than 20 base pairs (bp). We used MeC and non-MeC (C) versions of a 32 bp exon 7 fragment of the p53 gene. Methylation of 19 cytosines increased the rate constant 3-fold for adduction on G at the major reactive CpG in codon 248 vs. the non-MeC fragment. Rate constants for non-CpG codons 244 and 243 were not influenced significantly by MeC. Conformational and hydrophobicity changes in the MeC-p53 exon 7 fragment revealed by CD spectra and molecular modeling increase the BPDE binding constant to G in codon 248 consistent with a pathway in which preceding reactant binding greatly facilitates the rate of covalent S ",0

Five cases of eosinophilic folliculitis occurring in HIV-negative patients treated for haematological malignancy are reported. In four cases this self-limiting, pruritic eruption, affecting the head and upper trunk, occurred 3 months after bone marrow transplantation, and the fifth case was a patient undergoing chemotherapy for Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia. This suggests that eosinophilic folliculitis is a consequence of disturbances of immune function, and is not specific for HIV infection. ",0

In vitro studies of calcium-ceftriaxone binding and solubility,"""Ceftriaxone, a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin, has recently been associated with biliary sludge formation. Analysis of the biliary concretions induced by this agent shows a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The present in vitro studies were undertaken to provide insight into the pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge formation by evaluating possible interactions that may exist between calcium, bile salts, and ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone possessed high calcium-binding affinity. The formation constant for the calcium ceftriaxone salt at 37 degrees C was about 157.3 L/mol; stoichiometry of the salt was 1:1, i.e., calcium ceftriaxone. The calcium-binding property of ceftriaxone was observed to be additive to that of taurocholate in mixed taurocholate-ceftriaxone solutions. Although the solubility product constant for calcium ceftriaxone was only 1.62 x 10(-6) mol/L2, marked metastability was observed; neither visible nor microscopic precipitates developed until the [Ca2+] x [ceftriaxone] ion product exceeded the solubility product constant by a factor of 10.4. Metastability of the calcium ceftriaxone salt was also observed in human gallbladder bile in vitro. Estimates of human biliary calcium ceftriaxone solubility in vivo were than calculated from previously-reported values for biliary [Ca2+], [ceftriaxone], and from the solubility product constant as defined in this study. Calculated saturation indices for calcium-ceftriaxone in human bile generally increased (corresponding to a decrease in solubility) with increasing ceftriaxone dose. At doses less than or equal to 1 g, saturation index was well within the metastable range of this calcium-salt. However, at doses greater than or equal to 2 g, the saturation index surpassed the metastable limit. Under these conditions, precipitation of ceftriaxone could occur. It was concluded that the development of ceftriaxone-induced biliary sludge is a solubility problem that occurs in patients receiving high-dose treatment (greater than or equal to 2 g). This study proposes that the risk of developing ceftriaxone-associated biliary """"pseudolithiasis"""" increases with increasing ceftriaxone dose and in patients with impaired gallbladder emptying.""",1
1669,7820043,The Scripps Clinic experience with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia,"Follow-up data is now available on 144 patients with hairy cell leukemia treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) at the Scripps Clinic. Of 144 patients followed for a median of 14.2 months, 123 (85%) obtained complete responses, 17 (12%) partial responses, 3 (2%) did not respond and 1 patients was unevaluable. So far, only 4 patients have relapsed at a median of 36 months. Fever was the major toxicity occurring in 43% of patients. Five patients resistant (3 patients) or intolerant (2 patients) to 2'-deoxycoformycin were also treated. Of these 5 patients, 4 obtained complete responses, including 2 patients resistant to 2'-deoxycoformycin, and 1 patient a partial response, suggesting a possible lack of cross-resistance between 2'-deoxycoformycin and 2-CdA in hairy-cell leukemia. More than 200 patients have been treated with 2-CdA worldwide with 82% obtaining complete remission and 12% partial remissions. Serial peripheral blood immunophenotypic analyses have documented the absence of circulating hairy cells. When bone marrow biopsies were examined using sensitive immunohistochemical staining techniques, residual hairy cells were detected in 25-50% of morphologic complete responders. Patients will need to be observed longitudinally to determine if this staining is predictive of relapse. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pentoxifylline, a modulator of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and other cytokines, was performed in 2-CdA-treated hairy cell leukemia patients to determine whether the incidence of neutropenic fever would be reduced. Although pentoxifylline resulted in less febrile, hospital and antibiotic therapy days than placebo, only the number of days in the hospitalized patients achieved statistical significance. 2-CdA is emerging as the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia given the high percentage of long-lasting, complete responses that follow a single course of therapy.",1
1670,1629186,Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase substituted with manganese protoporphyrin IX. Formation of a higher oxidation state and its relation to cyclooxygenase reaction,"The heme in prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGH synthase) was substituted with Mn(III)-protoporphyrin IX. The resulting enzyme, Mn-PGH synthase, showed full cyclooxygenase activity but only 0.9% of the peroxidase activity of the native iron enzyme. During the reaction with exogenous or endogenously produced hydroperoxides, a spectral intermediate of Mn-PGH synthase was observed. The electronic absorption bands of the resting enzyme at 376, 472, and 561 nm decreased, and the intermediate's bands at 417, around 513, and 625 nm appeared. The rate constant of the formation of the intermediate was about 10(4) M-1.s-1 at 22 degrees C, three orders of magnitude lower than with the iron enzyme. Spectral properties, conditions of formation, and the suppressed formation in the presence of electron donors provide evidence for a higher oxidation state of Mn-PGH synthase, tentatively a Mn(IV) species. This species was assigned to an intermediate in the peroxidase reaction of Mn-PGH synthase, the low activity of which was explained by the rate-limiting slow reaction of Mn-PGH synthase with hydroperoxides. The findings and interpretation are consistent with the published properties of other manganese-substituted peroxidases. Although the cyclooxygenase activity was similar to that of Fe-PGH synthase, the cyclooxygenase reaction of Mn-PGH synthase showed distinct differences in comparison with Fe-PGH synthase. A longer activation phase was observed which resembled the time course of the formation of the higher oxidation state. Glutathione peroxidase with glutathione, a hydroperoxide-scavenging system, inhibited the cyclooxygenase of Mn-PGH synthase at concentrations where the activity of Fe-PGH synthase was not affected. It is demonstrated that Mn-PGH synthase requires higher concentrations of hydroperoxides for the activation of the cyclooxygenase. These findings suggest that the substitution of iron with manganese in PGH synthase does not change the mechanism of the enzyme. The main difference is the much lower rate of the reaction with hydroperoxides which affects both the peroxidase activity and the hydroperoxide-dependent activation of the cyclooxygenase. A reaction scheme for Mn-PGH synthase is proposed analogous to that suggested for Fe-PGH synthase (Karthein, R., Dietz, R., Nastainczyk, W., and Ruf, H. H. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 313-320). ",0
1671,10743694,Treatment of tacrolimus-related adverse effects by conversion to cyclosporine in liver transplant recipients,"""When tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction, conversion to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (CyA) is necessary. We characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%). Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), IDDM (12), nephrotoxicity (3), GI toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (PTLD) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1). All early-conversion patients showed improvement/resolution of symptoms. Among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted. The overall rejection rate was 30%. Sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion. When tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.""",1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trabectedin was administered as a 24-h intravenous infusion every 21 days. Two dose levels were evaluated (1.3 and 1.5mg/m(2)) for safety; efficacy was then evaluated using a traditional 2-stage design (10+10) at the 1.5mg/m(2) dose level. Pharmacokinetics (day 1 and steady state) were performed during cycle 1. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, eight patients at 1.3mg/m(2) and 42 at 1.5mg/m(2). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose finding component included fatigue and reversible GGT elevation in 1/6 evaluable patients at 1.3mg/m(2) and 0/5 at 1.5mg/m(2). Efficacy was evaluated in 42 patients enrolled at the 1.5mg/m(2) dose of whom 22% experienced reversible grade 3 or 4 toxicities that included AST, ALT, or GGT elevations, myelosuppression and deep venous thrombosis. One patient with rhabdomyosarcoma had a partial response and one patient each with rhabdomyosarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma had stable disease for 2, 3 and 15 cycles, respectively. CONCLUSION: Trabectedin is safe when administered over 24h at 1.5mg/m(2). Trabectedin did not demonstrate sufficient activity as a single agent for children with relapsed paediatric sarcomas.""",1

Anakinra provided satisfactory disease control for 1 year, after which escape phenomenon occurred. After four tocilizumab injections, cutaneous melanoma developed. The persistent systemic manifestations prompted treatment with two canakinumab injections. Ten days later, she had a spiking fever, dyspnea, low back pain, abdominal pain, odynophagia, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed liver cytolysis (180 IU/L; N: 10-35), acute renal failure (creatinine, 407 mumol/L; N:50-100), thrombocytopenia (60 G/L; N: 150-400), leukocytosis (12,200/mm(3); N: 4000-10,000), hypertriglyceridemia (5070 mmol/L; N: 0.4-1.6), lactate dehydrogenase elevation (4824 IU/L; N: 135-250), and hyperferritinemia (97 761 mug/L; N:15-150).

The fine, radiating, fibrous septa developing in this setting have a distribution that is reminiscent of the location of the canals of Hering (coH). To assess the possibility of fibrous obliteration of the coH in patients receiving methotrexate, we developed a staining technique by combining an immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 7 with a modified Masson trichrome. Sixteen biopsy specimens from 7 patients were evaluated. The biopsies had a variety of histologic changes, including steatosis, anisonucleosis, multinucleation, chronic inflammation, bile duct damage, and ductular reaction. Fibrosis was present in 13 biopsy specimens (81%) and was mild in 7, moderate in 3, and severe in 3 specimens. Compared with normal (control) liver specimens, biopsy specimensfrom patients receiving methotrexate had decreased numbers of coH (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs 5.2 +/- 1.7; P < .025). In specimens with moderate or severe fibrosis, fibrous septa sometimes extended along the coH. These findings suggest that scarring of the coH might be a consequence of the toxic effects of methotrexate.""",1
1676,11832530,Expression of p53 and prognosis in children with malignant gliomas,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of children with high-grade gliomas is uncertain, even when clinical and histologic findings are considered. We investigated whether mutations in the TP53 gene or the degree of expression of p53 protein in high-grade gliomas is associated with progression-free survival in children with these tumors. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded specimens of malignant gliomas from children treated in the Children's Cancer Group study CCG-945 were assessed by mutational analysis of TP53 (121 specimens) and immunohistochemical analysis of p53 (115 specimens). For mutational studies, areas of tissue that contained malignant glioma were isolated by microdissection, and the DNA was subjected to polymerase-chain-reaction-based amplification and sequencing of TP53 exons 5, 6, 7, and 8. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with the use of a microwave-enhanced antigen retrieval and an antibody that bound both wild-type and mutant p53. RESULTS: We found a significant association between overexpression of p53 and outcome; this association was independent of histologic features, age, sex, the extent of resection, and tumor location. The rate ( +/- SE) of progression-free survival at five years was 44 +/- 6 percent in the group of 74 patients whose tumors had low levels of expression of p53 and 17 +/- 6 percent in the group of 41 patients whose tumors had overexpression of p53 (P<0.001). A nonsignificant association was observed between mutations in TP53 and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of p53 in malignant gliomas during childhood is strongly associated with an adverse outcome, independently of clinical prognostic factors and histologic findings.",0

1679,10793165,Thymic function after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency,"BACKGROUND: Immune function can be restored in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency by transplantation of unfractionated bone marrow from HLA-identical donors or T-cell-depleted marrow stem cells from haploidentical donors, with whom there is a single haplotype mismatch, without the need for chemotherapy before transplantation or prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. The role of the thymus in this process is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed the phenotypes of circulating T cells and the proliferative responses of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to phytohemagglutinin in 83 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency who received allogeneic marrow transplants without T-cell ablation from related donors over an 18-year period. We also tested for the presence of episomes of T-cell antigen receptors (extrachromosomal DNA circles formed during intrathymic T-cell development) to assess thymus-dependent T-cell reconstitution. RESULTS: Before and early after transplantation, the numbers of circulating T cells were low, with a predominance of mature CD45RO+ T cells (primarily resulting from the transplacental transfer of maternal cells); T-cell antigen-receptor episomes were undetectable in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. In 73 of the infants, thymus-derived T cells expressing CD45RA and T-cell antigen-receptor episomes were detected within three to six weeks after transplantation. The mean (+/-SD) value for thymus-dependent T-cell antigen-receptor episomes peaked (at 7311+/-8652 per microgram of peripheral-blood mononuclear-cell DNA) 1 to 2 years after transplantation and declined to low levels (less than 100 episomes per microgram of DNA) within 14 years, as compared with a gradual decline from birth to the age of about 80 years in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The vestigial thymus in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency is functional and can produce enough T cells after bone marrow transplantation to provide normal immune function.",0

This article focuses on primary biliary parasites: Ascaris lumbricoides, Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, Opisthorchis felineus, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Fasciola hepatica, and Fasciola gigantica. Tropical and subtropical countries have the highest incidence and prevalence of these infections. Diagnosis is made primarily through direct microscopic examination of eggs in the stool, duodenal, or bile contents. Radiologic imaging may show intrahepatic ductal dilatation, whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be used diagnostically and therapeutically. However, oral treatment is inexpensive and effective for most of these parasites and can prevent untoward consequences.

1682,3001579,Evidence for excitatory actions of histamine on supraoptic neurons in vitro: mediation by an H1-type receptor,"The effects of histamine on the firing of supraoptic neurosecretory neurons in the rat were examined in vitro using acutely prepared, hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants perifused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Extracellular action potentials meeting the criteria of antidromic invasion from neurohypophysial stalk stimulation were recorded from 135 neurons in the tuberal portion of the supraoptic nucleus, which lies superficially along the tuber cinereum and consists of mostly vasopressin-containing neurons. Units could be classified as slow/silent (76.3%), phasic (21.5%) or continuous (2.2%) on the basis of their spontaneous activity. Histamine applied briefly to the perifusate excited approximately one-third of the slow silent neurons and approximately two-thirds of the phasic neurons, with a wide range (10(-3)-10(-9)) in the effective concentration across neurons. The H1-receptor agonists 2-pyridylethylamine and 2-thiazolylethylamine mimicked these excitations in 10 of 12 and 3 of 6 neurons tested, respectively. The H2-receptor agonists dimaprit (4 neurons) and impromidine (5 neurons) failed to excite any of the tested neurons previously excited by histamine. The H1-receptor antagonist promethazine antagonized histamine's excitatory effect in 8 of 9 cells, while the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine had little effect on the 9 cells tested. Histamine also modified bursts of activity induced in some slow/silent neurons by antidromic stimulation without having an observable effect in the absence of an antidromic burst. In 10 of 18 neurons histamine produced an elongation of burst duration and a modest increase in intraburst firing rate when applied during an antidromically evoked burst. In an additional 5 of 17 neurons, which had neither previously responded to histamine nor shown an antidromically-evoked burst, the pairing of histamine application and antidromic shocks resulted in an antidromically evoked burst. The effects of histamine on evoked bursts also appeared to be mediated by an H1-receptor. Histamine's excitation of supraoptic neurons is thus dependent on the electrical activity expressed by the neuron at the time of testing. Conductances activated by depolarization of the neuron may be modified by histamine or this compound may alter the threshold for burst generation. Considered with data showing H1-receptor localization and histamine-immunoreactive fibers within the supraoptic nucleus, the present results, as well as those showing the potency of centrally applied histamine in releasing vasopressin, suggest histamine may act physiologically by altering the electrical activity of vasopressin-secreting neurons.

1683,2438553,Inhibition of mediator release in allergic rhinitis by pretreatment with topical glucocorticosteroids,"Patients with allergic rhinitis often have immediate symptoms after antigen challenge (the early-phase response), followed several hours later by a recurrence of symptoms (the late-phase response). Systemic glucocorticosteroids are known to inhibit the late-phase but not the early-phase response. We studied the effect of one week of pretreatment with topical (rather than systemic) glucocorticosteroids on the response to nasal challenge with antigen in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 13 allergic patients who had previously had a dual response to nasal challenge. The patients were challenged with three 10-fold increments of allergen, producing an early response, and were then followed for 11 hours, encompassing the late response, before they were rechallenged with the lowest dose of allergen. We monitored their responses by means of symptom scores and measurements of the levels of histamine, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity, and kinins in nasal lavages. Topical glucocorticosteroids significantly reduced both the symptoms and the levels of histamine, TAME-esterase activity, and kinins in the early, late, and rechallenge allergic reactions. The fact that, in contrast to treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids, prolonged pretreatment with topical glucocorticosteroids inhibited the early-phase response to antigen suggests that the route and duration of administration affect the mechanisms of action of the steroids. We conclude that inhibition of the early-phase as well as the late-phase response by topical glucocorticosteroids may provide an advantage over treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids in patients with allergic rhinitis.",0

Glucocorticoids are used for the treatment of BA. Emerging evidence has demonstrated the roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in BA. The present study investigated whether TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP were associated with the clinical stages and severity of BA and the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of BA. A total of 199 patients with BA and 174 healthy individuals were included in this study. Patients with BA underwent glucocorticoid treatment, and the TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP levels and lung functions of the subjects were measured. The correlations of the TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP levels with BA severity, clinical staging and lung functions were assessed. We investigated whether the TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP levels aided in evaluating the efficacy of using glucocorticoids for the treatment of BA. TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP exhibited high levels in patients with BA, and glucocorticoid treatment notably decreased these levels. The TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP levels were positively correlated with the clinical stages and severity of BA and negatively correlated with lung function. TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP can be used as serum markers to predict the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of BA. The key findings of this study collectively support a role for TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP in BA development, and TNF-α, IL-8 and ECP can be used as serum markers of glucocorticoid efficacy in BA. ",0

The study protocol included operative data, early postoperative complications and evaluation of left ventricular function 10(th)-14(th) day after surgery. Early complication rate had tendency to be higher in I group. Among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <20%, in I group all 6 patients died, including 5 patients who underwent aneurysmectomy combined with mitral and tricuspid anuloplasty and 2 patients who underwent both apical aneurysmectomy and posterior wall compression, in II group - 1 of 3 patients died. Early changes of left ventricular geometry in I group included decrease in left ventricular diameter, volume, mass, as well as reduction of short axis of left atrium, in II group - decrease in left ventricular diameter, mass and both axis of left atrium. Left ventricular ejection fraction had tendency to increase in both groups: in 41.9% of patients in I group and in 56.5% in II group. Following different types of left ventricular reconstruction surgery early postoperative complications rate did not differ, except higher mortality rate in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <20%, who underwent modified Dor aneurysmectomy combined with other surgical procedures.

To assess the quality of care in VHA hospitals, we compared the outcome of acute myocardial infarction among patients in VHA and non-VHA institutions while controlling for potential confounders, including coexisting conditions and severity of illness. METHODS: We studied 2486 veterans discharged from 81 VHA hospitals and 29,249 Medicare patients discharged from 1530 non-VHA hospitals, restricting our samples to men at least 65 years of age who were discharged with confirmed acute myocardial infarction. We compared coexisting conditions, severity of illness, and 30-day and 1-year mortality in the two samples. RESULTS: VHA patients were significantly more likely than Medicare patients to have a recorded history of hypertension (64.3 percent vs. 57.3 percent), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (30.9 percent vs. 23.5 percent), diabetes (34.8 percent vs. 29.0 percent), stroke (20.4 percent vs. 14.2 percent), or dementia (7.2 percent vs. 4.8 percent) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). According to both multivariate logistic regression and an analysis using 2265 matched pairs of VHA and Medicare patients, there were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year mortality. The matched-pairs analysis found that the difference in mortality at 30 days (the mortality rate among Medicare patients minus the mortality rate among VHA patients), averaged over the 5-year age groups, was -0.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -2.8 percent to 1.3 percent), and the difference in mortality at 1 year was -1.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -3.9 percent to 1.3 percent). CONCLUSIONS: VHA patients had more coexisting conditions than Medicare patients. Nevertheless, we found no significant difference in mortality between VHA and Medicare patients, a result that suggests a similar quality of care for acute myocardial infarction.",0

A reassessment of the role of these compounds in the management of alcohol dependence is clearly needed.",1
1691,14578867,Deficiency in virion secretion and decreased stability of the hepatitis B virus immune escape mutant G145R,"Hepatitis B virus with a G145R mutation in the small surface protein is considered the quintessential immune escape mutant because it frequently is found in vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections and liver transplant recipients under anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) immunoglobulin prophylaxis. Nowadays the prevalence of the variant progressively increases. However, because spread of a virus depends not only on immune pressure but also on the viral phenotype, we investigated the biologic properties of the G145R variant. The G145R mutation was introduced into wild-type (Wt) virus genome by in vitro mutagenesis. After transfection into human hepatoma cells, the DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and viral secretion ability of the mutant were studied. Furthermore, cotransfection studies were performed with the G145R variant and a Wt virus S-protein expressing construct and vice versa. Production and stability of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs), DNA, and proteins were not affected by the G145R mutation. In contrast, secretion of mutant virions was reduced significantly. Only 20% of virions were found in the medium of G145R variant-transfected cells compared with Wt virus. Furthermore, mutant virions were more sensitive to detergent treatment suggesting a diminished stability. In cotransfection studies, Wt virus S-protein rescued secretion of mutant virions, whereas mutant S-protein had a transdominant negative effect on secretion of Wt virus. Both mechanisms may support persistence of the defective mutant in a mixed population with Wt virus. In conclusion, the significant defect of the G145R mutant for secretion of infectious virions and the diminished stability of mutant virions may limit global spread of the mutant.",0
1692,471000,The use of in vitro technics to study drug-induced pancytopenia,"The confirmation of drug-induced marrow aplasia is difficult since rechallenging the patient can lead to serious morbidity. We used marrow-culture technics to challenge in vitro the bone marrow of a patient with marrow aplasia after ingestion of quinidine. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of quinidine-mediated destruction of erythrocytes, leukocytes or platelets. By contrast, use of quinidine in combination with the patient's serum substantially inhibited in vitro growth of allogeneic marrow granulocytic and erythroid series. Furthermore, use of quinidine in combination with acute-phase serum (but not acute-phase serum alone or quinidine in combination with recovery-phase serum) inhibited growth of the patient's marrow. This observation suggests that both a transient serum factor and quinidine were responsible for the marrow aplasia. These technics could be applied with minimal risk to similar patients and would permit in vitro rechallenge with the suspected drug.",0

1696,16688096,Severe liver disease associated with prolonged exposure to antiretroviral drugs,"BACKGROUND: Liver damage is frequently seen in HIV-positive subjects, often resulting from coinfection with hepatitis B and/or C viruses (HCV), alcohol abuse, etc. However, the etiology of liver disease still remains unknown for a small subset of individuals. METHODS: Cryptogenic liver disease (CLD) was defined as persistently elevated aminotransferases levels in the absence of hepatitis C and/or B viruses replication and of other common causes of liver disease (alcohol, medications, etc). We identified cases initially meeting this definition by examining all HIV-positive subjects attended during the year 2004 in 2 large HIV clinics in Spain. Their clinical charts were retrospectively reviewed, and their assessment completed when needed to rule out other less frequent causes of liver disease. The stage of liver fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy and/or elastography. To assess which factors could be associated with CLD, HIV-positive controls were chosen and matched by age, gender, and CD4 status. RESULTS: CLD was diagnosed in 17 (0.5%) out of 3200 HIV-positive patients. Their mean age was 43 years, 82.4% were male, and 76% had acquired HIV through homosexual relationships. The mean time from HIV diagnosis was >15 years, and all patients had been exposed to antiretroviral therapy. Nevirapine, stavudine, and didanosine were the drugs more frequently used by this subset of patients. None of them had liver function test abnormalities before initiating antiretroviral therapy. Advanced liver fibrosis (F3-F4 Metavir scores) was recognized in 10 (58.8%) individuals, and 9 (52.9%) had developed symptomatic liver complications, including ascites (8), portal thrombosis (6), variceal bleeding (5), and encephalopathy (2). In the case-control analysis, prolonged didanosine exposure was the only independent predictor of developing CLD in this population. CONCLUSIONS: CLD is an uncommon condition in HIV-positive individuals and might be associated with prolonged didanosine exposure. It may evolve causing severe liver complications, with variceal bleeding and portal thrombosis being particularly frequent.",1
1697,15242225,"""Listening to """"felt needs"""": investigating genital prolapse in western Nepal""","The global prevalence of genital prolapse is estimated to be 2-20% in women under age 45. In Nepal, genital prolapse appears to be widespread, but little published evidence exists to buttress this claim. This paper presents findings of two studies, one ethnographic and one clinic-based, in western Nepal. The ethnographic study involved 16 focus group discussions with 120 community members and key informants, and covered community perceptions and women's experience of prolapse and its perceived causes and consequences. The clinic-based study was conducted among 2,072 women who presented with gynaecological complaints and received a diagnosis. One in four of them had genital prolapse, of whom 95% had self-reported the prolapse. The most commonly perceived causes of prolapse were lifting heavy loads, including in the post-partum period. The adverse effects reported included difficulty urinating, abdominal pain, backache, painful intercourse, burning upon urination, white watery discharge, foul-smelling discharge, itching, and difficulty lifting, sitting, walking and standing. The results confirm prolapse as a significant public health problem in western Nepal. We strongly recommend developing systematic, rotational gynaecological clinics in rural districts, the use of a screening checklist and counselling for prevention and early management of genital prolapse by district health workers for family planning and antenatal patients.

1698,22017800,Toxicity after radiochemotherapy for glioblastoma using temozolomide--a retrospective evaluation,"PURPOSE: Retrospective evaluation of toxicity and results after radiochemotherapy for glioblastoma. METHODS: 46 patients with histopathologically proven glioblastoma received simultaneous radiochemotherapy (RCT). The mean age at the beginning of therapy was 59 years, the mean Karnofsky performance index 80%. 44 patients had been operated on before radiotherapy, two had not. A total dose of 60 Gy was applied in daily single fractions of 2.0 Gy within six weeks, 75 mg/m2/day Temozolomide were given orally during the whole radiotherapy period. RESULTS: A local progression could be diagnosed in 34/46 patients (70%). The median survival time amounted to 13.6 months resulting in one-year and two-year survival probabilities of 48% and 8%, respectively. Radiotherapy could be applied completely in 89% of the patients. Chemotherapy could be completed according to schedule only in 56.5%, the main reason being blood toxicity (50% of the interruptions). Most of those patients suffered from leucopenia and/or thrombopenia grade III and IV CTC (Common toxicity criteria). Further reasons were an unfavourable general health status or a rise of liver enzymes. The mean duration of thrombopenia and leucopenia amounted to 64 and 20 days. In two patients, blood cell counts remained abnormal until death. In two patients we noticed a rise of liver enzymes. In one of these in the healing phase of hepatitis a rise of ASAT and ALAT CTC grade IV was diagnosed. These values normalized after termination of temozolomide medication. One patient died of pneumonia during therapy. CONCLUSION: Our survival data were well within the range taken from the literature. However, we noticed a considerable frequency and intensity of side effects to bone marrow and liver. These lead to the recommendations that regular examinations of blood cell count and liver enzymes should be performed during therapy and temozolomide should not be applied or application should be terminated according to the criteria given by the manufacturer.",1

The objective of the current survey was to assess the occurrence of perceived """"fragile skin"""" across different skin types in the general adult population. Individuals aged 15-65 years from five representative geographic regions (France, Spain, Sweden, Japan, and the US) were interviewed and grouped into the following skin types: Caucasian North skin (n=1,218), Caucasian South skin (n=1,695), Asian skin (n=1,500), and Black skin (n=500). The main survey question was """"In your opinion, do you have fragile skin?"""" Concepts relating to the nature and appearance of an individual's skin were also evaluated. A total of 4,913 individuals were interviewed. Subjects in the Caucasian North, Caucasian South, Asian, and Black skin type groups responded positively to the question """"In your opinion, do you have fragile skin?"""" in the following proportions: 24.44%, 29.71%, 52.67%, and 42.20%, respectively. With the exception of individuals in the Black skin group, """"fragile skin"""" was prevalent in significantly more women than men (P<0.0001). Compared with other age categories, the prevalence of """"fragile skin"""" was significantly higher in individuals aged 15-34 years (P<0.0001), regardless of skin type. In general, individuals reporting """"fragile skin"""" were 2-3-fold more likely to respond positively to a series of questions relating to the nature and appearance of their skin. The prevalence of """"fragile skin"""" was also higher in individuals who experienced dermatosis (skin lesions of any type) in the previous 12 months. Whilst these findings need to be confirmed through objective evaluation, the current survey demonstrated that """"fragile skin"""" is perceived to occur in a substantial proportion of individuals from any given country, particularly in the age range of 15-34 years, regardless of skin type.

1703,20228403,Effect of valsartan on the incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular events,"BACKGROUND: It is not known whether drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we assigned 9306 patients with impaired glucose tolerance and established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors to receive valsartan (up to 160 mg daily) or placebo (and nateglinide or placebo) in addition to lifestyle modification. We then followed the patients for a median of 5.0 years for the development of diabetes (6.5 years for vital status). We studied the effects of valsartan on the occurrence of three coprimary outcomes: the development of diabetes; an extended composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, arterial revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina; and a core composite outcome that excluded unstable angina and revascularization. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of diabetes was 33.1% in the valsartan group, as compared with 36.8% in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the valsartan group, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.92; P<0.001). Valsartan, as compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the incidence of either the extended cardiovascular outcome (14.5% vs. 14.8%; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.07; P=0.43) or the core cardiovascular outcome (8.1% vs. 8.1%; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.14; P=0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular disease or risk factors, the use of valsartan for 5 years, along with lifestyle modification, led to a relative reduction of 14% in the incidence of diabetes but did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events.

1704,8028618,Management of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae,"The increasing resistance of S. pneumoniae to antimicrobial agents is a cause for concern. Although a number of therapeutic strategies are possible, local patterns of resistance must be considered. It is essential to determine the susceptibility of individual strains to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents that could be used for therapy. Communication between the clinician and the laboratory is vital to determine the best therapeutic options. The recent recognition of cephalosporin-resistant strains emphasizes the need to determine susceptibility to cephalosporins. Clinical laboratories should be aware of the recently proposed changes in the definition of cephalosporin resistance, and clinicians need to be aware of how these changes affect the choice of antibiotic therapy. Until pneumococcal disease can be effectively prevented, we can expect resistant pneumococcal infections to continue to pose therapeutic difficulties.",0

1706,2052060,Factor XI deficiency in Ashkenazi Jews in Israel,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Severe factor XI deficiency, which is relatively common among Ashkenazi Jews, is associated with injury-related bleeding of considerable severity. Three point mutations--a splice-junction abnormality (Type I), Glu117----Stop (Type II), and Phe283----Leu (Type III)--have been described in six patients with factor XI deficiency. Clinical correlations with these mutations have not been carried out. We determined the relative frequency of the mutations and their association with plasma levels of factor XI clotting activity and bleeding, analyzing the mutations with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction-enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The Type II and Type III mutations had similar frequencies among 43 Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe factor XI deficiency; these two mutations accounted for 49 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of a total of 86 analyzed alleles. Among 40 of the probands and 12 of their relatives with severe factor XI deficiency, patients homozygous for Type III mutation had a significantly higher level of factor XI clotting activity (mean [+/- SD] percentage of normal values, 9.7 +/- 3.8 percent; n = 13) than those homozygous for Type II mutation (1.2 +/- 0.5 percent, n = 16) or compound heterozygotes with Type II/III mutation (3.3 +/- 1.6 percent, n = 23), as well as significantly fewer episodes of injury-related bleeding. Each of these three groups had a similarly increased proportion of episodes of bleeding complications after surgery at sites with enhanced local fibrinolysis, such as the urinary tract, or during tooth extraction. CONCLUSIONS: Type II and Type III mutations are the predominant causes of factor XI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews. Genotypic analysis, assay for factor XI, and consideration of the type and location of surgery can be helpful in planning operations in patients with this disorder.",0
1707,24985696,Training maternal and child health epidemiologists: leaders for the twenty first century,"This paper reports on the structure, implementation and outcomes of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Epidemiology (MCHEPI) program at the University of Illinois School of Public Health (UIC-SPH) and discusses the successes and challenges in developing MCH Epidemiology leaders for the local, state, and national public health workforce. The MCHEPI program at UIC-SPH offers both the MPH and PhD degree and is based on six key components: integration across school divisions, competency-based training, tailored curricula, practica/dissertations with public health agencies, personal leadership training and development, and socialization. Based on data from the 1998-2012 cohorts, all former and current MCHEPI MPH students (n = 28) have participated in practica with local or state public health agencies and former and current MCHEPI doctoral students at the dissertation stage (12 out of 15) have partnered with local, state or national public health agencies in conducting their dissertations. The alumni of the MCHEPI MPH program (n = 25) appear to serve in higher level positions in their second compared to their first placements post-graduation. All MCHEPI doctoral alumni (n = 8) serve at the emerging senior level or senior scientist level upon graduation, in local, state and federal agencies, or in academe. Explicit linkage of MCHEPI students to practice through tailored curricula, practica, and dissertations with public health agencies, and the development of an identity as a member of the MCHEPI field appear to be important to the generation of epidemiology leaders for the MCH workforce. Leadership development is a lifelong process and as such, snapshots of current students and alumni at any one point in time do not provide the entire picture of the impact of MCH epidemiology training programs. Examining the trajectories of emerging leaders over time is essential for evaluating the true success of Maternal and Child Health Bureau workforce and training investments. ",0
1708,25005732,An unexpected finding: younger fathers have a higher risk for offspring with chromosomal aneuploidies,"The past decades have seen a remarkable shift in the demographics of childbearing in Western countries. The risk for offspring with chromosomal aneuploidies with advancing maternal age is well known, but most studies failed to demonstrate a paternal age effect. Retrospectively, we analyzed two case data sets containing parental ages from pre- and postnatal cases with trisomies 21, 13 and 18. The reference data set contains the parental ages of the general Swiss population. We dichotomized all couples into two distinct groups. In the first group, the mothers' integral age was as least as the father's age or older. We compared the frequency of cases in nine 5-year intervals of maternal age. In addition, we computed logistic regression models for the binary endpoint aneuploidy yes/no where paternal ages were incorporated as linear or quadratic, as well as smooth functions within a generalized additive model framework. We demonstrated that the proportion of younger fathers is uniformly different between cases and controls of live-born trisomy 21 as well, although not reaching significance, for fetuses over all mother's ages. Logistic regression models with different strategies to incorporate paternal ages confirmed our findings. The negative paternal age effect was also found in pre- and postnatal cases taken together with trisomies 13 and 18. The couples with younger fathers face almost twofold odds for a child with Down syndrome (DS). We estimated odds curves for parental ages. If confirmation of these findings can be achieved, the management of couples at risk needs a major correction of the risk stratification.  ",0

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of lorcaserin for weight reduction in obese patients during a 12-week period. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study enrolled 469 men and women between ages 18 and 65 and with BMI 30-45 kg/m(2). Patients received placebo, lorcaserin 10 mg q.d., lorcaserin 15 mg q.d., or lorcaserin 10 mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks, and were counseled to maintain their usual diet and activity. The primary end point was change in weight from baseline to day 85 by completer analysis. Safety analyses included echocardiograms at Screening and day 85/study exit. Lorcaserin was associated with progressive weight loss of 1.8 kg, 2.6 kg, and 3.6 kg at 10 mg q.d., 15 mg q.d., and 10 mg b.i.d., respectively, compared to placebo weight loss of 0.3 kg (P < 0.001 for each group). Similar results were seen by intent-to-treat last observation-carried forward (ITT-LOCF) analysis. The proportions of completers achieving > or =5% of initial body weight were 12.8, 19.5, 31.2, and 2.3% in the 10 mg q.d., 15 mg q.d., 10 mg b.i.d., and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were transient headache, nausea, and dizziness. Echocardiograms showed no apparent drug-related effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Lorcaserin was well tolerated and efficacious for weight reduction in this 12-week study. Longer-term trials employing behavior modification will be needed to more fully assess its safety and efficacy.",1

In India, about 64% of leprosy prevalence and 78% of new case detection of the worlds estimated 719,330 cases occur. Convincing results have been reported from studies on HLA class II association in leprosy. However data on HLA class I association are limited and inconsistent. The HLA A, B and C allele distribution in 103 leprosy patients and 101 normal healthy control individuals were studied by microlymphocytotoxicity assay. Further 32 multibacillary leprosy patients along with the 67 controls were studied by molecular high-resolution PCR-SSOP technique. The significant results from the present study were: 1) serologically, a significant increase in HLA A2, A11, B40 and Cw7, while a decrease of A28, B12, B15 and Cw3 were observed among the leprosy patients when compared with the controls; 2) molecular subtyping in multibacillary leprosy patients revealed a significant increase in frequency of HLA A*0203, A*0206, A*1102, B*1801, B*4016, B*5110, Cw*0407 and Cw*0703 while a decrease in the frequency of HLA A*0101, A*0211, B*4006, Cw*03031, Cw*04011 and Cw*0602 leprosy patients was observed when compared with the controls; 3) further haplotypes A*1102-B*4006-Cw*1502; A*0203-B*4016-Cw*0703; A*11-B*40 was significantly increased among the multibacillary leprosy patients when compared with the controls.

1712,21395650,Determinants of mercaptopurine toxicity in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy,"AIMS: 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on 6-MP metabolism and response. METHODS: Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common TPMT polymorphisms, nine for ITPA 94 C > A and 17 for ITPA IVS2+21 A > C. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis. RESULTS: During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with TPMT variant/wild-type ITPA (1862 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC) in patients wild-type TPMT/variant ITPA. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: In this study, age and both TPMT and ITPA genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children.",1
1713,9654706,[Diclofenac-associated acute cholestatis hepatitis],"Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory analgesic which is widely used in the therapy of inflammatory joint pain.

We report the case of a 64-year-old patient who was admitted to the hospital with an icteric hepatitis of sudden onset. The only drug that was taken before admission was diclofenac in a daily dose of 150-200 mg because of a spondylodiscitis. Work-up of the patient included ERCP, laparoscopy and liver biopsy and excluded other reasons of a cholestatic hepatitis. Discontinuation of diclofenac resulted in normalization of transaminase activity and bilirubin concentration within four months. The frequent use of diclofenac and the possibility of fatal liver damage highlights the need that diclofenac-toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute cholestatic hepatitis.",1
1714,10613730,Heterogeneity of growth potential of adult rat hepatocytes in vitro,"Nearly pure populations of small hepatocytes (SHs), parenchymal hepatocytes (PHs), and nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) were prepared from the adult rat, and cocultures of hepatocytes and NPCs were reconstituted from them first to obtain the direct evidence that NPCs promote the growth of hepatocytes and second to compare the growth potential between SHs and PHs. SHs and PHs underwent multiple divisions when cocultured with NPCs, whereas neither SHs nor PHs formed colonies at 10 days when cultured alone. Stellate cells in the NPCs were shown to be responsible for this growth promotion. SHs showed a higher growth capacity than PHs. To clearly show the relationship between the growth potential and the size of hepatocytes, SHs and PHs were further fractionated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, because the size distribution of SHs and PHs was half overlapped. SHs produced 2 cell populations, SH-R2 and SH-R3. The former showed a greater extent of granularity and autofluorescence than the latter. In contrast, PHs produced only 1 population (PH-R2), which corresponded to the SH-R2. The size of hepatocytes of SH-R3 was smaller (17.1 +/- 0.2 microm) than those of SH-R2 (22.6 +/- 0.5 microm) and PH-R2 (24.1 +/- 0.1 microm) and there was not a significant overlap in the size distribution between the 2 groups. The hepatocytes of SH-R3 were highly replicative and 4 or 5 times higher in their growth potential than those of SH-R2 and PH-R2. We concluded that the growth potential of hepatocytes is heterogeneous and is correlated with their size and the extent of their granularity and autofluorescence.",0
1715,16183445,The use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke,"We sought to determine the frequency of use of intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in patients presenting to our institution with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This observational study involved keeping a log of all patients presenting to our institution with symptoms consistent with AIS who were potential candidates for emergency thrombolysis over a 3-year period. The log included brain computed tomography (CT) scan results, whether or not rt-PA was administered, and contraindications to thrombolysis. It also included each patient's time flow through the system, from symptom onset to decision time regarding (and administration of) thrombolytics. Over the 36-month period of the study, there were 142 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) who initially were thought to be potential candidates for thrombolysis for AIS. Ninety-five (68.5%) of these 142 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of AIS. On further clarification of symptom onset, 77 (81%) of these 95 patients with AIS actually presented within 3 h, and 17 (22%) of these 77 patients met criteria for thrombolysis and had no contraindications. All 17 (100%) patients with AIS presenting within 3 h of onset and without contraindications received i.v. rt-PA in the ED. In conclusion, i.v. rt-PA can be administered for AIS within the 3-h window if a hospital is committed to providing this treatment. Thrombolysis remains a treatment for a minority of AIS patients.

1716,23639073,Differential expression of interferon-γ and chemokine genes distinguishes Rasmussen encephalitis from cortical dysplasia and provides evidence for an early Th1 immune response,"Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare complex inflammatory disease, primarily seen in young children, that is characterized by severe partial seizures and brain atrophy. Surgery is currently the only effective treatment option. To identify genes specifically associated with the immunopathology in RE, RNA transcripts of genes involved in inflammation and autoimmunity were measured in brain tissue from RE surgeries and compared with those in surgical specimens of cortical dysplasia (CD), a major cause of intractable pediatric epilepsy. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions measured the relative expression of 84 genes related to inflammation and autoimmunity in 12 RE specimens and in the reference group of 12 CD surgical specimens. Data were analyzed by consensus clustering using the entire dataset, and by pairwise comparison of gene expression levels between the RE and CD cohorts using the Harrell-Davis distribution-free quantile estimator method. Consensus clustering identified six RE cases that were clearly distinguished from the CD cases and from other RE cases. Pairwise comparison showed that seven mRNAs encoding interferon-γ, CCL5, CCL22, CCL23, CXCL9, CXCL10, and Fas ligand were higher in the RE specimens compared with the CD specimens, whereas the mRNA encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was reduced. Interferon-γ, CXCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA levels negatively correlated with time from seizure onset to surgery (P <0.05), whereas CCL23 and Fas ligand transcript levels positively correlated with the degree of tissue destruction and inflammation, respectively (P <0.05), as determined from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 and FLAIR images. Accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes in leptomeninges and perivascular spaces was a prominent feature in RE specimens resected within a year of seizure onset. Active disease is characterized by a Th1 immune response that appears to involve both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Our findings suggest therapeutic intervention targeting specific chemokine/chemokine receptors may be useful in early stage RE. ",0

Public health implications,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to five patients receiving care from an HIV-infected dentist in Florida has recently been reported. Current data indicate that the risk of HIV transmission from health care workers to patients is low. Despite this low risk, programs to notify patients of past exposure to an HIV-infected health care worker are being conducted with increasing frequency. METHODS: We recently conducted an investigation of all the patients cared for by an HIV-infected family physician during a period when he had severe dermatitis caused by Mycobacterium marinum on his hands and forearms. After reviewing the patients' records, we notified 336 patients who had undergone one or more procedures (digital examination of a body cavity or vaginal delivery) placing them at potentially increased risk of HIV infection. The patients were offered tests for HIV infection and counseling. RESULTS: Of the 336 patients, 325 (97 percent) had negative tests for HIV antibody, 3 (1 percent) refused testing, 1 (less than 1 percent) died of a cause unrelated to HIV infection before notification, and the HIV-antibody status of 7 (2 percent) remained unknown. The direct and indirect public health costs of this investigation were approximately $130,000. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation raise important questions about the risk of HIV transmission from health care workers to patients and the usefulness of HIV look-back programs, particularly in the light of recently published recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control. We propose that before a look-back investigation is undertaken, there should be a clearly identifiable risk of transmission of the infection, substantially higher than the risk requiring limitation of an HIV-infected health care worker's practice prospectively.",0

1721,16625578,Interventions for paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose,"BACKGROUND: Poisoning with paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a common cause of hepatotoxicity in the Western World. Inhibition of absorption, removal from the vascular system, antidotes, and liver transplantation are interventions for paracetamol poisoning. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of interventions for paracetamol overdose. SEARCH STRATEGY: We identified trials through electronic databases, manual searches of bibliographies and journals, authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies until December 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials and observational studies were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality plus liver transplantation. Secondary outcome measures were clinical symptoms, (eg, hepatic encephalopathy, fulminant hepatic failure), hepatotoxicity, adverse events, and plasma paracetamol concentration. We used Peto odds ratios and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for analysis of outcomes. Random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Ten small and low-methodological quality randomised trials, one quasi-randomised study, and 48 observational studies were identified. It was not possible to perform relevant meta-analyses of randomised trials that have addressed our outcome measures. Activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and ipecacuanha are able to reduce the absorption of paracetamol, but the clinical benefit is unclear. Of these, activated charcoal seems to have the best risk-benefit ratio. N-acetylcysteine seems preferable to placebo/supportive treatment, dimercaprol, and cysteamine, but N-acetylcysteine's superiority to methionine is unproven. It is not clear which N-acetylcysteine treatment protocol offers the best efficacy. No strong evidence supports other interventions for paracetamol overdose. N-acetylcysteine may reduce mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94, one trial). Liver transplantation has the potential to be life saving in fulminant hepatic failure, but refinement of selection criteria for transplantation and long-term outcome reporting are required. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight a paucity of randomised trials on interventions for paracetamol overdose. Activated charcoal seems the best choice to reduce absorption. N-acetylcysteine should be given to patients with overdose but the selection criteria are not clear. No N-acetylcysteine regime has been shown to be more effective than any other. It is a delicate balance when to proceed to liver transplantation, which may be life-saving for patients with poor prognosis.",1
1722,15759960,Acute liver failure due to iron overdose in an adult,"The vast majority of acute iron toxicity cases occur in children less than 5 years of age. Moreover, clinical hepatic injury is uncommon with most symptoms stemming from the intestinal tract (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Therefore, physicians, particularly those who do not routinely treat pediatric patients, are often unfamiliar with hepatotoxicity related to iron overdose. Nevertheless, hepatotoxicity caused by acute iron poisoning is associated with a high mortality rate. We report a case of severe hepatic injury in an adult who overdosed on iron tablets with suicidal intent. Tests for other hepatotoxins (eg, acetaminophen), hepatatrophic viruses, and other causes of acute liver injury were negative. Although peak serum iron level (340 microg/dL) was significantly lower than that reported to cause hepatotoxicity (>1,700 microg/dL), rapid and significant elevations in aminotransferases (>4,000 U/L), total bilirubin (5 mg/dL), and prothrombin time (50 seconds) occurred within 48 hours. Treatment with deferoxamine was prompt and followed by empiric N-acetylcysteine once liver injury was apparent. The patient was minimally symptomatic and she eventually had a full recovery.",1
1723,4058532,Effect of added dietary calcium on colonic epithelial-cell proliferation in subjects at high risk for familial colonic cancer,"We studied the frequency and distribution of proliferating epithelial cells lining colonic crypts in 10 subjects at high risk for familial colonic cancer, before and after oral supplementation of their conventional diets with 1.25 g of calcium as calcium carbonate. Patterns of cell proliferation were defined by dividing the colonic crypt into longitudinal compartments and comparing the numbers and fractions of tritiated thymidine--labeled epithelial cells in the various compartments. Before dietary supplementation with calcium, the profile of proliferating epithelial cells in the colonic crypts was comparable to that previously observed in subjects who had had familial colonic cancer. Two to three months after supplementation had been started, proliferation was significantly reduced and the profile of the colonic crypts approached that previously observed in subjects at low risk for colonic cancer. Our findings indicate that oral calcium supplementation induces a more quiescent equilibrium in epithelial-cell proliferation in the colonic mucosa of subjects at high risk of colon cancer, similar to that observed in subjects at low risk.",0
1724,26836220,National Cluster-Randomized Trial of Duty-Hour Flexibility in Surgical Training,"BACKGROUND: Concerns persist regarding the effect of current surgical resident duty-hour policies on patient outcomes, resident education, and resident well-being. METHODS: We conducted a national, cluster-randomized, pragmatic, noninferiority trial involving 117 general surgery residency programs in the United States (2014-2015 academic year). Programs were randomly assigned to current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) duty-hour policies (standard-policy group) or more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts (flexible-policy group). Outcomes included the 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications (primary outcome), other postoperative complications, and resident perceptions and satisfaction regarding their well-being, education, and patient care. RESULTS: In an analysis of data from 138,691 patients, flexible, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications (9.1% in the flexible-policy group and 9.0% in the standard-policy group, P=0.92; unadjusted odds ratio for the flexible-policy group, 0.96; 92% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.06; P=0.44; noninferiority criteria satisfied) or of any secondary postoperative outcomes studied. Among 4330 residents, those in programs assigned to flexible policies did not report significantly greater dissatisfaction with overall education quality (11.0% in the flexible-policy group and 10.7% in the standard-policy group, P=0.86) or well-being (14.9% and 12.0%, respectively; P=0.10). Residents under flexible policies were less likely than those under standard policies to perceive negative effects of duty-hour policies on multiple aspects of patient safety, continuity of care, professionalism, and resident education but were more likely to perceive negative effects on personal activities. There were no significant differences between study groups in resident-reported perception of the effect of fatigue on personal or patient safety. Residents in the flexible-policy group were less likely than those in the standard-policy group to report leaving during an operation (7.0% vs. 13.2%, P<0.001) or handing off active patient issues (32.0% vs. 46.3%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with standard duty-hour policies, flexible, less-restrictive duty-hour policies for surgical residents were associated with noninferior patient outcomes and no significant difference in residents' satisfaction with overall well-being and education quality.

1725,6578867,Veno-occlusive disease of the liver in children following chemotherapy for acute myelocytic leukemia,"""Three children developed acute veno-occlusive disease of the liver following combination chemotherapy for acute myelocytic leukemia. The clinical presentation was similar in all three, with acute onset of hepatomegaly and thrombocytopenia in the absence of significant transaminasemia or icterus. In all three patients, radionuclide imaging with technetium-99m sulfur colloid showed hepatosplenomegaly, decreased liver uptake, and increased splenic activity. The results of liver biopsy established the diagnosis, revealing marked centrilobular congestion with hemorrhage into the spaces of Disse, atrophy of central hepatic cords, and edema of the walls of the central and sublobular veins. Each patient showed marked improvement following temporary cessation of chemotherapy. The diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease is suggested by the triad of: (1) clinical signs and symptoms; (2) scintigraphic findings; and (3) temporal relationship to chemotherapy.""",1
1726,18785286,Halothane hepatitis in Iran: a review of 59 cases,"AIM: To study halothane hepatitis (HH) in Iran and its associated risk factors. METHODS: We retrospectively studied files of all cases diagnosed with HH referred to three referral hospitals and four private centers in Iran from April 1994 to September 2006. Information on age at surgery, gender, medications history, obesity, history of previous exposure, previous reaction to halothane, familial history, type of surgery, perioperative hypoxia or sepsis, morbidity and mortality were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 59 cases were identified. Forty-eight (81%) were women. The median age at the time of surgery was 44 years (range, 18 to 80 years). Sixty percent of patients were above 40-year-old. Obesity was observed in 22.2%. Previous history of exposures to halothane was noted in 61% of which 50% had history of post-exposure reaction. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cholecystectomy, and cosmetic surgeries (mainly weight reduction) were the most frequent surgeries. The mortality rate was 12.2%. In patients developing encephalopathy, it was as high as 50%. CONCLUSION: HH remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in centers still using this anesthetic. However, a large percentage of these cases could have been avoided. To lessen occurrence of further cases of HH, the authors suggest that in female patients having a history of surgery (or delivery) with general anesthesia, the use of halothane should be absolutely avoided. Utilization of proper substitutes in adults' anesthesia is advocated.",1

Effect of the hydrocarbon chain on the affinity of 4-substituted 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazines for 5-HT1A receptor site,The effect of the hydrocarbon chain of the model 4-substituted 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazines 12-31 on their affinity for 5-HT1A receptor sites was investigated. It was found that elongation of the 4-n-alkyl chain strongly increases the 5-HT1A affinity of the investigated compounds. The affinity reaches the maximum (Ki = 2.67 nM) for the n-hexyl derivative 20. It was shown that hydrophobic interactions of N-4 substituents of 1-arylpiperazines significantly contribute to their 5-HT1A affinity. The specific binding constant was defined as the receptor affinity of the protonated species of compounds under physiological conditions. The range of Ki(AH+) = 1 - 3 x 10(-11) M is a specific affinity limit of the investigated class of compounds at the 5-HT1A receptor sites. ,0
1728,17366663,Hypoxic conformance of metabolism in primary rat hepatocytes: a model of hepatic hibernation,"""Following prolonged hypoxia, mammalian cells invoke adaptive mechanisms to enhance oxygen delivery and promote energy conservation. We previously reported that hepatocytes subjected to prolonged moderate hypoxia (PO2 = 20-50 mmHg for > 3 hours) demonstrated a reversible inhibition of cellular respiration with maintenance of cell viability, associated with a decrease in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis; acute hypoxia (similar PO2 for < 30 minutes) did not induce a similar suppression of respiration and ATP synthesis. In the current study, using an in vitro model of primary rat hepatocytes, we measured the changes in metabolic demand for ATP during hypoxic conformance, and tested whether viability is maintained by preferentially suppressing nonessential processes while sustaining processes essential for maintaining cell homeostasis. In addition, the rate of recovery of oxygen consumption and ATP concentrations following reoxygenation after prolonged and acute hypoxia/anoxia was compared. Oxygen consumption and ATP concentrations decreased during prolonged hypoxia compared with acute hypoxia. However, ouabain-inhibitable respiration did not decrease during prolonged hypoxia, indicating that membrane Na+/K+ ATPase activity, an essential process for cell viability, was maintained. In contrast, ATP-dependent glucuronidation and sulfation of acetaminophen, deemed """"non-essential"""" processes, were decreased significantly compared with normoxic cells. After reoxygenation, cells exposed to prolonged moderate hypoxia demonstrated a more rapid recovery of respiration compared to acute hypoxia/anoxia. CONCLUSION: This """"hepatic hibernation"""" during prolonged moderate hypoxia may represent an anticipatory adaptation that seeks to maintain cell viability while delaying or preventing the onset of lethal hypoxia, and facilitates rapid recovery after the resumption of normoxia.""",0

1730,9657092,Development of pseudointima and stenosis after transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunts: characterization of cell phenotype and function,"The clinical utility of transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunts (TIPS) is frequently complicated by the ingrowth of tissue into the stent lumen, causing stent stenosis. These studies were undertaken to define the cellular and matrix components of the pseudointima, define the phenotype and function of the mesenchymal cells in the pseudointima and maintain them in culture, and to study the differences between stenotic and nonstenosed stents. A total of 35 stents were evaluated. TIPS pseudointima were examined histologically, by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to determine the cellular and connective tissue constituents. Mesenchymal cells were grown from tissue within the TIPS and around it, and their phenotype was studied and compared with control smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Masson's trichrome staining of histological sections demonstrated that TIPS tissue was composed of collagen and palisades of mesenchymal cells and was lined by an endothelium. Immunostaining demonstrated strong and uniform alpha-smooth muscle staining in TIPS mesenchymal cells and peri-TIPS cells. Type I procollagen mRNA expression was demonstrated in mesenchymal cells in and around the stent by in situ hybridization. TIPS mesenchymal cells secreted less radiolabeled fibronectin, and far more type III, relative to type I, collagen compared with peri-TIPS cells. TIPS cells also expressed high levels of type III procollagen mRNA compared with peri-TIPS cells. There was no difference between stenotic stents and nonstenosed stents with respect to clinical features, time from stenting, gross morphology, histology, presence of bile fistulae, and cell phenotype. However, smooth muscle cells (SMC) from stenotic stents demonstrated both greater cell proliferation and collagen I and III secretion compared with those from nonstenosed stents. These data demonstrate that TIPS stenosis results from an accumulation of collagen and proliferation of SMC within the stent lumen.",0
1731,6987518,Increased insulin receptors after exercise in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"Physical exercise is known to improve glucose tolerance and diminish insulin requirements in patients with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. To ascertain whether these effects of exercise are associated with alterations in insulin receptors, we studied [125I]insulin binding to erythrocytes and monocytes in athletically untrained young men with insulin-treated diabetes during three hours of postprandial bicycle exercise (nine patients) and two hours of exercise during fasting (eight patients). Compared with control periods, postprandial exercise, as well as exercise during fasting, significantly increased insulin binding to erythrocytes and monocytes at an insulin-tracer concentration of 34 pmol per liter. We suggest that similar changes occur in working muscle cells and contribute to the improved glucose tolerance induced by exercise.",0

AURA (NCT01802632) is a phase I/II clinical trial to determine the dose, safety, and efficacy of osimertinib. This article reports the results from the phase II extension component. Patients and Methods Patients with EGFR-TKI-pretreated EGFRm- and T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received once-daily osimertinib 80 mg. T790M status was confirmed by central testing from a tumor sample taken after the most recent disease progression. Patients with asymptomatic, stable CNS metastases that did not require corticosteroids were allowed to enroll. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by independent radiology assessment. Secondary end points were disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. Patient-reported outcomes comprised an exploratory objective. Results In total, 201 patients received treatment, with a median treatment duration of 13.2 months at the time of data cutoff (November 1, 2015). In evaluable patients (n = 198), ORR was 62% (95% CI, 54% to 68%), and the disease control rate was 90% (95% CI, 85 to 94). Median duration of response in 122 responding patients was 15.2 months (95% CI, 11.3 to not calculable). Median PFS was 12.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 13.8). The most common possibly causally related adverse events (investigator assessed) were diarrhea (43%; grade ? 3, < 1%) and rash (grouped terms; 40%; grade ? 3, < 1%). Interstitial lung disease (grouped terms) was reported in eight patients (4%; grade 1, n = 2; grade 3, n = 3; grade 5, n = 3).

1736,19812403,Accuracy of conflict-of-interest disclosures reported by physicians,"BACKGROUND: The recent public reporting of payments made to physicians by manufacturers of orthopedic devices provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy of physicians' conflict-of-interest disclosures. METHODS: We analyzed the reports of payments made to physicians by five manufacturers of total hip and knee prostheses in 2007. For each payment recipient who was an author of a presentation or served as a committee member or board member at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the disclosure statement was reviewed to determine whether the payment had been disclosed. To ascertain the reasons for nondisclosure, a survey was administered to physicians who had received payments that were not disclosed. RESULTS: The overall rate of disclosure was 71.2% (245 of 344 payments). For payments that were directly related to the topic of the presentation at the meeting, the rate was 79.3% (165 of 208); for payments that were indirectly related, the rate was 50.0% (16 of 32); and for payments that were unrelated, the rate was 49.2% (29 of 59) (P=0.008). In the multivariate analysis, payments were also more likely to have been disclosed if they exceeded $10,000 (P<0.001), were directed toward an individual physician rather than a company or organization (P=0.04), or included an in-kind component (P=0.002). Among the 36 physicians who responded to the survey regarding reasons for nondisclosure (response rate, 39.6%), the reasons most commonly given for nondisclosure were that the payment was unrelated to the topic of presentation at the annual meeting (38.9% of respondents) and that the physician had misunderstood the disclosure requirements (13.9%); 11.1% reported that the payment had been disclosed but was mistakenly omitted from the program. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of self-reported conflict-of-interest disclosure by physicians at a large annual meeting, the rate of disclosure was 79.3% for directly related payments and 50.0% for indirectly related payments.",0

1740,24425205,Ring finger protein20 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism through protein kinase A-dependent sterol regulatory element binding protein1c degradation,"Sterol regulatory element binding protein1c (SREBP1c) is a key transcription factor for de novo lipogenesis during the postprandial state. During nutritional deprivation, hepatic SREBP1c is rapidly suppressed by fasting signals to prevent lipogenic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that control SREBP1c turnover in response to fasting status are not thoroughly understood. To elucidate which factors are involved in the inactivation of SREBP1c, we attempted to identify SREBP1c-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Since we observed that ring finger protein20 (RNF20) ubiquitin ligase was identified as one of SREBP1c-interacting proteins, we hypothesized that fasting signaling would promote SREBP1c degradation in an RNF20-dependent manner. In this work, we demonstrate that RNF20 physically interacts with SREBP1c, leading to degradation of SREBP1c via ubiquitination. In accordance with these findings, RNF20 represses the transcriptional activity of SREBP1c and turns off the expression of lipogenic genes that are targets of SREBP1c. In contrast, knockdown of RNF20 stimulates the expression of SREBP1c and lipogenic genes and induces lipogenic activity in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) with glucagon or forskolin enhances the expression of RNF20 and potentiates the ubiquitination of SREBP1c via RNF20. In wild-type and db/db mice, adenoviral overexpression of RNF20 markedly suppresses FASN promoter activity and reduces the level of hepatic triglycerides, accompanied by a decrease in the hepatic lipogenic program. Here, we reveal that RNF20-induced SREBP1c ubiquitination down-regulates hepatic lipogenic activity upon PKA activation. CONCLUSION: RNF20 acts as a negative regulator of hepatic fatty acid metabolism through degradation of SREBP1c upon PKA activation. Knowledge regarding this process enhances our understanding of how SREBP1c is able to turn off hepatic lipid metabolism during nutritional deprivation.",0
1741,25409260,Genetic basis for clinical response to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective cancer treatments, but molecular determinants of clinical benefit are unknown. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Anti-CTLA-4 treatment prolongs overall survival in patients with melanoma. CTLA-4 blockade activates T cells and enables them to destroy tumor cells. METHODS: We obtained tumor tissue from patients with melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab or tremelimumab. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumors and matched blood samples. Somatic mutations and candidate neoantigens generated from these mutations were characterized. Neoantigen peptides were tested for the ability to activate lymphocytes from ipilimumab-treated patients. RESULTS: Malignant melanoma exomes from 64 patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade were characterized with the use of massively parallel sequencing. A discovery set consisted of 11 patients who derived a long-term clinical benefit and 14 patients who derived a minimal benefit or no benefit. Mutational load was associated with the degree of clinical benefit (P=0.01) but alone was not sufficient to predict benefit. Using genomewide somatic neoepitope analysis and patient-specific HLA typing, we identified candidate tumor neoantigens for each patient. We elucidated a neoantigen landscape that is specifically present in tumors with a strong response to CTLA-4 blockade. We validated this signature in a second set of 39 patients with melanoma who were treated with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Predicted neoantigens activated T cells from the patients treated with ipilimumab. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a genetic basis for benefit from CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma and provide a rationale for examining exomes of patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 agents are being considered.

1742,24434315,"T cell ageing: effects of age on development, survival & function","Age associated decline of the immune system continues to be a major health concern. All components of innate and adaptive immunity are adversely affected to lesser or greater extent by ageing resulting in an overall decline of immunocompetence. As a result in the aged population, there is increased susceptibility to infection, poor responses to vaccination, and increased incidence of autoreactivity. There is an increasing focus on the role of T cells during ageing because of their impact on the overall immune responses. A steady decline in the production of fresh naïve T cells, more restricted T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and weak activation of T cells are some of the effects of ageing. In this review we summarize our present understanding of the effects of ageing on naïve CD4 T cells and potential approaches for therapeutic interventions to restore protective immunity in the aged population.

1743,19491826,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, in the treatment of tropical enteropathy","OBJECTIVES: Tropical enteropathy is characterized by an increased urinary lactulose-to-mannitol (L:M) ratio on a site-specific sugar absorption test and is associated with increased intestinal permeability and decreased nutrient absorptive capacity. The etiology of tropical enteropathy is postulated to be intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with a nonabsorbable, broad-spectrum antibiotic, rifaximin, reduces the L:M ratio in rural Malawian children, among whom tropical enteropathy is common. METHODS: All children aged 3-5 years from one village were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with rifaximin for 7 days. The L:M ratio was measured before and after treatment, and the change in the L:M ratio was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were changes in the urinary sucrose-to-lactulose (SUC:L) and sucralose-to-lactulose (SCL:L) ratios, as well as changes in the fractions of each test sugar recovered in the urine. RESULTS: A total of 144 children participated in this study, of whom 76% had an elevated L:M ratio on enrollment (L:M > or = 0.10). Children who received rifaximin did not show an improvement in their L:M ratio compared with those who received placebo (-0.01+/-0.12 vs. 0.02+/-0.16, respectively, P=0.51, mean+/-s.d.), nor were there significant differences between the two groups in excretion of lactulose, mannitol, sucralose, or sucrose, or in the SUC:L and SCL:L ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin had no effect on the tropical enteropathy of 3-5-year-old Malawian children, suggesting that small-bowel bacterial overgrowth is not an important etiological factor in this condition.",1

METHODS: We performed an open-label trial at 32 sites in the United States and at 2 sites in New Zealand of 197 patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who were treatment-naive or were treated previously with a DAA. Between March 2, 2015, and September 1, 2015, patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg in a fixed-dose combination) plus GS-9857 (100 mg) once daily for 6-12 weeks, plus ribavirin for 1 treatment group consisting of treatment-naive patients with cirrhosis. The primary end point was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). RESULTS: Among treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis, 71% (24 of�34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 53-85) achieved SVR12�after 6 weeks of treatment and 100% (36 of 36; 95% CI, 90%-100%) achieved SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment. Among treatment-naive patients with cirrhosis, 94% (31�of 33; 95% CI, 80-99) achieved SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment and 81% (25 of 31; 95% CI, 63-93) achieved SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment with ribavirin. Among DAA-experienced patients treated for 12 weeks, 100% without cirrhosis (31 of 31; 95% CI, 89-100) and 100% with cirrhosis (32 of 32; 95% CI, 89-100) achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. One patient (<1%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 open-label trial, we found 8 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir plus GS-9857 to be safe and effective in treatment-naive patients; 12 weeks was safe and effective in patients previously treated with DAAs. The combination was safe and effective in patients with or without compensated cirrhosis. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02378935.""",1

1746,15048576,Diabetes-induced abnormalities in ER calcium mobilization in primary and secondary nociceptive neurons,"Development of diabetic sensory polyneuropathy is associated with alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis in primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. We have shown previously that in a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, the calcium signal is prolonged and calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores down-regulated in neurons of the nociceptive system. The aim of the present study was a more detailed characterization of calcium homeostasis in primary (dorsal root ganglia, DRG) and secondary (dorsal horn, DH) nociceptive neurons in STZ-induced diabetes. Fluorescence video-imaging was used to measure free cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in lumbar nociceptive neurons of control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Resting [Ca2+]i rose progressively in these neurons with the duration of diabetes and calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) decreased during diabetes. The amplitude of calcium release from both ryanodine- and IP3-sensitive calcium stores induced by caffeine, ionomycin, ATP or glutamate was significantly (P<0.01) lower in DRG and DH neurons from 6-week STZ-diabetic rats. Diabetes-induced changes in the calcium homeostasis were similar in DRG and DH neurons indicating that they might be general for many types of neurons from the central and peripheral nervous systems.

1748,15057268,A systematic approach to the assessment of known TNF-alpha polymorphisms in Graves' disease,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene on chromosome 6p21.3 have been associated with many autoimmune diseases; however, results have been conflicting and accurate allele frequencies have never been established in a UK Caucasian population. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of 22 known TNF-alpha SNPs in a UK Caucasian control population and investigate association of all polymorphisms with >5% minor allele frequency in a large case-control data set of patients with Graves' disease (GD). Eight of the 22 SNPs had minor allele frequencies >5% and were investigated further. The other 14 SNPs were present in the UK population at frequencies ranging from 0 to 4.7%. A significant increase of the A allele of the -238 SNP was seen in GD patients when compared with control subjects (9.6 vs 6.8%, respectively; P=0.003) and mirrored in the genotype distribution (P=0.009). Furthermore, association of the -238 SNP appears not to be due to linkage disequilibrium of the known HLA-DRB1(*)03 associations with GD. This study has established accurate allele frequencies of TNF-alpha SNPs in a UK population and provides preliminary evidence for association of the TNF-alpha gene with GD. ",0
1749,24311400,Hypercalcemia due to giant cell myocarditis: a case report,"Granulomatous diseases are a rare cause of hypercalcemia. The pathogenesis is presumed to be from endogenous production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by activated macrophages in granulomatous lesions, which harbor the 1α-hydroxylase enzyme. Herein the first case of hypercalcemia associated with giant cell myocarditis, an unusual type of granulomatous process, is reported. In this case, a patient with giant cell myocarditis had development of progressive heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome that required biventricular support. One year later, hypercalcemia associated with a relatively high 1,25-vitamin D level and a concomitantly suppressed parathyroid hormone level developed in the presence of stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Her other workup of hypercalcemia was unrevealing for vitamin D intoxication and multiple myeloma. Computed tomography of her chest showed no signs of hilar lymphadenopathy. Her calcium levels returned to normal with low-dose steroid therapy and have remained normal following a successful heart transplant. This case illustrates an unusual cause of hypercalcemia thought to be due to extrarenal calcitriol production associated with giant cell myocarditis.  ",0
1750,29907424,Repurposing drugs to treat l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease,"In this review, we discuss the opportunity for repurposing drugs for use in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease. LID is a particularly suitable indication for drug repurposing given its pharmacological diversity, translatability of animal-models, availability of Phase II proof-of-concept (PoC) methodologies and the indication-specific regulatory environment. A compound fit for repurposing is defined as one with appropriate human safety-data as well as animal safety, toxicology and pharmacokinetic data as found in an Investigational New Drug (IND) package for another indication. We first focus on how such repurposing candidates can be identified and then discuss development strategies that might progress such a candidate towards a Phase II clinical PoC. We discuss traditional means for identifying repurposing candidates and contrast these with newer approaches, especially focussing on the use of computational and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. We discuss strategies that can be categorised broadly as: in vivo phenotypic screening in a hypothesis-free manner; in vivo phenotypic screening based on analogy to a related disorder; hypothesis-driven evaluation of candidates in vivo and in silico screening with a hypothesis-agnostic component to the selection. To highlight the power of AI approaches, we describe a case study using IBM Watson where a training set of compounds, with demonstrated ability to reduce LID, were employed to identify novel repurposing candidates. Using the approaches discussed, many diverse candidates for repurposing in LID, originally envisaged for other indications, will be described that have already been evaluated for efficacy in non-human primate models of LID and/or clinically.

There is a need for perioperative treatment protocols aiming at improving tissue oxygenation (StO2). We hypothesised that intra-operative optimisation of StO2 improves tissue perfusion and thus reduces postoperative complications. Furthermore, we evaluated the feasibility of the optimisation algorithm used. We randomized 50 high-risk patients, all >65 years with ASA physical status III, who underwent major abdominal surgery under standardized balanced general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Throughout surgery StO2 was monitored at the thenar eminence using near-infrared spectroscopy. All patients were treated according to a standard care algorithm. In addition, patients in the intervention group were treated with dobutamine if necessary to keep or raise StO2 ≥ 80%. Data were recorded continuously and complications were recorded during hospital stay with a maximum of 28 days. The number of complications was not significantly different between groups (11 vs 20; p = 0.23). Eleven patients in the intervention group had no complication, versus 7 in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in length of stay in ICU or in hospital. Only ten patients in the intervention group received dobutamine. Administration of dobutamine resulted in a moderate 6 [-3 to 10] % increase of StO2. The overall protocol adherence was 94%. No statistically significant difference in outcome was realized through intraoperative optimization of StO2 values in this pilot study. The protocol used may be considered feasible for clinical practice. Further research is obligatory to define both the optimal StO2 threshold and intervention to treat tissue hypoperfusion.

We report an additional case of this rare disease. The patient was a 5-year-old boy who complained of left exophthalmos and double vision. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large epidural mass in the left frontal region that had invaded into the underlying anterior skull base. The tumor showed homogeneous, low density with nonhomogeneous contrast enhancement on the CT scans, and low intensity on the T1-weighted and high intensity on the T2-weighted MRI images. A whitish-pink, elastic, hard tumor was revealed in the epidural space in the left anterior cranial fossa, which was totally excised with curettage of the affected anterior skull base. The origin of the tumor was suspected to be the fibrous connective tissue of the sphenofrontal suture. The histological diagnosis was that of cranial fasciitis.

Metabolism of 14C-trans-sobrerol (I) by Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes did not result in covalent binding to proteins, lipid peroxidation or cytochrome P-450 destruction. 2. Subacute and chronic treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with (I) resulted only in an increase in liver cytosolic GSH-S-transferase. 3. Acute treatment of rats with trans-sobrerol or its metabolite, 8-hydroxycarvotanacetone (II) produced considerable GSH depletion, faster in the case of II, in both liver and lung; the original GSH levels were restored within 24 h. No significant increase in lipid peroxidation was found even when GSH was at its lowest level. 4.

1758,23825867,THE EFFECTS OF REDUCED CIGARETTE SMOKING ON DISCOUNTING FUTURE REWARDS: AN INITIAL EVALUATION,"To determine whether reduction of smoking via contingency management in dependent smokers would decrease the discounting of delayed reinforcers compared with smokers who did not reduce their smoking, moderate to heavy cigarette smokers were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a contingency management condition and a control condition. In three phases (baseline discounting determination for hypothetical money and cigarettes, implementation of a contingency management or control condition, and postintervention discounting determination), the procedure to reinforce reduction in cigarette smoking produced CO decreases in all subjects exposed to that procedure. Discounting decreased significantly for both cigarettes and money among the group for whom smoking reductions were reinforced, whereas the control group showed no significant change for either commodity. Reductions in smoking can lead to reductions in discounting, and increased discounting in current smokers may be a reversible effect of nicotine dependence. ",0
1759,12839296,Reversibility of cirrhotic regenerative liver nodules upon NTBC treatment in a child with tyrosinaemia type I,"UNLABELLED: In a male patient with hereditary tyrosinaemia type I (HTI), NTBC [2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexandion] treatment and a diet low in phenylalanine and tyrosine were started at the age of 4 wk. At the recommended average dosage (1 mg kg(-1)), liver failure improved transiently. After 4 mo of treatment, with increased body weight, the dose had decreased to 0.7 mg kg(-1), and diffuse cirrhotic changes in liver parenchyma and multiple nodules were visualized by ultrasonography. Multiple nodules in the liver parenchyma were differentiated from hepatocellular carcinoma by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using mangafodipir trisodium as a paramagnetic liver-specific contrast agent. Augmentation of NTBC dosage resulted in a decrease in serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and in significant regression of liver nodules on MRI. CONCLUSION: In HTI patients with a poor response to NTBC treatment and/or development of cirrhotic changes of liver parenchyma, augmentation of the recommended NTBC dosage may result in significant improvement of symptoms.",1
1760,26308596,Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab Monotherapy in Multiple Myeloma,"""BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma cells uniformly overexpress CD38. We studied daratumumab, a CD38-targeting, human IgG1? monoclonal antibody, in a phase 1-2 trial involving patients with relapsed myeloma or relapsed myeloma that was refractory to two or more prior lines of therapy. METHODS: In part 1, the dose-escalation phase, we administered daratumumab at doses of 0.005 to 24 mg per kilogram of body weight. In part 2, the dose-expansion phase, 30 patients received 8 mg per kilogram of daratumumab and 42 received 16 mg per kilogram, administered once weekly (8 doses), twice monthly (8 doses), and monthly for up to 24 months. End points included safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: No maximum tolerated dose was identified in part 1. In part 2, the median time since diagnosis was 5.7 years. Patients had received a median of four prior treatments; 79% of the patients had disease that was refractory to the last therapy received (64% had disease refractory to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs and 64% had disease refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide), and 76% had received autologous stem-cell transplants. Infusion-related reactions in part 2 were mild (71% of patients had an event of any grade, and 1% had an event of grade 3), with no dose-dependent adverse events. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 (in ? 5% of patients) were pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. The overall response rate was 36% in the cohort that received 16 mg per kilogram (15 patients had a partial response or better, including 2 with a complete response and 2 with a very good partial response) and 10% in the cohort that received 8 mg per kilogram (3 had a partial response). In the cohort that received 16 mg per kilogram, the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2 to 8.1), and 65% (95% CI, 28 to 86) of the patients who had a response did not have progression at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Daratumumab monotherapy had a favorable safety profile and encouraging efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated and refractory myeloma.

1761,32740969,Clinical Research in Hepatology in the COVID-19 Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Era: Challenges and the Need for Innovation,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has drastically altered all facets of clinical care and research. Clinical research in hepatology has had a rich tradition in several domains, including the discovery and therapeutic development for diseases such as hepatitis B and C, and studying the natural history of many forms of chronic liver disease. NIH, foundation and industry funding has provided important opportunities to advance the academic careers of young investigators while they strived to make contributions to the field. Instantaneously, however, all non-essential research activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical research to re-think their research strategy, including a shift to COVID-19 research while endeavoring to maintain their pre-existing agenda. Strategies to maintain the integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow up, safety assessments and continuation of investigation products, have included a shift to telemedicine, remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to study subjects. As a re-vamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of studies in the pre-determined time frame and the need to re-program career path timelines. Real world databases, biomarker and long term follow up studies, and research involving special groups (children, the homeless and other marginalized populations) are likely to face unique challenges. The implementation of telemedicine has been dramatically accelerated and will serve as a backbone for the future of clinical research. As we move forward, innovation in clinical trial design will be essential for conducting optimized clinical research.",0
1762,7655383,Use of cryopreserved bone marrow in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation,"Use of cryopreserved donor bone marrow may facilitate scheduling of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) by affording independence of a fixed time for bone marrow donation. The potential risk of damage to hematopoietic stem cells by cryopreservation resulting in delayed engraftment or graft failure has to be taken into account, however. To address these issues, the outcome of 19 matched related BMT (1992-94) performed with cryopreserved donor bone marrow was analyzed and compared with 19 related BMT (1990-93) receiving fresh donor bone marrow (control group). Time to engraftment of patients receiving cryopreserved bone marrow was not different from the control group (ANC > 0.2 x 10(9)/l 15.5 +/- 3.8 days vs 15.8 +/- 5.0 days; ANC > 0.5 x 10(9)/l 17.3 +/- 4.1 days vs 17.9 +/- 5.0 days, respectively). We did not find the previously described trend toward a lower incidence of acute GVHD in patients receiving cryopreserved bone marrow compared with patients receiving fresh bone marrow (acute GVHD > or = II 78 vs 64%). Furthermore, the two groups did not differ in the incidence of chronic GVHD (55 vs 38%) or day 100 survival (74 vs 68%). We conclude that in allogeneic BMT cryopreserved bone marrow cells can be safely used without jeopardising or prolonging time to engraftment. ",0
1763,17657819,Profibrogenic transforming growth factor-beta/activin receptor-like kinase 5 signaling via connective tissue growth factor expression in hepatocytes,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is important for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced liver fibrogenesis. Hepatic stellate cells have been recognized as its major cellular source in the liver. Here we demonstrate the induction of CTGF expression in hepatocytes of damaged livers and identify a molecular mechanism responsible for it. CTGF expression was found by immunohistochemistry in bile duct epithelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and hepatocytes in fibrotic liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Similarly, CTGF expression was induced in hepatocytes of carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. CTGF expression and secretion were detected spontaneously in a medium of hepatocytes after 3 days of culture, which was enhanced by stimulation with TGF-beta. TGF-beta-induced CTGF expression was mediated through the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad3 pathway, whereas activin receptor-like kinase 1 activation antagonized this effect. CTGF expression in the liver tissue of TGF-beta transgenic mice correlated with serum TGF-beta levels. Smad7 overexpression in cultured hepatocytes abrogated TGF-beta-dependent and intrinsic CTGF expression, indicating that TGF-beta signaling was required. In line with these data, hepatocyte-specific transgenic Smad7 reduced CTGF expression in carbon tetrachloride-treated animals, whereas in Smad7 knockout mice, it was enhanced. Furthermore, an interferon gamma treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection induced Smad7 expression in hepatocytes, leading to decreased CTGF expression and fibrogenesis. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for the profibrogenic activity of TGF-beta directed to hepatocytes and mediated via the up-regulation of CTGF. We identify ALK5-dependent Smad3 signaling as the responsible pathway inducing CTGF expression, which can be hindered by an activated activin receptor-like kinase 1 pathway and completely inhibited by TGF-beta antagonist Smad7.",0
1764,2819919,Baclofen disrupts passive avoidance retention in rats,"Baclofen (Lioresal, Ciba-Geigy) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and is used clinically to control spasticity. Recent studies have demonstrated that this compound produces a marked inhibition of synaptically evoked responses in area CA3 of the hippocampal slice, suggesting that this drug could influence behavior mediated by the limbic system. In the present study, male rats of the Fischer-344 strain were trained on a one-trial passive avoidance task and tested for retention 1 week later. After the training trial, separate groups of rats received either 5 or 10 mg/kg/4 ml IP of baclofen or the distilled H2O vehicle immediately, 10 min, or 60 min after training. One week later, the rats that received baclofen immediately after training reentered the test chamber with a significantly higher frequency than controls, although no differences in vacillatory responses were observed between groups. Similar effects were observed following posttrial administration of chlordiazepoxide. In a separate experiment rats were tested for locomotor activity after receiving the same doses of baclofen. Although baclofen decreased activity during a 30-min period after dosing, rats exposed to baclofen showed no significant change in activity relative to controls 1 week later. These data are consistent with the interpretation that baclofen may interfere with memory consolidation or retention. ",0
1765,2822506,The response of adenylate cyclase to ACTH in adipocyte membranes of lean and obese mice,"The response of adenylate cyclase to ACTH was examined in adipocyte membranes of lean (+/+) and obese (ob/ob) mice. The data show that the enzyme is more responsive to ACTH in membranes from obese than from lean mice. This is in contrast with the lower responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to catecholamines in the tissue of the obese than the lean mouse. In the obese, adrenalectomy completely abolished the response of cyclase to ACTH and in the lean, corticosterone supplementation augmented the ACTH response. These results show that glucocorticoids play an important role in the activation of adipocyte adenylate cyclase by ACTH and that the heightened response in the obese mouse adipocyte is related to hypercorticoidism. The results further establish that neither the hypercorticoidism nor the hyperinsulinism of the obese mouse is responsible for the impaired response of the adipocyte membranes to catecholamines, since adrenalectomy which corrected both hormonal excesses did not restore the adenylate cyclase response to isoproterenol.

1766,17668881,Effect of the interleukin-6 C174G gene polymorphism on treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis C in human immunodeficiency virus coinfected patients,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection poses a difficult therapeutic problem. Response to HCV-specific therapy is variable but might be influenced by host genetic factors, including polymorphisms of cytokine genes. Here, we studied whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) C174G gene polymorphism affects the response to antiviral treatment in HCV-infected HIV-positive subjects. We determined IL-6 genotypes in HIV-positive patients with acute (n = 52) and chronic (n = 60) hepatitis C treated with pegylated interferon-alpha. Two hundred ten HCV monoinfected, 197 HIV monoinfected, and 100 healthy individuals were studied as controls. Patients were classified into high and low producers according to IL-6 genotypes. Rates of sustained virological responses (SVRs) were compared between the IL-6 genotypes. Signal transducer and activator of transcription three phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot in HCV core-transfected human hepatoma cell line (HUH7) cells. Distribution of IL-6 genotypes did not differ significantly between the study groups. SVR was achieved in 63% of HIV/HCV coinfected patients. Carriers of the IL-6 high producer (HP) genotype had significantly higher SVR rates than patients with an IL-6 low producer genotype (70.1% versus 52%; P < 0.002). This effect was seen in both HIV-positive patients with acute (74% versus 33%; P < 0.05) and chronic (66% versus 33%; P < 0.05) hepatitis C. Multivariate analysis confirmed IL-6 HP carriage as an independent positive predictor for SVR (Odd's ratio 6.1; P = 0.004). This effect corresponds to the in vitro observation that in HCV core-transfected HUH7 cells, IL-6 overcomes the HCV core-mediated inhibition of STAT3 activation. CONCLUSION: Response rates to HCV-specific treatment are higher in HCV/HIV-positive patients carrying the IL-6 HP genotype, which might be because of IL-6 mediated STAT3 activation.",0
1767,28940531,Tear film evaluation and management in soft contact lens wear: a systematic approach,"The human tear film is a highly ordered structure consisting of a thin layer of lipid on the surface and a thicker aqueous-mucin phase, which increases in mucin concentration toward the corneal epithelial cell layer. The health of the tear film and ocular surface influences the likelihood of being able to achieve successful contact lens wear. Contact lens discomfort and dryness are the most frequent reasons why contact lens wearers experience reduced wearing times, which can eventually lead to contact lens discontinuation. Comprehensive clinical assessment of tear film integrity and ocular surface health is therefore essential prior to commencing contact lens wear, to enable the ocular surface environment to be optimised to support lens wear. These parameters should also be evaluated over the course of contact lens wear, in order to identify any aspects requiring clinical management and ensure maintenance of optimal lens-wearing conditions. This review summarises current knowledge relating to the effects of soft contact lens wear on the tear film and ocular surface. It also provides a systematic approach to evaluating tear film and ocular surface integrity, in order to guide the clinical management of tear film anomalies with respect to contact lens wear. ",0
1768,25687215,Combined Occurrence of Autosomal Dominant Aniridia and Autosomal Recessive Albinism in Several Members of a Family,"To characterize clinical and genetic aspects of a family with a unique combination of two hereditary blinding eye diseases. Comprehensive eye examination of proband and family members. Molecular analyses of the TYR and PAX6 genes. A young couple, both legally blind, requested genetic counselling regarding their ocular condition. The female was previously diagnosed with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1A) and her spouse was diagnosed with Peters anomaly. A comprehensive clinical examination revealed that the female had OCA1A combined with signs of another ocular disease, showing some similarity to aniridia. A complete ocular examination of her family members revealed that her brother also suffered from the same combined phenotype, her father had typical OCA1A signs, and her mother and sister had aniridia-like phenotype, without clinical diagnosis until the time of presentation. Molecular analysis identified two compound heterozygous TYR mutations known to cause OCAIA and cosegregate with oculocutaneous albinism. In addition, we identified a novel heterozygous PAX6 mutation confirming the atypical aniridia phenotype. We report here a unique and rare clinical phenotype that is explained by the segregation of two severe inherited eye diseases. The clinical and genetic analysis in this family allowed them to receive accurate genetic counseling. ",0
1769,28942960,Periostin in Skin Tissue Skin-Related Diseases,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is not only involved in the maintenance of normal physiological tissue but also in interactions with other ECM components, tissue remodeling, and modulating immune responses. The skin provides a distinctive environment characterized by rich fibroblasts producing various ECM proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and immune responses induced by external stimuli. Recently, periostin-a matricellular protein-has been highlighted for its pivotal functions in the skin. Analysis of periostin null mice has revealed that periostin contributes to collagen fibrillogenesis, collagen cross-linking, and the formation of ECM meshwork via interactions with other ECM components. Periostin expression is enhanced by mechanical stress or skin injury; this is indicative of the physiologically protective functions of periostin, which promotes wound repair by acting on keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Along with its physiological functions, periostin plays pathogenic roles in skin fibrosis and chronic allergic inflammation. In systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, periostin levels reflect the severity of skin fibrosis. Periostin null mice have shown reduced skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, indicating a key role of periostin in fibrosis. Moreover, in atopic dermatitis (AD), attenuated AD phenotype has been observed in periostin null mice in a house dust mite extract-induced AD mouse model. Th2 cytokine-induced periostin acts on keratinocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines that further enhance the Th2 response, thereby sustaining and amplifying chronic allergic inflammation. Thus, periostin is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammation-related disorders affecting the skin. Understanding the dynamic actions of periostin would be key to dissecting pathogenesis of skin-related diseases and to developing novel therapeutic strategies. ",0

Two Mentha arvensis and four M. longifolia genotypes were evaluated for resistance to Verticillium wilt in the greenhouse using V. dahliae isolates obtained from different hosts and belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups. Isolates of V. dahliae obtained from peppermint (M. × piperita) caused significantly higher disease severity, plant mortality, and yield reduction than isolates obtained from other hosts. Disease severity, plant mortality, and pathogen incidence in aboveground stems were higher and yields lower in peppermint, the susceptible standard, compared with the resistant standard, native spearmint (M. spicata). Root-dip inoculations of M. arvensis and M. longifolia with isolates of V. dahliae obtained from peppermint produced severe symptoms; however, both species displayed the ability to recover from infection and produce asymptomatic growth from rhizomes. Both M. arvensis cultivars exhibited lower mean disease severity ratings following cutback and regrowth and were not significantly different than native spearmint. The restriction of pathogen movement in aboveground tissue and ability to recover from infection may be important components of V. dahliae resistance in perennial mint cropping systems. ",0

1773,11518693,Cold preservation-warm reoxygenation increases hepatocyte steady-state Ca(2+) and response to Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist,"Although the role of Ca(2+) in liver transplantation injury has been the object of several studies, direct evidence for alterations in intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis after cold preservation-warm reoxygenation (CP/WR) has never been presented. We thus investigated the effects of CP/WR on steady-state Ca(2+) and responses to a Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist. Isolated rat hepatocytes were suspended in University of Wisconsin solution, stored at 4 degrees C for 0, 24, and 48 h, and reoxygenated at 37 degrees C for 1 h. Cytosolic Ca(2+) was measured in single cells by digitized fluorescence videomicroscopy. CP/WR caused a significant increase in steady-state cytosolic Ca(2+), which was inversely proportional to cell viability. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with an agent that protects mitochondrial function attenuated the increase in steady-state cytosolic Ca(2+) and improved hepatocyte viability. Ca(2+) responses to the purinergic agonist ATP also increased significantly as a function of cold storage time. This increase was related to an increase in the size of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) stores and subsequent capacitative Ca(2+) entry. Thus CP/WR significantly perturbs steady-state hepatocellular Ca(2+) and responses to Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, which may contribute to hepatocyte metabolic dysfunction observed after CP/WR. ",0

METHODS: The GeDDiS trial was a randomised controlled phase 3 trial done in 24 UK hospitals and one Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) hospital. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma of Trojani grade 2 or 3, disease progression before enrolment, and no previous chemotherapy for sarcoma or previous doxorubicin for any cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks, or intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 8 every 3 weeks. Treatment was assigned using a minimisation algorithm incorporating a random element. Randomisation was stratified by age (?18 years vs >18 years) and histological subtype. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks in the intention-to-treat population. Adherence to treatment and toxicity were analysed in the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one dose of their randomised treatment. The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trials (EudraCT) database (no 2009-014907-29) and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry (ISRCTN07742377), and is now closed to patient entry. FINDINGS: Between Dec 3, 2010, and Jan 20, 2014, 257 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (129 to doxorubicin and 128 to gemcitabine and docetaxel). Median follow-up was 22 months (IQR 15?7-29?3). The proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks did not differ between those who received doxorubicin versus those who received gemcitabine and docetaxel (46?3% [95% CI 37?5-54?6] vs 46?4% [37?5-54?8]); median progression-free survival (23?3 weeks [95% CI 19?6-30?4] vs 23?7 weeks [18?1-20?0]; hazard ratio [HR] for progression-free survival 1?28, 95% CI 0?99-1?65, p=0?06). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (32 [25%] of 128 patients who received doxorubicin and 25 [20%] of 126 patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel), febrile neutropenia (26 [20%] and 15 [12%]), fatigue (eight [6%] and 17 [14%]), oral mucositis (18 [14%] and two [2%]), and pain (ten [8%] and 13 [10%]). The three most common serious adverse events, representing 111 (39%) of all 285 serious adverse events recorded, were febrile neutropenia (27 [17%] of 155 serious adverse events in patients who received doxorubicin and 15 [12%] of 130 serious adverse events in patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel, fever (18 [12%] and 19 [15%]), and neutropenia (22 [14%] and ten [8%]). 154 (60%) of 257 patients died in the intention-to-treat population: 74 (57%) of 129 patients in the doxorubicin group and 80 (63%) of 128 in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group. No deaths were related to the treatment, but two deaths were due to a combination of disease progression and treatment. INTERPRETATION: Doxorubicin should remain the standard first-line treatment for most patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. These results provide evidence for clinicians to consider with their patients when selecting first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.

1775,310515,In vivo and in vitro effects of thymosin and adenosine deaminase on adenosine-deaminase-deficient lymphocytes,"""Two siblings with adenosine deaminase deficiency were studied before and during """"enzyme replacement"""" therapy (partial exchange transfusions with normal red cells containing the missing enzyme). The younger sib showed improvement of immunologic function during red-cell therapy alone, whereas in the older sib this improvement occurred only when the transfusions were supplemented by thymosin injections. Their clinical courses correlated with in vitro findings: lymphocytes from the younger sib differentiated to T-cell-rosette-forming cells upon addition of adenosine deaminase alone; lymphocytes from the older sibling required supplemental thymosin to form these cells. Thymic factors appear to influence the response to transfusion therapy in some patients deficient in adenosine deaminase, and supplementation of red-cell transfusion with thymic factors may be required.""",0
1776,2146132,An updated safety profile of etodolac in several thousand patients,"The safety of etodolac, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was reviewed by examining data from 3,302 patients enrolled in double-blind and open-label clinical trials and from 8,334 patients taking etodolac in post-marketing surveillance studies. The review determined that gastrointestinal disturbances are the most frequently reported side effects, followed by headache, dizziness, rash, and pruritus. The rate of abdominal pain and dyspepsia is similar to that observed with several other NSAIDs but is lower than that seen with aspirin. Gastrointestinal ulceration occurs in less than 0.3% of patients taking etodolac, and drug-related hepatic, renal, and hematologic dysfunctions are rare. The elderly appear to be no more at risk of experiencing adverse effects than the general population. Overall, the review confirmed the excellent safety profile of etodolac reported previously.",1
1777,29178212,Evolution of diastolic function algorithms: Implications for clinical practice,"We undertook this study of echocardiographic classification of diastolic function by three different algorithms to determine: (1) how frequently each algorithm classified patients and (2) how well the results agreed with one another. Several algorithms exist to grade diastolic function (DF), the Mayo Clinic scheme of Redfield et al (Mayo 2003) and the 2 ASE guideline documents of 2009 and 2016 (ASE 2009 and ASE 2016). A total of 200 consecutive echocardiograms were retrospectively analyzed; mean age of patients 60.3 ± 3.5 years, 45% male. Echocardiograms were performed using Intersocietal Accreditation Commission guidelines. Diastolic function was assessed by Mayo 2003 and ASE 2009 and 2016. Coexisting conditions affecting DF analysis, such as mitral annular calcification (MAC), were tabulated. Data were compared using a paired t-test. Concordance between algorithms was assessed using the Kappa statistic. A total of 117 of 200 studies (58.5%) were excluded for the presence of coexisting conditions (51.5%), poor image quality (2.5%), or incomplete data (4.5%). Thirty-three of the remaining 83 studies (40%) received the same grade of DF based on assessments made using the Mayo 2003 and ASE 2016 algorithms; the Kappa statistic was 0.20. 36 of the 83 studies (43%) received the same grade of DF based on assessments made using the ASE 2009 and ASE 2016 algorithms; the Kappa statistic was 0.25. Assessment of diastolic function via echocardiography cannot be reliably accomplished in approximately 50% of patients using current guidelines. Further, when studies are suitable for assessment, widely used guidelines yield discordant results. ",0
1778,17332278,Approval summary: sunitinib for the treatment of imatinib refractory or intolerant gastrointestinal stromal tumors and advanced renal cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE: To describe the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and approval of sunitinib malate (Sutent). Sunitinib received regular approval for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression or intolerance to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Additionally, sunitinib received accelerated approval for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: For the GIST indication, FDA reviewed data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with supportive evidence from a single-arm study. For the advanced renal cell carcinoma indication, FDA reviewed data from two single-arm studies of patients with cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma. RESULTS: In patients with imatinib refractory or intolerant GIST, time-to-tumor progression of sunitinib-treated patients was superior to that of placebo-treated patients. Median time-to-tumor progression of sunitinib-treated patients was 27.3 weeks, compared with 6.4 weeks for placebo-treated patients (P < 0.0001). Partial responses were observed in 6.8% of sunitinib-treated patients. In patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, partial responses were observed in 25.5% (95% confidence interval, 17.5, 34.9) and 36.5% (95% confidence interval, 24.7, 49.6) of patients treated with sunitinib. Median response durations were 27.1 and 54 weeks. The most common adverse events attributed to sunitinib included diarrhea, mucositis, skin abnormalities, and altered taste. Reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction and severe hypertension were also more common in sunitinib-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: On January 26, 2006, the FDA approved sunitinib for the treatment of patients with imatinib refractory or intolerant GIST. Accelerated approval was granted for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.",1
1779,8845258,Radiation-induced skin injury after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Case report,"A 58-year-old man underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties in June 1992 and May 1993. Approximately 3 weeks after the last procedure, a cutaneous lesion developed into an ulcer over the right scapular region. The ulcer failed to heal with conservative treatment; therefore, surgical excision was performed. The localization and the course of the development indicated injury caused by radiation, and this was confirmed by the histologic examination. To avoid such injury in interventional procedures with long fluoroscopic time, several precautions should be taken. These include continuous surveillance of the X-ray dosage, the use of different projections to avoid exposure to one skin area throughout the whole procedure, keeping the irradiated area as small as possible, and good planning of the procedure.

1780,21763935,"Rilpivirine versus efavirenz with two background nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in treatment-naive adults infected with HIV-1 (THRIVE): a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial","""BACKGROUND: The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), rilpivirine (TMC278; Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, County Cork, Ireland), had equivalent sustained efficacy to efavirenz in a phase 2b trial in treatment-naive patients infected with HIV-1, but fewer adverse events. We aimed to assess non-inferiority of rilpivirine to efavirenz in a phase 3 trial with common background nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). METHODS: We undertook a 96-week, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial in 98 hospitals or medical centres in 21 countries. We enrolled adults (?18 years) not previously given antiretroviral therapy and with a screening plasma viral load of 5000 copies per mL or more and viral sensitivity to background N(t)RTIs. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) using a computer-generated interactive web-response system to receive oral rilpivirine 25 mg once daily or efavirenz 600 mg once daily; all patients received an investigator-selected regimen of background N(t)RTIs (tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate plus emtricitabine, zidovudine plus lamivudine, or abacavir plus lamivudine). The primary outcome was non-inferiority (12% margin on logistic regression analysis) at 48 weeks in terms of confirmed response (viral load <50 copies per mL, defined by the intent-to-treat time to loss of virologic response [TLOVR] algorithm) in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00543725. FINDINGS: From May 22, 2008, we screened 947 patients and enrolled 340 to each group. 86% of patients (291 of 340) who received at least one dose of rilpivirine responded, compared with 82% of patients (276 of 338) who received at least one dose of efavirenz (difference 3.5% [95% CI -1.7 to 8.8]; p(non-inferiority)<0.0001). Increases in CD4 cell counts were much the same between groups. 7% of patients (24 of 340) receiving rilpivirine had a virological failure compared with 5% of patients (18 of 338) receiving efavirenz. 4% of patients (15) in the rilpivirine group and 7% (25) in the efavirenz group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Grade 2-4 treatment-related adverse events were less common with rilpivirine (16% [54 patients]) than they were with efavirenz (31% [104]; p<0.0001), as were rash and dizziness (p<0.0001 for both) and increases in lipid levels were significantly lower with rilpivirine than they were with efavirenz (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Despite a slightly increased incidence of virological failures, a favourable safety profile and non-inferior efficacy compared with efavirenz means that rilpivirine could be a new treatment option for treatment-naive patients infected with HIV-1.

METHODS: From May 2003 through December 2004, adults with a CD4 cell count < or =250 cells/microL or World Health Organization stage 3/4 HIV disease were prescribed ART. We calculated probabilities for time to toxicity and single-drug substitution as well as multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for development of toxicity. RESULTS: ART (stavudine plus lamivudine with nevirapine [96%] or efavirenz [4%]) was prescribed for 1029 adults, contributing 11,268 person-months of observation. Toxicities developed in 543 instances in 411 (40%) patients (incidence rate = 4.47/100 person-months): 36% peripheral neuropathy (9% severe); 6% rash (2% severe); 2% hypersensitivity reaction; < or =0.5% acute hepatitis, anemia, acute pancreatitis, or lactic acidosis; and 13% other. Probabilities of remaining free from any toxicity at 6, 12, and 18 months were 0.76, 0.59, and 0.47 and from any severe toxicity at 6, 12, and 18 months were 0.92, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively. For 217 patients (21%), 222 single-drug substitutions were made, mostly because of peripheral neuropathy or rash. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical toxicities were common, but no patients discontinued ART because of toxicity. The most common toxicities, peripheral neuropathy and rash, were managed with single-drug substitutions. In resource-limited settings, toxicity from ART regimens containing stavudine or nevirapine is manageable but more tolerable regimens are needed.""",1

1783,18614781,Noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation [NIPPV]) appears to be of benefit in the immediate treatment of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may reduce mortality. We conducted a study to determine whether noninvasive ventilation reduces mortality and whether there are important differences in outcome associated with the method of treatment (CPAP or NIPPV). METHODS: In a multicenter, open, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, patients were assigned to standard oxygen therapy, CPAP (5 to 15 cm of water), or NIPPV (inspiratory pressure, 8 to 20 cm of water; expiratory pressure, 4 to 10 cm of water). The primary end point for the comparison between noninvasive ventilation and standard oxygen therapy was death within 7 days after the initiation of treatment, and the primary end point for the comparison between NIPPV and CPAP was death or intubation within 7 days. RESULTS: A total of 1069 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 77.7+/-9.7 years; female sex, 56.9%) were assigned to standard oxygen therapy (367 patients), CPAP (346 patients), or NIPPV (356 patients). There was no significant difference in 7-day mortality between patients receiving standard oxygen therapy (9.8%) and those undergoing noninvasive ventilation (9.5%, P=0.87). There was no significant difference in the combined end point of death or intubation within 7 days between the two groups of patients undergoing noninvasive ventilation (11.7% for CPAP and 11.1% for NIPPV, P=0.81). As compared with standard oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation was associated with greater mean improvements at 1 hour after the beginning of treatment in patient-reported dyspnea (treatment difference, 0.7 on a visual-analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 1.3; P=0.008), heart rate (treatment difference, 4 beats per minute; 95% CI, 1 to 6; P=0.004), acidosis (treatment difference, pH 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04; P<0.001), and hypercapnia (treatment difference, 0.7 kPa [5.2 mm Hg]; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.9; P<0.001). There were no treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noninvasive ventilation induces a more rapid improvement in respiratory distress and metabolic disturbance than does standard oxygen therapy but has no effect on short-term mortality.

A total of 121 patients were enrolled and assessed for safety, and 119 were examined for clinical efficacy. The main underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (38.0%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (18.2%), and malignant lymphoma (18.2%). The median initial daily dose and duration of micafungin treatment were 150�mg/day and 13�days, respectively. The overall response rate for suspected IFIs (n?=?119), based on four composite endpoints, including baseline IFI, breakthrough IFIs (proven and probable), survival, and premature discontinuation, was 79.0%. In addition, the response rate for FN (n?=?81), based on these four endpoints as well as defervescence during neutropenia, was 39.5%. Breakthrough IFIs (proven, probable, and possible) occurred in five patients during micafungin treatment. All of these patients were positive for either BG or GM before the breakthrough IFIs. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with micafungin was 10.7% and most were mild. The majority of AEs were liver dysfunction. These results indicate the effectiveness and safety of micafungin as an empirical therapy for suspected IFIs, including FN, and the usefulness of monitoring both BG and GM to detect breakthrough IFIs.",1

The extent to which such heterogeneity can be influenced by individual driver mutations remains to be evaluated. Here, we analyzed genomic (whole-exome sequencing, targeted exome sequencing) and epigenomic data from 496 patients and used the three most recurrently mutated genes to stratify patients (IDH, KRAS, TP53, """"undetermined""""). Using this molecular dissection approach, each subgroup was determined to possess unique mutational signature preferences, comutation profiles, and enriched pathways. High-throughput drug repositioning in seven patient-matched cell lines, chosen to reflect the genetic alterations specific for each patient group, confirmed in silico predictions of subgroup-specific vulnerabilities linked to enriched pathways. Intriguingly, patients lacking all three mutations (""""undetermined"""") harbored the most extensive structural alterations, while isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant tumors displayed the most extensive DNA methylome dysregulation, consistent with previous findings. CONCLUSION: Stratification of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients based on occurrence of mutations in three classifier genes (IDH, KRAS, TP53) revealed unique oncogenic programs (mutational, structural, epimutational) that influence pharmacologic response in drug repositioning protocols; this genome dissection approach highlights the potential of individual mutations to induce extensive molecular heterogeneity and could facilitate advancement of therapeutic response in this dismal disease.

1786,14341318,SIALADENITIS AND MAJOR SALIVARY GLAND TUMORS IN CHILDREN: EXPERIENCE AT LOS ANGELES CHILDRENS HOSPITAL AND A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE,"Except for mumps, the benign lesions most frequently seen in the salivary glands of a child are parotitis, hemangioendotheliomas and mixed tumors. Carcinoma and sarcoma are uncommon. Rapid growth and pain are features of malignant change. Chronic parotitis usually subsides under conservative treatment. If operation is necessary, total parotidectomy is advisable. Scout x-ray films and sialangiographic examination are useful in differentiating an inflammatory lesion from a neoplastic growth.The treatment of choice for a non-inflammatory tumor is surgical excision, for most parotid tumors are radioresistant. Small masses should be completely excised for pathological evaluation. Since operation entails risk of damage to the seventh nerve, incisional biopsy may occasionally be indicated in the case of a large diffuse lesion for it is very likely to be benign and operation unnecessary. The risks of seventh nerve damage are magnified in a child as the anatomic structures are smaller and the nerve lies in a more superficial position. ",0

A strategic perspective from systems science,"Systems science provides organizational principles supported by biologic findings that can be applied to any organization; any incongruence indicates an incomplete or an already failing system. U.S. health care is commonly referred to as a system that consumes an ever- increasing percentage of the gross domestic product and delivers seemingly diminishing value. To perform a comparative study of U.S. health care with the principles of systems science and, if feasible, propose solutions. General systems theory provides the theoretical foundation for this observational research. A degree of compliance of U.S. health care with systems principles and its space-time functional location within the dynamic systems model. RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: U.S. health care is an incomplete system further threatened by the fact that it functions in the zone of chaos within the dynamic systems model. Complying with systems science principles and the congruence of pertinent cycles, U.S. health care would likely dramatically improve its value creation for all of society as well as its resiliency and long-term sustainability.Immediate corrective steps could be taken: Prioritize and incentivize health over care; restore fiscal soundness by combining health and life insurance for the benefit of the insured and the payer; rebalance horizontal/providers and vertical/government hierarchies.

1788,603217,Intensive physical therapy after fractures of the femoral shaft,"22 patients with fractures of the femoral shaft were divided into 2 groups. One group (12 patients) were given the standard postoperative physiotherapy and the remainder (10 patients) received intensive physiotherapy. Clinical examination of the knee joint was performed 2, 4 and 9 weeks postoperatively. The patients' mean age was 31 years; 15 of them were men. The fractures in 18 patients were treated with intramedullary nailing, 2 with a long-shanked Jewett nail and 2 with AO-nailing. Mobilisation and quadriceps atrophy of the injured limb of the patients given intensive physiotherapy appeared to improve faster than in the patients of the routine physiotherapy group. Nine weeks after  the operation the range of knee movement had normalised in the cases given intensive physiotherapy. The flexion strength of the knee in the operated limb was close to the values for the normal limb after nine weeks, but the extension strength was still 40-66% below the values for the healthy limb. The greatest increase in muscle power occurred during the first four postoperative weeks. Intensive physiotherapy seems to hasten the recovery of quadriceps strength of the patients with fractures of the femoral shaft, and to shorten the duration of sick leave of the patients operated on by closed intramedullary nailing.

METHODS: A total of 1050 black patients who had New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure with dilated ventricles were randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine or placebo in addition to standard therapy for heart failure. The primary end point was a composite score made up of weighted values for death from any cause, a first hospitalization for heart failure, and change in the quality of life. RESULTS: The study was terminated early owing to a significantly higher mortality rate in the placebo group than in the group given isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine (10.2 percent vs. 6.2 percent, P=0.02). The mean primary composite score was significantly better in the group given isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine than in the placebo group (-0.1+/-1.9 vs. -0.5+/-2.0, P=0.01; range of possible values, -6 to +2), as were its individual components (43 percent reduction in the rate of death from any cause [hazard ratio, 0.57; P=0.01] 33 percent relative reduction in the rate of first hospitalization for heart failure [16.4 percent vs. 22.4 percent, P=0.001], and an improvement in the quality of life [change in score, -5.6+/-20.6 vs. -2.7+/-21.2, with lower scores indicating better quality of life; P=0.02; range of possible values, 0 to 105]). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine to standard therapy for heart failure including neurohormonal blockers is efficacious and increases survival among black patients with advanced heart failure.",0

1794,20146261,Deletion of CD39 on natural killer cells attenuates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice,"Natural killer (NK) cells play crucial roles in innate immunity and express CD39 (Ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 [E-NTPD1]), a rate-limiting ectonucleotidase in the phosphohydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides to adenosine. We have studied the effects of CD39 gene deletion on NK cells in dictating outcomes after partial hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). We show in mice that gene deletion of CD39 is associated with marked decreases in phosphohydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate to adenosine monophosphate on NK cells, thereby modulating the type-2 purinergic (P2) receptors demonstrated on these cells. We note that CD39-null mice are protected from acute vascular injury after single-lobe warm IRI, and, relative to control wild-type mice, display significantly less elevation of aminotransferases with less pronounced histopathological changes associated with IRI. Selective adoptive transfers of immune cells into Rag2/common gamma null mice (deficient in T cells, B cells, and NK/NKT cells) suggest that it is CD39 deletion on NK cells that provides end-organ protection, which is comparable to that seen in the absence of interferon gamma. Indeed, NK effector mechanisms such as interferon gamma secretion are inhibited by P2 receptor activation in vitro. Specifically, ATPgammaS (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) inhibits secretion of interferon gamma by NK cells in response to interleukin-12 and interleukin-18, providing a mechanistic link between CD39 deletion and altered cytokine secretion. CONCLUSION: We propose that CD39 deficiency and changes in P2 receptor activation abrogate secretion of interferon gamma by NK cells in response to inflammatory mediators, thereby limiting tissue damage mediated by these innate immune cells during IRI.",0

During 13.5 years of follow-up, myocardial infarction occurred in 92 men, stroke in 37, and death from causes other than myocardial infarction or stroke in 60. The blood pressure, degree of smoking, serum cholesterol, and fibrinogen level measured at the base-line examination proved to be significant risk factors for infarction by univariate analyses during follow-up, and blood pressure and fibrinogen were risk factors for stroke. Fibrinogen and smoking were strongly related to each other. The relation between fibrinogen and infarction, and between fibrinogen and stroke, became weaker when blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and smoking habits were taken into account, but was still significant for stroke. Although causality cannot be inferred from these data, it is possible that the fibrinogen level plays an important part in the development of stroke and myocardial infarction.",0

This study was conducted to collect and analyze available prevalence data to be used for estimating the hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden of disease. In this systematic review, antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) seroprevalence data from 232 articles were pooled to estimate age-specific seroprevalence curves in 1990 and 2005, and to produce age-standardized prevalence estimates for each of 21 GBD regions using a model-based meta-analysis. This review finds that globally the prevalence and number of people with anti-HCV has increased from 2.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2.1%-2.5%) to 2.8% (95% UI: 2.6%-3.1%) and >122 million to >185 million between 1990 and 2005. Central and East Asia and North Africa/Middle East are estimated to have high prevalence (>3.5%); South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean, Central, and Southern Latin America, Caribbean, Oceania, Australasia, and Central, Eastern, and Western Europe have moderate prevalence (1.5%-3.5%); whereas Asia Pacific, Tropical Latin America, and North America have low prevalence (<1.5%). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of global HCV infection necessitates renewed efforts in primary prevention, including vaccine development, as well as new approaches to secondary and tertiary prevention to reduce the burden of chronic liver disease and to improve survival for those who already have evidence of liver disease.",0

1798,18326895,Comparison of pro B-natriuretic peptide in hypertensive patients with and without diastolic dysfunction,"to evaluate whether pro BNP can be used for detection of diastolic dysfunction. thirty nine hypertensive patients with normal systolic function, consecutively referred for echocardiography examination between October and December 2004 were recruited in the study. Diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed when echocardiographic mitral flow pattern demonstrated impaired relaxation, pseudonormalization or restrictive like patterns. NT-pro BNP levels were assessed using electro chemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) method. Unpaired t test was used to analyze the results. twelve out of thirty nine subjects had normal diastolic function. All base line characteristics, except for uric acid, were equally distributed between normal and abnormal diastolic function group. NT-pro BNP levels were nearly significantly higher in the diastolic dysfunction group (P=0.053). NT-pro BNP levels trends to be higher in hypertensive subjects with diastolic dysfunction. ",0
1799,29186678,Hyperglycemia Impairs Neutrophil Mobilization Leading to Enhanced Metastatic Seeding,"Preexisting diabetes is a risk factor for the development of multiple types of cancer. Additionally, diabetic patients face a poorer prognosis when diagnosed with cancer. To gain insight into the effects of hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, on tumor growth and metastatic progression, we combined mouse models of cancer and hyperglycemia. We show that while hyperglycemia attenuates primary tumor growth, it concomitantly increases metastatic seeding in a distant organ. We further show that the increase in metastatic seeding is due to impaired secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and impaired neutrophil mobilization. Normalizing blood glucose levels using insulin rescues neutrophil recruitment and tumor growth and concomitantly reduces metastatic seeding. These results provide links among hyperglycemia-induced changes in neutrophil mobilization, primary tumor growth, and metastatic progression. Furthermore, our observations highlight the importance of normalizing blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic cancer patients. ",0

1801,24532785,Efficacy and safety of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis: interim observational programme results,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials established the efficacy and safety of natalizumab. Data are needed over longer periods of time and in the clinical practice setting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term safety of natalizumab and its impact on annualised relapse rate and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: The Tysabri (natalizumab) Observational Program (TOP) is an open-label, multinational, 10-year prospective study in clinical practice settings. RESULTS: In this 5-year interim analysis, 4821 patients were enrolled. Follow-up for at least 4 years from natalizumab commencement in 468 patients and at least 2 years in 2496 patients revealed no new safety signals. There were 18 cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy reported, following 11-44 natalizumab infusions. Mean annualised relapse rate decreased from 1.99 in the 12 months prior to baseline to 0.31 on natalizumab therapy (p<0.0001), remaining low at 5 years. Lower annualised relapse rates were observed in patients who used natalizumab as first MS therapy, in patients with lower baseline EDSS scores, and in patients with lower prenatalizumab relapse rates. Mean EDSS scores remained unchanged up to 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Interim TOP data confirm natalizumab's overall safety profile and the low relapse rate and stabilised disability levels in natalizumab-treated patients with RRMS in clinical practice.

1802,15710213,Hepatitis C coinfection increases the risk of fulminant hepatic failure in patients with HIV in the HAART era,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is uncertain if patients coinfected with hepatitis C and HIV are more likely to suffer fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) when compared to patients with HIV-only. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using national administrative databases from the Department of Veterans Affairs in patients hospitalized for the first time with HIV and/or hepatitis C between 10/1991 and 9/2000. Fulminant hepatic failure was defined as occurring after the index hospitalization through 9/2001 in the absence of pre-existing liver disease. We calculated incidence rates, Kaplan Meier cumulative incidence curves, and Cox proportional hazards ratios while adjusting for demographics and other potential confounders. RESULTS: We identified 11,678 patients with HIV-only and 4761 patients with coinfection. There were 92 cases of fulminant hepatic failure yielding an incidence rate of 1.1/1000 person-years and 2.5/1000 person-years in the HIV-only and coinfected groups. The cumulative incidence of fulminant hepatic failure in the coinfected group was higher than in the HIV-only group (P<0.0001). The risk of fulminant hepatic failure in patients with coinfection compared to HIV-only during the HAART era was several folds higher than that during the pre-HAART era. CONCLUSIONS: HAART and hepatitis C coinfection appeared to act synergistically in HIV-infected patients to increase the risk of fulminant hepatic failure, a rare but often fatal disease.",1
1803,25006926,Papillary meningioma with vital abnormal vessels,"Papillary meningioma is an uncommon meningioma subtype of World Health Organization grade III. It could show some radiologic profiles pointing to malignant behavior, such as a cystic change, a heterogeneous enhancement, and an ill- defined border. However, to date, the radiologic profile described in this article has not been reported in previous literatures, and it is just the characteristic being considered as the major cause for patients' death. A 16-year-old adolescent boy with a 6-month history of headache was admitted to our department on June 28, 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant well-defined mass in the left temporal region, with a severe flow void on T2-weighted image and an abundant stripelike enhancement on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced scan. In view of its middle cranial fossa location (one predilection site for meningioma), meningioma was suspected preoperatively. A regular left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. Unexpectedly, extreme hemorrhage happened intraoperatively, and it was difficult to stop the bleeding. After identification of no hemorrhage in the operative cavity through intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, the operation was finished, with an overall blood loss of 15,000 mL. The patient died of brain stem dysfunction the second day after the operation.  ",0
1804,24622668,"Acarbose compared with metformin as initial therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: an open-label, non-inferiority randomised trial","BACKGROUND: Metformin is the only first-line oral hypoglycaemic drug for type 2 diabetes recommended by international guidelines with proven efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, little information exists about its use in Asian populations. We aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the ?-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, extensively adopted in China, compared with metformin as the alternative initial therapy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this 48-week, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with a mean HbA1c of 7?5%, were enrolled from 11 sites in China. After a 4-week lifestyle modification run-in, patients were assigned to 24 weeks of monotherapy with metformin or acarbose as the initial treatment, followed by a 24-week therapy phase during which add-on therapy was used if prespecified glucose targets were not achieved. Primary endpoints were to establish whether acarbose was non-inferior to metformin in HbA1c reduction at week 24 and week 48 timepoints. The non-inferiority margin was 0?3%, with an expected null difference in the change from baseline to week 48 in HbA1c. Analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR-TRC-08000231. FINDINGS: Of the 788 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups, 784 patients started the intended study drug. HbA1c reduction at week 24 was -1?17% in the acarbose group and -1?19% in the metformin group. At week 48, the HbA1c reduction was -1?11% (acarbose) and -1?12% (metformin) with difference 0?01% (95% CI -0?12 to 0?14, p=0?8999). Six (2%) patients in the acarbose group and seven (2%) patients in the metformin group had serious adverse events, and two (1%) and four (1%) had hypoglycaemic episodes. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that acarbose is similar to metformin in efficacy, and is therefore a viable choice for initial therapy in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

1805,30765335,Glucose Metabolism Is Required for Platelet Hyperactivation in a Murine Model of Type 1 Diabetes,"Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have increased thrombosis and platelet activation. The mechanisms for platelet hyperactivation in diabetes are incompletely understood. T1DM is accompanied by hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and increased inflammation in addition to an altered hormonal milieu. In vitro analysis of platelets revealed that normal glucose reduces platelet activation whereas hyperglycemic conditions increase platelet activation. We therefore hypothesized that hyperglycemia increases platelet glucose utilization, which increases platelet activation to promote thrombosis. Glucose uptake and glycolysis were increased in platelets isolated from mice given streptozotocin (STZ) to induce T1DM in concert with induction of GLUT3. Platelets from STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited increased activation after administration of protease-activated receptor 4 peptide and convulxin. In contrast, platelets isolated from GLUT1 and GLUT3 double-knockout (DKO) mice, which lack the ability to use glucose, failed to increase activation in hyperglycemic mice. Diabetic mice displayed decreased survival in a collagen/epinephrine-induced pulmonary embolism model of in vivo platelet activation relative to nondiabetic controls. Survival after pulmonary embolism was increased in diabetic DKO mice relative to nondiabetic controls. These data reveal that increased platelet glucose metabolism in vivo contributes to increased platelet activation and thrombosis in a model of T1DM. ",0

Pergolide Monotherapy Study Group","""OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pergolide monotherapy provides symptomatic relief in early PD. BACKGROUND: Early treatment with dopamine agonists may reduce the risk of motor fluctuations, which are most likely linked to levodopa therapy. Pergolide, a D1-D2 dopamine agonist, has been studied as """"add on"""" therapy in PD, but no controlled clinical trial studying the efficacy of pergolide monotherapy is available. METHODS: The efficacy and tolerability of pergolide were evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 3-month trial versus placebo. Patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD, a modified Hoehn & Yahr score of 1 to 3, and a score greater than 14 points on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III at baseline were enrolled in the study (pergolide, n = 53; placebo, n = 52). RESULTS: Patient characteristics at study entry were comparable in the two study groups. The pergolide group showed a significantly greater percent of responders (defined as a -30% decrease in UPDRS part III score at end point) compared with placebo (57% versus 17%; p < 0.001). Pergolide-treated patients experienced a significantly greater improvement than placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001) in UPDRS (overall, part II, and part III) score, Schwab & England score, and Clinical Global Impression improvement score. By the study end the mean dose of pergolide was 2.06 mg/day. Six patients in the pergolide group versus two patients in the placebo group discontinued the study because of treatment emergent side effects. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that pergolide monotherapy may be an efficacious and well-tolerated first-line treatment in patients with early-stage PD.""",1
1807,26259026,TM6SF2 rs58542926 is not associated with steatosis and fibrosis in large cohort of patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C,"We tested the putative association of the rs58542926 variant of TM6SF2, a recently described genetic determinant of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with steatosis and fibrosis in genotype 1(G1) chronic hepatitis C(CHC) patients. A total of 694 consecutively biopsied Caucasian G1 CHC patients were genotyped for TM6SF2 rs58542926, IL28B rs12979860 and PNPLA3 rs738409. Steatosis was classified as absent (<5%), mild-moderate(5-29%) and severe(≥30%), Fibrosis was considered severe if=F3-F4. Carriers of TM6SF2 rs58542926 (6.3% of patients) exhibited lower serum levels of cholesterol (P = 0.04) and triglycerides (P = 0.01), but a similar distribution of steatosis severity (P = 0.63), compared to noncarriers. Prevalence and severity of steatosis were reduced in IL28B C allele carriers (P = 0.005) and elevated in PNPLA3 G allele carriers (P < 0.001). After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index and homoeostasis model assessment score, steatosis severity was independently associated with IL28B rs12979860 (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.86, P = 0.001) and PNPLA3 rs738409 (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.46-2.83, P < 0.001), but not TM6SF2 rs58542926 (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82-2.69, P = 0.19). Variants of TM6SF2 (30.9% vs. 25%, P = 0.40), IL28B and PNPLA3 were not directly associated with fibrosis severity, although variants of IL28B and PNPLA3 promoted steatosis (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.75, P = 0.01) that in turn is associated with severe fibrosis. In G1 CHC patients, TM6SF2 rs58542926 does not affect the histological severity of liver damage. However, IL28B rs12979860 and PNPLA3 rs738409 modify steatosis. ",0
1808,9110908,Effects of cardiac sympathetic innervation on coronary blood flow,"BACKGROUND: The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in regulating coronary blood flow is controversial. We sought to determine the degree to which cardiac efferent sympathetic signals modulate coronary blood flow. The heterogeneous sympathetic reinnervation in transplanted hearts provides a model for studying the vasomotor responses to adrenergic stimulation in reinnervated and denervated coronary territories of the same heart. METHODS: We studied 14 cardiac-transplant recipients who had normal coronary arteries and no evidence of rejection and 8 normal subjects. We used positron-emission tomography with [(11)C]hydroxyephedrine, an analogue of norepinephrine, to delineate sympathetic innervation. Using [(13)N]ammonia, we measured myocardial blood flow at rest, during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and in response to sympathetic stimulation induced by cold pressor testing. RESULTS: In the transplant recipients, the uptake of [(11)C]hydroxyephedrine was greater in the territory served by the left anterior descending artery (0.15+/-0.01) than in those served by the right coronary artery (0.07+/-0.01, P<0.001) or the circumflex artery (0.09+/-0.01, P<0.001). The basal flow was similar in all three regions, as was the percent increase in flow during hyperemia. However, the increase in flow in response to cold pressor testing was higher in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (46+/-10 percent) than in those of the right coronary artery (16+/-5 percent, P=0.01) or the circumflex artery (23+/-6 percent, P=0.06), although the changes in hemodynamics and levels of circulating catecholamines were similar. No such regional differences were observed in the normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in coronary blood flow in response to sympathetic stimulation correlated with the regional norepinephrine content in the cardiac sympathetic-nerve terminals. These findings suggest that cardiac adrenergic signals play an important part in regulating myocardial blood flow.",0

However, such presumed hepatotoxicity was a minor problem in the use of cyclosporin A. The complication was less frequent than that of nephrotoxicity, was as easily manageable with reductions in the cyclosporin A dosage, and generally did not cause clinical illness. In an occasional case, late hepatotoxicity can force a therapeutic change from cyclosporin A to azathioprine, but careful consideration should be given to the dangers of subsequent rejection.",1
1810,7079928,The effect of immunosuppression on the patency and structure of canine vein allografts in the venous system,The effect of immunosuppression on allogeneic femoral vein grafts placed into the venous system of dogs was studied. Autologous vein grafts demonstrated clear patency and few histologic changes up to four weeks after operation. Allogeneic vein grafts in dogs not receiving immunosuppression showed thrombosis in all instances within less than four weeks. Standard immunosuppression therapy reduced the thrombosis rate to 25 per cent at four weeks in dogs with femoral vein allografts. Only mild histologic changes were observed in these grafts. ,0
1811,19920916,Experience with the once-yearly histrelin (GnRHa) subcutaneous implant in the treatment of central precocious puberty,"In 2007, a hydrogel histrelin implant was approved for the treatment of children with central precocious puberty (CPP). Children with CPP commonly have reduced height potential due to premature closure of the epiphyseal growth plates from exposure to sex steroids. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) treatment halts puberty and allows for improvement of adult height. A hydrogel implant delivery system utilizing the potent GnRHa, histrelin, was first developed for use in men with prostate cancer. A once yearly histrelin subcutaneous implant was subsequently developed for the treatment of children with CPP. Studies to date have demonstrated safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of this treatment option in patients treated up to 2 years. The most common adverse effects of the implant relate to implant site pain or bruising. Cost of this treatment seems comparable to somewhat higher than the commonly used GnRHa treatment option, depot leuprolide. While long term studies are needed to establish continued efficacy and safety beyond 2 years of treatment, the histrelin implant appears to be an attractive option for GnRHa treatment in patients with CPP.",1

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol are better than beta-blocker alone for prevention of ICD shocks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized controlled trial with blinded adjudication of events of 412 patients from 39 outpatient ICD clinical centers located in Canada, Germany, United States, England, Sweden, and Austria, conducted from January 13, 2001, to September 28, 2004. Patients were eligible if they had received an ICD within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to treatment for 1 year with amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta-blocker alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was ICD shock for any reason. RESULTS: Shocks occurred in 41 patients (38.5%) assigned to beta-blocker alone, 26 (24.3%) assigned to sotalol, and 12 (10.3%) assigned to amiodarone plus beta-blocker. A reduction in the risk of shock was observed with use of either amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol vs beta-blocker alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.68; P<.001). Amiodarone plus beta-blocker significantly reduced the risk of shock compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52; P<.001) and sotalol (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22-0.85; P = .02). There was a trend for sotalol to reduce shocks compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.01; P = .055). The rates of study drug discontinuation at 1 year were 18.2% for amiodarone, 23.5% for sotalol, and 5.3% for beta-blocker alone. Adverse pulmonary and thyroid events and symptomatic bradycardia were more common among patients randomized to amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite use of advanced ICD technology and treatment with a beta-blocker, shocks occur commonly in the first year after ICD implant. Amiodarone plus beta-blocker is effective for preventing these shocks and is more effective than sotalol but has an increased risk of drug-related adverse effects.Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00257959.""",1

1815,8596546,A preliminary study of growth hormone in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy is a physiologic response that allows the heart to adapt to an excess hemodynamic load. We hypothesized that inducing cardiac hypertrophy with recombinant human growth hormone might be an effective approach to the treatment of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which compensatory cardiac hypertrophy is believed to be deficient. METHODS: Seven patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and moderate-to-severe heart failure were studied at base line, after three months of therapy with human growth hormone, and three months after the discontinuation of growth hormone. Standard therapy for heart failure was continued throughout the study. Cardiac function was evaluated with Doppler echocardiography, right-heart catheterization, and exercise testing. RESULTS: When administered at a dose of 14 IU per week, growth hormone doubled the serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I. Growth hormone increased left-ventricular-wall thickness and reduced chamber size significantly. Consequently, end-systolic wall stress (a function of both wall thickness and chamber size) fell markedly (from a mean [+/-SE] of 144+/-11 to 85+/-8 dyn per square centimeter, P<0.001). Growth hormone improved cardiac output, particularly during exercise (from 7.4+/-0.7 to 9.7+/-0.9 liters per minute, P=0.003), and enhanced ventricular work, despite reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption (from 56+/-6 to 39+/-5 ml per minute, P=0.005) and energy production (from 1014+/-100 to 701+/-80 J per minute, P=0.002). Thus, ventricular mechanical efficiency rose from 9+/-2 to 21+/-5 percent (P=0.006). Growth hormone also improved clinical symptoms, exercise capacity, and the patients' quality of life. The changes in cardiac size and shape, systolic function, and exercise tolerance were partially reversed three months after growth hormone was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant human growth hormone administered for three months to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy increased myocardial mass and reduced the size of the left ventricular chamber, resulting in improvement in hemodynamics, myocardial energy metabolism, and clinical status.",0
1816,22898823,Differentiated umbilical cord matrix stem cells as a new in vitro model to study early events during hepatitis B virus infection,"The role of cell differentiation state on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication has been well demonstrated, whereas how it determines cell susceptibility to HBV entry is far less understood. We previously showed that umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSC) can be differentiated towards hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. In this study we infected undifferentiated (UD-) and differentiated (D-) UCMSCs with HBV and studied the infection kinetics, comparing them to primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). UD-UCMSCs, although permissive to viral binding, had a very limited uptake capacity, whereas D-UCMSCs showed binding and uptake capabilities similar to PHHs. Likewise, asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) was up-regulated in UCMSCs upon differentiation. In D-UCMSCs, a dose-dependent inhibition of HBV binding and uptake was observed when ASGPR was saturated with known specific ligands. Subsequent viral replication was shown in D-UCMSCs but not in UD-UCMSCs. Susceptibility of UCMSCs to viral replication correlated with the degree of differentiation. Replication efficiency was low compared to PHHs, but was confirmed by (1) a dose-dependent inhibition by specific antiviral treatment using tenofovir; (2) the increase of viral RNAs along time; (3) de novo synthesis of viral proteins; and (4) secretion of infectious viral progeny. CONCLUSION: UCMSCs become supportive of the entire HBV life cycle upon in vitro hepatic differentiation. Despite low replication efficiency, D-UCMSCs proved to be fully capable of HBV uptake. Overall, UCMSCs are a unique human, easily available, nontransformed, in vitro model of HBV infection that could prove useful to study early infection events and the role of the cell differentiation state on such events.",0

METHODS: We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%. The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health. The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content. RESULTS: At 6 months, participants assigned to each diet had lost an average of 6 kg, which represented 7% of their initial weight; they began to regain weight after 12 months. By 2 years, weight loss remained similar in those who were assigned to a diet with 15% protein and those assigned to a diet with 25% protein (3.0 and 3.6 kg, respectively); in those assigned to a diet with 20% fat and those assigned to a diet with 40% fat (3.3 kg for both groups); and in those assigned to a diet with 65% carbohydrates and those assigned to a diet with 35% carbohydrates (2.9 and 3.4 kg, respectively) (P>0.20 for all comparisons). Among the 80% of participants who completed the trial, the average weight loss was 4 kg; 14 to 15% of the participants had a reduction of at least 10% of their initial body weight. Satiety, hunger, satisfaction with the diet, and attendance at group sessions were similar for all diets; attendance was strongly associated with weight loss (0.2 kg per session attended). The diets improved lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00072995.)",0

1820,7687982,Effect of short-term ethanol treatment on voltage-dependent calcium channels in Kupffer cells,"Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, are activated by calcium, and several reports indicate that their function (e.g., phagocytosis and cytokine production) is altered by ethanol. We recently found that Kupffer cells contain L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the effect of short-term ethanol treatment on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells were isolated from rats 2 hr after intragastric administration of ethanol (5 gm/kg intragastrically). Cytosolic free calcium concentration of cultured Kupffer cells was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. In Kupffer cells isolated from control rats, partial replacement of extracellular Na+ by K+ caused an increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration in a concentration-dependent manner (half-maximal effect was observed with 81 mmol/L K+), presumably because of membrane depolarization. Acute ethanol treatment in vivo shifted the concentration-response curve for K+ to the right (half-maximal effect was observed with 94 mmol/L K+) and reduced the maximal elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration by means of K+. Significantly, the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 (1 mumol/L) shifted the concentration-response curve for K+ to the left in control and ethanol-treated groups (half-maximal effect was observed with 61 and 77 mmol/L K+, respectively). Moreover, the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (10 mumol/L) prevented the increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration in both groups. When extracellular Ca2+ was omitted from the incubation medium, the increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration due to depolarization were prevented completely. However, direct addition of ethanol to the cell cultures was without effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
1821,30855740,Patient Safety Outcomes under Flexible and Standard Resident Duty-Hour Rules,"BACKGROUND: Concern persists that extended shifts in medical residency programs may adversely affect patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized noninferiority trial in 63 internal-medicine residency programs during the 2015-2016 academic year. Programs underwent randomization to a group with standard duty hours, as adopted by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in July 2011, or to a group with more flexible duty-hour rules that did not specify limits on shift length or mandatory time off between shifts. The primary outcome for each program was the change in unadjusted 30-day mortality from the pretrial year to the trial year, as ascertained from Medicare claims. We hypothesized that the change in 30-day mortality in the flexible programs would not be worse than the change in the standard programs (difference-in-difference analysis) by more than 1 percentage point (noninferiority margin). Secondary outcomes were changes in five other patient safety measures and risk-adjusted outcomes for all measures. RESULTS: The change in 30-day mortality (primary outcome) among the patients in the flexible programs (12.5% in the trial year vs. 12.6% in the pretrial year) was noninferior to that in the standard programs (12.2% in the trial year vs. 12.7% in the pretrial year). The test for noninferiority was significant (P?=?0.03), with an estimate of the upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (0.93%) for a between-group difference in the change in mortality that was less than the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1 percentage point. Differences in changes between the flexible programs and the standard programs in the unadjusted rate of readmission at 7 days, patient safety indicators, and Medicare payments were also below 1 percentage point; the noninferiority criterion was not met for 30-day readmissions or prolonged length of hospital stay. Risk-adjusted measures generally showed similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: Allowing program directors flexibility in adjusting duty-hour schedules for trainees did not adversely affect 30-day mortality or several other measured outcomes of patient safety.

Here, we report additional outcomes for the subpopulation of patients with tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologically confirmed stage IV sq-NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to receive a maximum of six 3-week cycles of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) i.v., days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) i.v., day 1) chemotherapy with or without necitumumab (800 mg i.v., days 1 and 8). Patients in the chemotherapy plus necitumumab group with no progression continued on necitumumab alone until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. SQUIRE included mandatory tissue collection. EGFR protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a central laboratory. Exploratory analyses were pre-specified for patients with EGFR protein expressing (EGFR > 0) and non-expressing (EGFR = 0) tumors. RESULTS: A total of 982 patients [90% of intention-to-treat (ITT)] had evaluable IHC results. The large majority of these patients (95%) had tumor samples expressing EGFR protein; only 5% had tumors without detectable EGFR protein. Overall survival (OS) for EGFR > 0 patients was significantly longer in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin group than in the gemcitabine-cisplatin group {stratified hazard ratio (HR) 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69, 0.92; P = 0.002]; median 11.7 months (95% CI 10.7, 12.9) versus 10.0 months (8.9, 11.4)}. Additionally, an OS benefit was seen in all pre-specified subgroups in EGFR > 0 patients. However, OS HR for EGFR = 0 was 1.52. Adverse events of interest with the largest difference between treatment groups in EGFR > 0 patients (Grade >/=3) were hypomagnesemia (10% versus <1%) and skin rash (6% versus <1%). CONCLUSIONS: In line with SQUIRE ITT, addition of necitumumab to gemcitabine-cisplatin significantly prolonged OS and was generally well tolerated in the subpopulation of patients with EGFR-expressing advanced sq-NSCLC. The benefit from addition of necitumumab to chemotherapy was not apparent in this analysis for the small subgroup of patients with non-EGFR-expressing tumors. CLINICAL TRIAL: NCT00981058.""",1

Patients with urinary tract infections were given 150 mg/kg/day of piperacillin sodium or 200 mg/kg/day or carbenicillin sodium in divided doses every six hours intravenously. Patients with other infections were given 250 mg/kg/day of piperacillin sodium and 450 mg/kg/day of carbenicillin sodium; 53/56 (95%) patients treated with piperacillin and 45/51 (88%) patients treated with carbenicillin were cured clinically. In general, the drugs were well tolerated. There were, however, more adverse experiences in the groups taking carbenicillin. Of special interest was the finding of liver function test abnormalities in 17/78 (21%) carbenicillin recipients (evaluative and nonevaluative cases). We concluded that piperacillin was effective and safe. It has potential for use in a great variety of infections.""",1
1824,7661686,Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis and Clostridium difficile toxin positivity,"To examine a possible relationship between prophylactic antibiotic therapy (PAT) and the development of Clostridium difficile toxin (CDT) positivity. Retrospective case-control study. Tertiary care medical center in New York, NY. A total of 357 patients, admitted from November 1992 to April 1994, with positive. CDT assays. Of these, 23 patients (6%) received only PAT for elective surgical procedures. Thirty-nine patients were matched as controls for age, sex, and surgical procedure. Both CDT positivity and inappropriate use of PAT. Appropriate PAT was used in 26 (42%) of 62 patients (17% cases, 56% controls). The Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the summary odds ratio for the development of CDT positivity from inappropriate use of PAT was 5.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 23.64). Main duration between the operation and the final antibiotic dose was significantly longer in the CDT-positive group compared with the control group (3.1 vs 1.7 days, P < .05). The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the CDT-positive group compared with the control group (16.5 vs 10.2 days, P < .05). The prolonged use of PAT in elective surgical cases increases the risk of developing CDT positivity. The appropriate use of PAT could significantly reduce health costs by eliminating unnecessary doses of antibiotics, by decreasing the rate of CDT positivity, and by shortening the hospital stay. Restrictive policies may need to be implemented to prevent further antibiotic misuse. ",0

It causes annual epidemics of disease for which vaccination is the cornerstone of public health policy. The inadequacies of vaccine supply in the US during the 2004 influenza season revealed the deficiencies of current vaccine development and delivery. One outcome of this was the accelerated approval of an inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine, Fluarix. This paper reviews the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of this vaccine, and makes recommendations for the incorporation of Fluarix into the public health framework alongside other similar vaccines.

1826,28195391,RIG-I is a key antiviral interferon-stimulated gene against hepatitis E virus regardless of interferon production,"Interferons (IFNs) are broad antiviral cytokines that exert their function by inducing the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, little is known about the antiviral potential of these cellular effectors on hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, the leading cause of acute hepatitis globally. In this study, we profiled the antiviral potential of a panel of important human ISGs on HEV replication in cell culture models by overexpression of an individual ISG. The mechanism of action of the key anti-HEV ISG was further studied. We identified retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) as the key anti-HEV ISGs. We found that basal expression of RIG-I restricts HEV infection. Pharmacological activation of the RIG-I pathway by its natural ligand 5'-triphosphate RNA potently inhibits HEV replication. Overexpression of RIG-I activates the transcription of a wide range of ISGs. RIG-I also mediates but does not overlap with IFN-?-initiated ISG transcription. Although it is classically recognized that RIG-I exerts antiviral activity through the induction of IFN production by IRF3 and IRF7, we reveal an IFN-independent antiviral mechanism of RIG-I in combating HEV infection. We found that activation of RIG-I stimulates an antiviral response independent of IRF3 and IRF7 and regardless of IFN production. However, it is partially through activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade of IFN signaling. RIG-I activated two distinct categories of ISGs, one JAK-STAT-dependent and the other JAK-STAT-independent, which coordinately contribute to the anti-HEV activity. CONCLUSION: We identified RIG-I as an important anti-HEV ISG that can be pharmacologically activated; activation of RIG-I stimulates the cellular innate immunity against HEV regardless of IFN production but partially through the JAK-STAT cascade of IFN signaling.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 2004-2010 was used. All hospitalizations due to dental conditions were selected. The prevalence of obesity was estimated among these hospitalizations. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the impact of obesity on outcomes. A total of 11 965 hospitalizations were attributed to dental conditions; 5.6% were related to obesity. The proportion of those who were obese increased over the study period (ranging from 3.7% in 2004 to 7.3% in 2010). The mean age of those who were obese was 45 years (compared to 38.7 years for those who were not obese). Close to 41% of those who were obese were males (compared to 51% who were not obese). Whites comprised 62.4% of those who were obese (compared to 59.2% of those who were not obese). Those who were obese had a higher comorbid burden compared to those who were not obese (83.5% of those who were obese had at least one comorbid condition, whereas 56.4% of those who were not obese had at least one comorbid condition). Those who were obese had higher hospitalization charges ($US2225 more, P = 0.0001).

Ratio of apoptosis induced by evodiamine was determined by TUNEL assay. MTT assay was carried out to assess cytotoxic effect of evodiamine. The influence on expression of ERK, phospho-ERK and Bcl-2 was detected by Western blotting analysis. TUNEL assay indicated that apoptosis was the type of A375-S2 cell death induced by evodiamine treatment for 24 h. Both staurosporine (inhibitor of PKC) and PD98059 (inhibitor of ERK) cooperated with evodiamine to further induce A375-S2 cell death. Evodiamine inhibited PKC activity, down-regulated the expression of ERK, phospho-ERK and Bcl-2, and staurosporine was capable of augmenting these effects induced by evodiamine. PKC lies upstream and exhibits regulatory effect on ERK and Bcl-2 in evodiamine-induced cell death. ",0

Thus, the possibility of using a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide as a probe to identify and monitor the isolation of a specific gene was first established by model studies which defined the melting temperatures (TmS) for duplexes of oligonucleotides of different lengths and base compositions. This led to the isolation of the CYC1 locus using a synthetic 13 nucleotide probe. A more convenient strategy for determination of DNA sequences by the Sanger method was provided by using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as primers with denatured double-strand plasmid DNA as template. By this means, the sequence of the CYC1 locus was determined by """"walking"""" along the gene without isolating restriction fragments of the DNA or separating DNA strands. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, used as primers for reverse transcriptase with mRNA as template, were also used to precisely define the 5'- and 3'-ends of the iso-1-cytochrome c mRNA. Yet another application of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides is their use as specific mutagens after in vitro incorporation into double-stranded DNA. In the case of iso-1-cytochrome c, this mutagenic strategy is being used to define the role of conserved amino-acids in cytochrome function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) """,0
1832,15558739,"Sidechain biology and the immunogenicity of PDC-E2, the major autoantigen of primary biliary cirrhosis","The E2 component of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) is the immunodominant autoantigen of primary biliary cirrhosis. Whereas lipoylation of PDC-E2 is essential for enzymatic activity and predominates under normal conditions, other biochemical systems exist that also target the lysine residue, including acylation of fatty acids or xenobiotics and ubiquitinylation. More importantly, the immunogenicity can be affected by derivatization of the lysine residue, as the recognition of lipoylated PDC-E2 by patient autoantibodies is enhanced compared with octanoylated PDC-E2. Furthermore, our laboratory has shown that various xenobiotic modifications of a peptide representing the immunodominant region of PDC-E2 are immunoreactive against patient sera. The only purported regulatory system that prevents the accumulation of potentially autoreactive PDC-E2 is glutathionylation, in which the lysine-lipoic acid moiety is further modified with glutathione during apoptosis. Interestingly, this system is found in several cell lines, including HeLa, Jurkat, and Caco-2 cells, but not in cholangiocytes and salivary gland epithelial cells, both of which are targets for destruction in primary biliary cirrhosis. Hence, the failure of this or other regulatory system(s) may overwhelm the immune system with immunogenic PDC-E2 that can initiate the breakdown of tolerance in a genetically susceptible individual. In this review the authors survey the data available on the biochemical life of PDC-E2, with particular emphasis on the lysine residue and its known interactions with machinery involved in various posttranslational modifications.",0

We evaluated the efficacy of 5-nitroimidazoles (5-NI) in the treatment of giardiasis in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed-Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of 5-NI vs. control (placebo or active treatment) on parasitological cure in patients with parasitologically-demonstrated giardiasis. The search was performed in May 2013 with no language restriction by two authors independently. The efficacy outcome was parasitological cure, and harmful outcomes were abdominal pain, bitter or metallic taste, and headache. We included 30 RCTs (n?=?3,930). There was a significant and slightly higher response rate with 5-NI in giardiasis treatment (RR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.11, p?=?0.005). There was high heterogeneity among studies (I2?=?72%). The response rates for metronidazole, tinidazole and secnidazole were similar (RR 1.05, 95%CI 1.01-1.09, p?=?0.01; RR 1.32 95%CI 1.10-1.59, p?=?0.003; and RR 1.18 95%CI 0.93-1.449, p?=?0.18, respectively). On subgroup analyses, the response rates did not vary substantially and high heterogeneity persisted (I2?=?57%-80%). Harmful outcomes were uncommon, and 5-NIs were associated with lower risk of abdominal pain, and higher risk of both bitter or metallic taste and headache. CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating the efficacy of 5-NI in giardiasis treatment are highly heterogeneous. 5-NIs have a slightly better efficacy and worse profile for mild harmful outcomes in the treatment of giardiasis in comparison to controls. Larger high quality RCTs are needed to further assess efficacy and safety profiles of 5-NI.""",1
1834,15830397,A key role for autoreactive B cells in the breakdown of T-cell tolerance to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the mouse,"The key immunological event in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis is breakdown of T-cell self-tolerance to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The mechanism resulting in this breakdown of tolerance remains unclear. Mice exposed to self-PDC mount no immune response; however, animals coexposed to self-PDC and PDC of foreign origin (which in isolation induces a cross-reactive antibody but not an autoreactive T-cell response) show breakdown of T-cell as well as B-cell tolerance. This observation raises the possibility that a cross-reactive antibody response to self-PDC can promote breakdown of T-cell tolerance. The aim of this study was to address the hypothesis that breakdown of T-cell tolerance to PDC can be driven by the presence of B cells and/or antibodies cross-reactive with this self-antigen. Naive female SJL/J mice were exposed to self-PDC alone and in the presence of purified splenic B cells from animals primed with foreign PDC (or controls) or purified immunoglobulin (Ig) G from the same animals. Breakdown of T-cell tolerance was assessed by splenic T-cell proliferative response to antigen at 5 weeks. CD4(+) T-cell proliferative responses indicative of breakdown of T-cell tolerance to self-PDC were seen in the majority (7 of 9, 78%) of animals receiving self-PDC together with purified PDC-reactive B cells. Tolerance breakdown was not seen in animals receiving self-PDC with purified anti-PDC IgG or with B cells from animals sensitized with an irrelevant antigen. In conclusion, breakdown of T-cell tolerance to the highly conserved self-antigen PDC may be mediated by high-level presentation of self-derived epitopes by activated cross-reactive B cells.",0

1836,14512876,Interferon alfa down-regulates collagen gene transcription and suppresses experimental hepatic fibrosis in mice,"The equilibrium between the production and degradation of collagen is rigorously controlled by a number of growth factors and cytokines. Interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) is now widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, which can improve serum levels of fibrotic markers and the degree of hepatic fibrosis, not only in patients who responded to therapy but also in those in whom it is ineffective. These findings may suggest that IFN-alpha possesses direct antifibrotic effects in addition to its antiviral activity. However, in contrast to IFN-gamma, which has been shown to suppress collagen gene transcription, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the antifibrotic effects of IFN-alpha. Here, we report that IFN-alpha, when administered into transgenic mice harboring the alpha2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter sequence, significantly repressed promoter activation and prevented the progression of hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride injection. Transient transfection assays indicated that IFN-alpha decreased the steady-state levels of COL1A2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and inhibited basal and TGF-beta/Smad3-stimulated COL1A2 transcription in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC). These inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha on COL1A2 transcription were exerted through the interaction between phosphorylated Stat1 and p300. Blocking of the IFN-alpha signal by overexpressing the intracellular domain-deleted IFN receptor increased basal COL1A2 transcription and abolished the inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha. In conclusion, our results indicate that IFN-alpha antagonizes the TGF-beta/Smad3-stimulated COL1A2 transcription in vitro and suppresses COL1A2 promoter activation in vivo, providing a molecular basis for antifibrotic effects of IFN-alpha.",0

Base-line pulmonary-function studies were nearly all within normal limits, but after 47 to 59 days of heavy smoking, statistically significant decreases in forced expired volume in one second (3 +/- 1 per cent, S.E.), maximal mid-expiratory flow rate (11 +/- 2 per cent), plethysmographic specific airway conductance (16 +/- 2 per cent) and diffusing capacity (8 +/- 2 per cent) were noted as compared with the base-line studies. The decreases in maximal mid-expiratory flow rate and specific airway conductance were correlated with the quantity of marihuana smoked. These findings suggest that customary social use of marihuana may not result in detectable functional respiratory impairment in healthy young men, whereas very heavy marihuana smoking for six to eight weeks causes mild but statistically significant airway obstruction.",0
1838,12490491,Effects of tamoxifen on hepatic fat content and the development of hepatic steatosis in patients with breast cancer: high frequency of involvement and rapid reversal after completion of tamoxifen therapy,"""OBJECTIVE: A study was conducted on hepatic fat content to investigate the frequency and clinical course of hepatic steatosis induced by tamoxifen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen were included. The patients underwent postoperative annual abdominal CT, both with and without contrast enhancement, for 5 years. We retrospectively reviewed unenhanced CT images and obtained hepatic and splenic CT attenuation values to calculate the liver-spleen ratio. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver-spleen ratio of less than 0:9, and its degree was classified as mild (liver-spleen ratio, 0:5-0:9), moderate (0-0:5), or severe (<0). The pattern of steatosis was classified as generalized, lobar, segmental, or focal. RESULTS: In the study population, hepatic CT values decreased during therapy (p < 0.0001, t test) and increased after therapy (p < 0.0001, paired t test). Twenty-nine patients (43.2%) developed hepatic steatosis within the first 2 years; its degree was mild in 16, moderate in nine, and severe in four. Seventeen patients showed a generalized pattern of steatosis, and the other 12 showed a lobar pattern. Twenty-three of these patients showed an increase in the liver-spleen ratio after therapy to within the normal range, with a mean recovery time of 1.2 years after therapy ended. None progressed to steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen had a statistically significant influence on hepatic fat content and was associated with frequent development of hepatic steatosis. Radiologists should be aware of this phenomenon and the possible occurrence of hepatic dysfunction and should differentiate steatosis from metastasis in postoperative patients with breast cancer.""",1
1839,21991952,Adverse health outcomes in women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol,"BACKGROUND: Before 1971, several million women were exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) given to their mothers to prevent pregnancy complications. Several adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, but their cumulative effects are not well understood. METHODS: We combined data from three studies initiated in the 1970s with continued long-term follow-up of 4653 women exposed in utero to DES and 1927 unexposed controls. We assessed the risks of 12 adverse outcomes linked to DES exposure, including cumulative risks to 45 years of age for reproductive outcomes and to 55 years of age for other outcomes, and their relationships to the baseline presence or absence of vaginal epithelial changes, which are correlated with a higher dose of, and earlier exposure to, DES in utero. RESULTS: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5% (hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05 to 2.75); spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6% (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.88); preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8% (hazard ratio, 4.68; 95% CI, 3.74 to 5.86); loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7% (hazard ratio, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.56 to 5.54); ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9% (hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.58 to 5.38); preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7% (hazard ratio 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89); stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6% (hazard ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.33 to 4.54); early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7% (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.31); grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4% (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.59 to 3.27); and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2% (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.18). For most outcomes, the risks among exposed women were higher for those with vaginal epithelial changes than for those without such changes. CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure of women to DES is associated with a high lifetime risk of a broad spectrum of adverse health outcomes. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute.).",0

Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds human PDGFR? and blocks ligand binding. This phase I study assessed the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of olaratumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Patients were enrolled into five dose-escalating cohorts of 3-6 patients each. Olaratumab was administered intravenously weekly at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg (cohorts 1-3) or once every other week at 15 or 20 mg/kg (cohorts 4-5), with 4 weeks/cycle. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were treated in five cohorts. There were no dose-limiting toxicities; the MTD was not identified with the doses studied. The most common olaratumab-related adverse events (AE) were fatigue and infusion reactions (10.5 % each). With the exception of 1 patient (20 mg/kg) experiencing two grade 3 drug-related AEs after the dose-limiting toxicity assessment period, all drug-related AEs were grade 1 or 2. The trough concentrations (C min) for 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly were higher than 155 ?g/mL, and the concentration found to be efficacious in preclinical xenograft models. Twelve patients (63.2 %) had a best response of stable disease [median duration of 3.9 months (95 % CI 2.3-8.7)]. CONCLUSIONS: Olaratumab was well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity. RP2Ds are 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly. Phase II studies of olaratumab as monotherapy and in combination are ongoing in several tumor types.""",1

1842,29909447,Towards automation of glycomic profiling of complex biological materials,"Glycosylation is considered one of the most complex and structurally diverse post-translational modifications of proteins. Glycans play important roles in many biological processes such as protein folding, regulation of protein stability, solubility and serum half-life. One of the ways to study glycosylation is systematic structural characterizations of protein glycosylation utilizing glycomics methodology based around mass spectrometry (MS). The most prevalent bottleneck stages for glycomic analyses is laborious sample preparation steps. Therefore, in this study, we aim to improve sample preparations by automation. We recently demonstrated the successful application of an automated high-throughput (HT), glycan permethylation protocol based on 96-well microplates, in the analysis of purified glycoproteins. Therefore, we wanted to test if these developed HT methodologies could be applied to more complex biological starting materials. Our automated 96-well-plate based permethylation method showed very comparable results with established glycomic methodology. Very similar glycomic profiles were obtained for complex glycoprotein/protein mixtures derived from heterogeneous mouse tissues. Automated N-glycan release, enrichment and automated permethylation of samples proved to be convenient, robust and reliable. Therefore we conclude that these automated procedures are a step forward towards the development of a fully automated, fast and reliable glycomic profiling system for analysis of complex biological materials.

1843,15056811,Ethyl acrylate risk assessment with a hybrid computational fluid dynamics and physiologically based nasal dosimetry model,"Cytotoxicity in the nasal epithelium is frequently observed in rodents exposed to volatile organic acids and esters by inhalation. An interspecies, hybrid computational fluid dynamics and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (CFD-PBPK) dosimetry model for inhaled ethyl acrylate (EA) is available for estimating internal dose measures for EA, its metabolite acrylic acid (AA), and EA-mediated reductions in tissue glutathione (GSH). Nasal tissue concentrations of AA were previously used as the dose metric for a chronic Reference Concentration (RfC) calculation with this compound. However, EA was more toxic than expected, based on calculated tissue AA concentrations. Unlike AA, EA causes depletion of tissue GSH. We have developed an RfC for EA using tissue GSH depletion in the olfactory epithelium as the primary measure of nasal tissue dose. The hybrid CFD-PBPK model was refined to improve the accuracy of simulations for GSH in rat olfactory tissues. This refined model was used to determine the concentration for continuous human exposures to EA predicted to reduce nasal GSH levels to the same extent as seen in rats exposed to EA at the no-observed-effect level (NOEL). Importantly, AA concentrations in the human nasal olfactory epithelium at the proposed chronic RfC were predicted to be lower than the AA concentrations estimated in the rat at the NOEL. Thus, a chronic RfC based on maintaining GSH in the human nasal olfactory epithelium at levels equivalent to the rat NOEL would also provide an adequate margin of safety with respect to AA concentrations in nasal tissues.

Fifteen patients were randomized to each treatment. Responses were assessed based on changes in pulmonary and clinical scores, white blood cell counts, pulmonary function tests and quantitative bacteriology of sputum which were performed before, every 5 to 7 days during and on the last day of therapy. Patients in both groups responded to therapy and there were no statistically significant differences in changes in the above indicators of response with therapy between the two groups (P greater than 0.05). The incidence of detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to all three study antibiotics increased with therapy. Side effects were limited to transient elevations of liver enzymes (both groups) and rash and fever in one patient treated with azlocillin. Aztreonam represents effective therapy for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis associated with susceptible pathogens.",1

Compared with the amount of the whole lipidfraction, the very low concentrated NEFA may indicate the status of the endogenous delivery of energy-substrates only when analyzed with a high efficient selective, quantitative and direct method. The main question of the presented investigations on 14 surgical patients was the influence of an acute event of aggression on quality and quantity of fatty acid mobilization. After detailed characterization of experimental methodological conditions, the concentration-profiles and amounts of the mobilized NEFA and their modifications by the stress-reaction are reported.

A 66-year-old female was admitted for rehabilitation of a cerebral hemorrhage on September 11, 1981. Allopurinol, clofibrate, and baclofen were administered. Severe hepatitis developed on November 13. The clinical laboratory data returned to normal on November 30. Challenge tests were conducted on clofibrate, allopurinol, and baclofen.

However, the cellular and molecular bases for these changes are still not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that IUGR is associated with structural and functional gene expression changes in the fetal sarcomere cytoarchitecture, which remain present in adulthood. IUGR was induced in New Zealand pregnant rabbits by selective ligation of the utero-placental vessels. Fetal echocardiography demonstrated more globular hearts and signs of cardiac dysfunction in IUGR. Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM) showed shorter sarcomere length and shorter A-band and thick-thin filament interaction lengths, that were already present in utero and persisted at 70 postnatal days (adulthood). Sarcomeric M-band (GO: 0031430) functional term was over-represented in IUGR fetal hearts. The results suggest that IUGR induces cardiac dysfunction and permanent changes on the sarcomere. ",0

Left ventricular pressure (LVP), aortic pressure, and aortic flow velocity were measured. The time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau) was determined by means of linear regression of the natural logarithm of LVP and by means of direct measurement from the LVP-versus-time curve. Sotalol was administered IV at cumulative doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg to 6 dogs; the other 6 were used as controls. Mean systolic aortic pressure was used to assess afterload, and maximal rate of increase in LVP versus time (dP/dt) was used as an index of contractility. After administration of the first dose of sotalol, tau was increased significantly, and maximum dP/dt was decreased significantly, compared with baseline values. Administration of additional doses of sotalol did not result in any additional change in tau, but maximum dP/dt increased, and maximum dP/dt after administration of the final dose of sotalol was significantly higher than maximum dP/dt after administration of the first dose. There were no significant changes in mean systolic aortic pressure. In healthy dogs, sotalol did not have any negative effect on myocardial relaxation beyond those attributable to its beta-blocking properties, despite an increase in intracellular ionized calcium concentration, as suggested by an increase in maximum dP/dt after an initial decrease.

1855,7074431,Liver lesions and oral contraceptives,"The association of cavernous hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hemangiomatosis of the liver has not previously been described in the literature. A case report of a patient who presented with these 3 lesions simultaneously is reviewed. The 32-year-old obese woman presented with upper abdominal pain of recent onset. No liver abnormality had been noted at the times of cholecystectomy and cesarean section, each performed some years before. She had taken oral contraceptives (OCs) 6 years earlier for about 6 months. Now the liver was enlarged and contained a firm, nontender mass that extended to 1 handsbreadth below the right costal margin and across the epigastrium. No bruit was noted. Results of hematologic and biochemical investigations were within normal limits. Ultrasonography revealed a solic mass, and selective celiac arteriography showed that the mass occupied the right lobe of the liver and was predominantly avascular, with small areas of pooling of contrast material. An operation revealed, in addition to the mass, many irregular purplish areas 2-4 mm in diameter in both lobes of the liver. Close to the free edge of the left lobe was a yellowish brown and slightly modular firm mass. The pathological report listed a giant cavernous hemangioma of the right lobe, several disseminated cavernous hemangiomata, multiple disseminated vascular ectasiae (hemangiomatosis) and 1 lesion of focal nodular hyperplasia in the left lobe. 27 days after the operation, scintiscanning revealed evidence of good liver regeneration. Another scan 3 years later revealed regeneration of the liver to normal size and no focal abnormalities. Due to the fact that increasing numbers of cases of focal nodular hyperplasia and liver cell adenomas have been reported in association with OCs and in view of the possible association between these drugs and hemangioma, caution in prescribing these drugs is recommended.",1
1856,11513736,Evidence for a novel natriuretic peptide receptor that prefers brain natriuretic peptide over atrial natriuretic peptide,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) exert their physiological actions by binding to natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA), a receptor guanylate cyclase (rGC) that synthesizes cGMP in response to both ligands. The family of rGCs is rapidly expanding, and it is plausible that there might be additional, as yet undiscovered, rGCs whose function is to provide alternative signalling pathways for one or both of these peptides, particularly given the low affinity of NPRA for BNP. We have investigated this hypothesis, using a genetically modified (knockout) mouse in which the gene encoding NPRA has been disrupted. Enzyme assays and NPRA-specific Western blots performed on tissues from wild-type mice demonstrate that ANP-activated cGMP synthesis provides a good index of NPRA protein expression, which ranges from maximal in adrenal gland, lung, kidney, and testis to minimal in heart and colon. In contrast, immunoreactive NPRA is not detectable in tissues isolated from NPRA knockout animals and ANP- and BNP-stimulatable GC activities are markedly reduced in all mutant tissues. However, testis and adrenal gland retain statistically significant, high-affinity responses to BNP. This residual response to BNP cannot be accounted for by natriuretic peptide receptor B, or any other known mammalian rGC, suggesting the presence of a novel receptor in these tissues that prefers BNP over ANP.

1857,23034020,"C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and cardiovascular disease prediction","""BACKGROUND: There is debate about the value of assessing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other biomarkers of inflammation for the prediction of first cardiovascular events. METHODS: We analyzed data from 52 prospective studies that included 246,669 participants without a history of cardiovascular disease to investigate the value of adding CRP or fibrinogen levels to conventional risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular risk. We calculated measures of discrimination and reclassification during follow-up and modeled the clinical implications of initiation of statin therapy after the assessment of CRP or fibrinogen. RESULTS: The addition of information on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a prognostic model for cardiovascular disease that included age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol level increased the C-index, a measure of risk discrimination, by 0.0050. The further addition to this model of information on CRP or fibrinogen increased the C-index by 0.0039 and 0.0027, respectively (P<0.001), and yielded a net reclassification improvement of 1.52% and 0.83%, respectively, for the predicted 10-year risk categories of """"low"""" (<10%), """"intermediate"""" (10% to <20%), and """"high"""" (?20%) (P<0.02 for both comparisons). We estimated that among 100,000 adults 40 years of age or older, 15,025 persons would initially be classified as being at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event if conventional risk factors alone were used to calculate risk. Assuming that statin therapy would be initiated in accordance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (i.e., for persons with a predicted risk of ?20% and for those with certain other risk factors, such as diabetes, irrespective of their 10-year predicted risk), additional targeted assessment of CRP or fibrinogen levels in the 13,199 remaining participants at intermediate risk could help prevent approximately 30 additional cardiovascular events over the course of 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of people without known cardiovascular disease, we estimated that under current treatment guidelines, assessment of the CRP or fibrinogen level in people at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event could help prevent one additional event over a period of 10 years for every 400 to 500 people screened.

Two groups of 46 patients who received intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (group 1, 0.05 mL) or bevacizumab-triamcinolone acetate (TA) combination (group 2, 0.1 mL) were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging with Visante OCT and IOP measurement before and at 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours after injection. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), angle-opening distance (AOD 500-750), trabecular-iris space area (TISA 500-750), and anterior chamber angle (ACA) were measured. Results were compared between groups and measurement time points. The mean change in IOP showed significant difference between baseline and first measurements after the injection in group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.012, p = 0.008, respectively). There was a statistically significant difference from baseline in ACD at the first and second measurements in group 2 (p = 0.005, p = 0.018, respectively). All angle parameters showed insignificant decrease from baseline at all measurement time points in both groups (p>0.05 for each). The difference of angle parameters after injection was not statistically significant between the groups (p>0.05 for each). Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (0.05 mL) or bevacizumab-TA combination (0.1 mL) caused a change in anterior segment configuration determined by AS-OCT.

1859,16622909,Adverse effects of antifungal therapies in invasive fungal infections: review and meta-analysis,"""Amphotericin B is the main therapeutic agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections; however, it is associated with significant toxicities that limit its use. Other systemic antifungal agents have been developed to improve tolerability while maintaining the efficacy profile of conventional amphotericin B. Fifty-four studies involving 9,228 patients were assessed for the frequency of adverse effects of the main systemic antifungal agents. While the results suggest that liposomal amphotericin B is the least nephrotoxic of the lipid formulations (14.6%), that conventional amphotericin B is the most nephrotoxic (33.2%), and that itraconazole is the most hepatotoxic (31.5%), the lack of standard definitions of antifungal-related adverse effects limits the validity of these results. Furthermore, heterogeneous patient pools and differing protocols make it difficult to draw direct comparisons between studies. With the advent of newer classes of systemic antifungal agents, future trials should conform to definitions that are universally applicable and clinically relevant to allow for such comparisons and to enable evidence-based decision-making.""",1

Early-stage disease responds to antibiotics, suggesting a bacterial origin. We attempted to identify a causative agent. METHODS: We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical studies on intestinal-biopsy specimens from a series of patients with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. RESULTS: Analysis of frozen intestinal tissue obtained from an index patient with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease who had a dramatic response to antibiotics revealed the presence of Campylobacter jejuni. A follow-up retrospective analysis of archival intestinal-biopsy specimens disclosed campylobacter species in four of six additional patients with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.

1861,25207766,Targetable kinase-activating lesions in Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by a gene-expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, alterations of lymphoid transcription factor genes, and a poor outcome. The frequency and spectrum of genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL and its responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibition are undefined, especially in adolescents and adults. METHODS: We performed genomic profiling of 1725 patients with precursor B-cell ALL and detailed genomic analysis of 154 patients with Ph-like ALL. We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL. RESULTS: Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 91% of patients with Ph-like ALL; rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B, TSLP, or TYK2 and sequence mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, or SH2B3 were most common. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL are needed to assess whether adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to current therapy will improve the survival of patients with this type of leukemia.

Since it is COX-2 preferential, it would be expected to have less gastrointestinal toxicity than non-selective NSAIDs. In clinical trials of meloxicam in osteoarthritis, it was found to be as effective as piroxicam, diclofenac and naproxen with less clinical gastrointestinal symptoms and less perforations, obstructions and bleeds by meta-analysis.

Betaine, a naturally occurring metabolite of choline, has been shown to raise S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels that may in turn play a role in decreasing hepatic steatosis. Our aim was to determine the safety and effects of betaine on liver biochemistries and histological markers of disease activity in patients with NASH. METHODS: Ten adult patients with NASH were enrolled. Patients received betaine anhydrous for oral solution (Cystadane) in two divided doses daily for 12 months. Seven out of 10 patients completed 1 yr of treatment with betaine. RESULTS: A significant improvement in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.02) and ALAT (p = 0.007) occurred during treatment. Aminotransferases normalized in three of seven patients, decreased by >50% in three of seven patients, and remained unchanged in one patient when compared to baseline values. A marked improvement in serum levels of aminotransferases (ALT -39%; AST -38%) also occurred during treatment in those patients who did not complete 1 yr of treatment. Similarly, a marked improvement in the degree of steatosis, necroinflammatory grade, and stage of fibrosis was noted at 1 yr of treatment with betaine. Transitory GI adverse events that did not require any dose reduction or discontinuation of betaine occurred in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Betaine is a safe and well tolerated drug that leads to a significant biochemical and histological improvement in patients with NASH. This novel agent deserves further evaluation in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.""",1

Bepridil is an antianginal-antiarrhythmic agent with vasodilator and direct cardiac inotropic effects. Sodium valproate has anticonvulsant activity and causes use-dependent inhibition of repetitive firing in CNS neurons. Bepridil and sodium valproate caused a dose-dependent decrease in maximum Na+ conductance (KD = 25 microM for bepridil; KD = 0.5 mM for valproate). More importantly, at half-maximal blocking concentrations both drugs shifted steady state Na+ inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction (by 30 mV for bepridil; 15 mV for valproate) and slowed the recovery of Na+ channels from inactivation (by 300% for bepridil; 60% for valproate).

1869,15084693,Use of gene-expression profiling to identify prognostic subclasses in adult acute myeloid leukemia,"BACKGROUND: In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the presence or absence of recurrent cytogenetic aberrations is used to identify the appropriate therapy. However, the current classification system does not fully reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the disease, and treatment stratification is difficult, especially for patients with intermediate-risk AML with a normal karyotype. METHODS: We used complementary-DNA microarrays to determine the levels of gene expression in peripheral-blood samples or bone marrow samples from 116 adults with AML (including 45 with a normal karyotype). We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis to identify molecular subgroups with distinct gene-expression signatures. Using a training set of samples from 59 patients, we applied a novel supervised learning algorithm to devise a gene-expression-based clinical-outcome predictor, which we then tested using an independent validation group comprising the 57 remaining patients. RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis identified new molecular subtypes of AML, including two prognostically relevant subgroups in AML with a normal karyotype. Using the supervised learning algorithm, we constructed an optimal 133-gene clinical-outcome predictor, which accurately predicted overall survival among patients in the independent validation group (P=0.006), including the subgroup of patients with AML with a normal karyotype (P=0.046). In multivariate analysis, the gene-expression predictor was a strong independent prognostic factor (odds ratio, 8.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 29.3; P<0.001).

Here, we used a mice model to characterize some immunological mechanisms involved in host resistance to infection with such strains. We have chosen the Type I/III strains D8, G2 and P-Br, which cause a chronic infection in mice that resembles human toxoplamosis. Mice deficient of molecules MyD88, IFN-gamma, and IL-12 were susceptible to all three parasite strains. This finding indicates the importance of innate mechanisms in controlling infection. On the other hand, MHC haplotype did not influenced resistance/susceptibility; since mice lineages displaying a same genetic background but different MHC haplotypes (H2b or H2d) developed similar mortality and cyst numbers after infection with those strains. In contrast, the C57BL/6 genetic background, and not MHC haplotype, was critical for development of intestinal inflammation caused by any of the studied strains. Finally, regarding effector mechanisms, we observed that B and CD8+ T lymphocytes controlled survival,whereas the inducible nitric oxide synthase influenced cyst numbers in brains of mice infected with Type I/III strains. These findings are relevant to further understanding of the immunologic mechanisms involved in host protection and pathogenesis during infection with T. gondii. ",0

METHODS: Diet or tablet-treated patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 256; age 40-75 years, body mass index (BMI) 20-35 kg/m2, HbA1c 4.2-12.8%), without signs of severe microvascular or macrovascular complications, were included in this double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group comparative trial. Patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to repaglinide, 1-4 mg at mealtimes, or glipizide, 5-15 mg daily. RESULTS: Changes in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c during the 12 months of treatment showed a significant difference in favour of repaglinide. In oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA)-naive patients, HbA1c decreased in the repaglinide and glipizide groups by 1.5% and 0.3%, respectively (P < 0.05 between groups). Fasting blood glucose decreased in the repaglinide group by 2.4 mmol/l and increased in the glipizide group by 1.0 mmol/l (P < 0.05 between groups). In the study population as a whole, repaglinide was able to maintain glycaemic control (HbA1c level) during the 1-year study period, whereas control deteriorated significantly with glipizide. Change in HbA1c from baseline was significantly better with repaglinide than with glipizide after 12 months (P < 0.05). In addition, FBG deteriorated significantly in the glipizide group compared with the repaglinide group (P < 0.05). No patients in either group experienced a major hypoglycaemic event; the number of patients experiencing minor hypoglycaemia was similar in the repaglinide and glipizide groups (15% and 19%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide, given as a prandial glucose regulator, is shown to be an effective and safe treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes, and is better than glipizide in controlling HbA1c and FBG levels, overall, and in OHA-naive patients.""",1

Included in the present study were only those patients who underwent surgical intervention, and thus data for 57 patients were analyzed. Seventy-three aneurysms in 57 patients were surgically treated. There was a slight female predominance (M/F 1:1.2), and the mean age among all patients was 12.69 ± 3.75 years. Fifty patients (87.72%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 4 (7.02%) with mass effect, and 3 (5.26%) with seizure. On presentation the majority of patients (45 [78.95%]) had a good clinical grade. Eleven patients had multiple aneurysms. The internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation was the most common aneurysm site (18 cases [24.66%]), followed by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation (11 cases [15.07%]). At a mean follow-up of 18.58 ± 10.71 months (range 1.5-44 months), 44 patients (77.19%) had a favorable outcome, and 5 patients had died. Pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms most commonly presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and there was a slight female predominance. The ICA bifurcation followed by the MCA bifurcation was the most common aneurysm site. The incidence of posterior circulation and giant aneurysms is higher in pediatric patients than in the adult population. Children tend to present with better clinical grades and have better overall survival results and good functional outcomes. ",0
1874,1532337,IgE binding inhibits arachidonic acid-induced chemiluminescence of human platelets,"Arachidonic acid (AA)-induced chemiluminescence (CHL) was studied in vitro by means of a luminometer in platelets from nine healthy volunteers and six allergic patients. The amplitude of the CHL signal increased with AA concentration from 250 microM to 7 mM. At a low AA concentration (250 microM), the CHL signal consisted of two peaks. The first one occurred at 6 +/- 3 sec and the second one at 90 +/- 15 sec (n = 9). The mean amplitude of these peaks was 1.95 +/- 0.61 mV/sec and 0.82 +/- 0.22 mV/sec for normal subjects, and 2.35 +/- 0.62 mV/sec and 0.78 +/- 0.26 mV/sec for allergic patients, respectively. Aspirin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and baicalein (a lipoxygenase inhibitor) reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, the first and second peak, respectively. The binding of immunoglobulin E (IgE) alone to platelets from both normal and allergic subjects inhibited both the first and second peak of AA-induced CHL. This inhibitory effect was specifically due to the action of IgE as it was (i) concentration-dependent and (ii) not observed when immunoglobulin G (IgG) was substituted for IgE. It is concluded that in normal subjects, as well as in allergic patients, the binding of IgE alone to its specific receptor on human platelets could alter arachidonate metabolism that probably involves cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.

1875,646570,Allopurinol-induced granulomatous hepatitis with cholangitis and a sarcoid-like reaction,"""A 36-year-old man had pain in both knees and an elevated uric acid concentration; his liver function was normal. Allopurinol therapy was started, 100 mg twice daily. After one month fever, lethargy, and severe polyarthralgia developed. On admission to our hospital liver function was abnormal, and a liver biopsy specimen showed granulomas with cholangitis and pericholangitis. He also had lymphopenia with a reduced number of T cells and granulomas in the bone marrow. One month after discontinuation of allopurinol therapy the patient was clinically well with normal liver function and a normal lymphocyte count. A repeated liver biopsy specimen showed normal liver tissue with no granulomas. The onset of the symptoms and findings shortly after the initiation of allopurinol therapy, and their disappearance after the discontinuation of therapy suggest a drug-induced hypersensitivity.""",1
1876,8847135,"Expression of estrogen, progesterone and epidermal growth factor receptors in primary and metastatic breast cancer","The prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and its biological role in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and ER-negative (ER-) primary breast cancer is controversial. In this study, distributions of ER, progesterone receptor and EGFR have been established using immunohistochemistry in both primary breast tumors and their matched axillary lymph node metastases of 26 patients or their matched distant metastases of 2 patients. In addition, 5 patients with bilateral breast cancer were studied. ER+ tumor cells were detected in 22 (69%) and EGFR+ tumor cells were detected in 11 (34%) primary breast carcinomas. Expression of ER and EGFR was inverse regarding the individual tumor cells in both primary tumors and metastases. Relationship of EGFR expression with poorly differentiated and large breast tumors was observed. Furthermore, primary tumors with a predominant lobular component were ER+ and, with one exception, EGFR-. Invasive ductal carcinomas were more frequently EGFR+. No apparent differences in receptor expression were observed between primary tumors and lymph node metastases or chronously or metachronously occurring bilateral breast cancers. Only one ER+ primary tumor showed a switch to EGFR expression in the involved lymph node. Our study shows that a shift in receptor phenotype between primary tumors and lymph node metastases is a rare event and, thus, additional analyses of involved lymph nodes will not likely serve as a better predictor for response to anti-estrogen therapy. We conclude that expression of EGFR is not a prerequisite for development of metastases. ",0
1877,16628626,Genomic response to interferon-alpha in chimpanzees: implications of rapid downregulation for hepatitis C kinetics,"The mechanism of the interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-induced antiviral response during hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy is n o t completely understood. In this study,we examined the transcriptional response to IFN-alpha in uninfected chimpanzees after single doses of chimpanzee, human, or human-pegylated IFN-alpha. Liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were used for total genome microarray analysis. Most induced genes achieved maximal response within 4 hours, began to decline by 8 hours, and were at baseline levels by 24 hours postinoculation, a time when high levels of circulating pegylated IFN-alpha were still present. The rapid downregulation of the IFN-alpha response may be involved in the transition between the observed phase I and phase II viral kinetics during IFN-alpha therapy in HCV-infected patients. The response to all three forms of IFN-alpha was similar; thus, the reasons for previous failures in antiviral treatment of chimpanzees with human IFN-alpha were not due to species specificity of IFN-alpha. The response to IFN-alpha was partially tissue-specific. A total of 1778 genes were altered in expression by twofold or more by IFN-alpha, with 538 and 950 being unique to the liver or PBMC, respectively. Analysis of the IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma responses in primary chimpanzee and human hepatocytes were compared as well. IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma induced partially overlapping sets of genes in hepatocytes. In conclusion, the response to IFN-alpha is largely tissue-specific, and the response is rapidly downregulated in vivo, which may have a significant influence on the kinetics of antiviral response.",0

OBJECTIVE: To compare safety and the completion rate of the 4-month daily rifampicin regimen (4R) vs. the standard 6-month daily isoniazid regimen (6H) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in prison inmates. DESIGN: This was an open-label randomised trial among human immunodeficiency virus negative male inmates. Inmates without active tuberculosis (TB) who tested positive for both the tuberculin skin test and QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold In-Tube were eligible, but those with baseline glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels >/= 120 U/l, bilirubin levels >/= 2.4 U/l or a platelet count < 150 k/mm(3) were excluded. The primary endpoint was any adverse event that resulted in discontinuation of LTBI treatment. RESULTS: Participants (n = 373; 14% hepatitis B surface antigen positive, 21% anti-hepatitis C virus [HCV] positive) were randomised (stratified by hepatitis B virus, HCV status and 2-year prison term) to receive either 4R or 6H under directly observed treatment. The 4R group (n = 190) was less likely to experience an adverse event leading to discontinuation of treatment (2% vs. 12%, P < 0.001 for all adverse events; 0% vs. 8%, P < 0.001 for hepatotoxicity), and more likely to complete LTBI treatment (86% vs. 78%, P = 0.041), compared with the 6H group (n = 183). CONCLUSIONS: 4R is safer and has a higher completion rate than 6H as treatment for LTBI among male prison inmates.""",1
1880,19789166,Nitrofurantoin-induced acute liver damage in pregnancy,"This article presents a rare case of acute toxic hepatitis in thirty-one-year old primigravida. In the 36th week of gestation, the patient was introduced nitrofurantoin 100 mg a day due to symptoms of dysuria and enterococcus isolated from urine culture. After induced delivery at term because of hypertension, repeated laboratory findings showed increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and negative hepatitis C and B markers. The patient was subicteric at the time. Coagulation and complete blood count values were within the normal range. Nitrofurantoin therapy was discontinued. Abdominal ultrasound was normal with the exception of a slight hepatomegaly without any lesions, focal or diffuse. Given that discontinuation of nitrofurantoin and introduction of methylprednisolon therapy significantly lowered liver enzyme levels, restoring most of them to normal, we concluded that this was probably the case of toxic liver damage caused by nitrofurantoin.",1
1881,12490682,Effect of dialysis dose and membrane flux in maintenance hemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: The effects of the dose of dialysis and the level of flux of the dialyzer membrane on mortality and morbidity among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are uncertain. METHODS: We undertook a randomized clinical trial in 1846 patients undergoing thrice-weekly dialysis, using a two-by-two factorial design to assign patients randomly to a standard or high dose of dialysis and to a low-flux or high-flux dialyzer. RESULTS: In the standard-dose group, the mean (+/-SD) urea-reduction ratio was 66.3+/-2.5 percent, the single-pool Kt/V was 1.32+/-0.09, and the equilibrated Kt/V was 1.16+/-0.08; in the high-dose group, the values were 75.2+/-2.5 percent, 1.71+/-0.11, and 1.53+/-0.09, respectively. Flux, estimated on the basis of beta2-microglobulin clearance, was 3+/-7 ml per minute in the low-flux group and 34+/-11 ml per minute in the high-flux group. The primary outcome, death from any cause, was not significantly influenced by the dose or flux assignment: the relative risk of death in the high-dose group as compared with the standard-dose group was 0.96 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.10; P=0.53), and the relative risk of death in the high-flux group as compared with the low-flux group was 0.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.05; P=0.23). The main secondary outcomes (first hospitalization for cardiac causes or death from any cause, first hospitalization for infection or death from any cause, first 15 percent decrease in the serum albumin level or death from any cause, and all hospitalizations not related to vascular access) also did not differ significantly between either the dose groups or the flux groups. Possible benefits of the dose or flux interventions were suggested in two of seven prespecified subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing hemodialysis thrice weekly appear to have no major benefit from a higher dialysis dose than that recommended by current U.S. guidelines or from the use of a high-flux membrane.",0
1882,26258855,Acute Strength Training Increases Responses to Stimulation of Corticospinal Axons,"Acute strength training of forearm muscles increases resting twitch forces from motor cortex stimulation. It is unclear if such effects are spinal in origin and if they also occur with training of larger muscles. With the use of subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons, the current study examined if one session of strength training of the elbow flexor muscles leads to spinal cord changes and if the type of training is important. In experiment 1, 10 subjects completed ballistic isometric training, ballistic concentric training, and no training (control) on separate days. In experiment 2, 13 subjects completed ballistic isometric training and slow-ramp isometric training. Before and after training, transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the resting biceps brachii, and electrical stimulation of corticospinal tract axons at the cervicomedullary junction elicited cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs). Motor-evoked potential and CMEP twitch forces were also measured. In experiment 1, CMEPs and CMEP twitch forces were significantly facilitated after ballistic isometric training compared to control. In experiment 2, MEPs, MEP twitch forces, CMEPs, and CMEP twitch forces increased for 15 to 25 min after ballistic and slow-ramp isometric training. Via processes within the spinal cord, one session of strength training of the elbow flexors increases net output from motoneurons projecting to the trained muscles. Likely mechanisms include increased efficacy of corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses or increased motoneuron excitability. However, the rate of force generation during training is not important for inducing these changes. A concomitant increase in motor cortical excitability is likely. These short-term changes may represent initial neural adaptations to strength training. ",0

1884,9731577,Dissection of human humoral immune response against hepatitis C virus E2 glycoprotein by repertoire cloning and generation of recombinant Fab fragments,"Demonstration of antibodies inhibiting key viral functions is the basis for the design of an effective vaccine. Dissection of the human antibody response by repertoire cloning may be a powerful means to address this issue. In this study, a panel of human monoclonal recombinant Fab fragments specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 envelope protein was generated. The selection procedure was designed to select for cross-genotype reactive antibodies. Sequences coding five different human recombinant Fabs specific for the HCV/E2 protein were cloned and characterized. The ability of the cloned antibody fragments to inhibit adhesion of recombinant envelope E2 protein to target cells was assayed. While affinity of the different antibody fragments appeared similar, activity in inhibiting E2 binding to target cells varied considerably from one Fab fragment to another. Two Fabs were not able to inhibit E2 binding at high concentration (40 microg/mL), while three other Fab clones were active in neutralizing 50% of the E2 binding at concentrations ranging from 3 to 0.35 microg/mL.",0

METHODS: With the use of data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, we examined sex and racial differences in the treatment of patients who were deemed to be """"ideal candidates"""" for particular treatments and in deaths among 598,911 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction between 1994 and 2002. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analysis, sex and racial differences were observed for rates of reperfusion therapy (for white men, white women, black men, and black women: 86.5, 83.3, 80.4, and 77.8 percent, respectively; P<0.001), use of aspirin (84.4, 78.7, 83.7, and 78.4 percent, respectively; P<0.001), use of beta-blockers (66.6, 62.9, 67.8, and 64.5 percent; P<0.001), and coronary angiography (69.1, 55.9, 64.0, and 55.0 percent; P<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, racial and sex differences persisted for rates of reperfusion therapy (risk ratio for white women, black men, and black women: 0.97, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively, as compared with white men) and coronary angiography (relative risk, 0.91, 0.82, and 0.76) but were attenuated for the use of aspirin (risk ratio, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.94) and beta-blockers (risk ratio, 0.98, 1.00, and 0.96); all risks were unchanged over time. Adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar among white women (risk ratio, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.07) and black men (risk ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.00), as compared with white men, but was higher among black women (risk ratio, 1.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.16) and was unchanged over time.

In general these agents were not active against the solid cell growth, i.e. KB, skin, HCT-8 ileum, colon, bronchogenic lung, osteosarcoma and glioma. The mode of action of the derivatives involves inhibition of de novo purine synthesis of Tmolt-3 cells, which reduces DNA and RNA syntheses. Purine synthesis was reduced by compound 16 at both regulatory enzymes, i.e. PRPP amido transferase, IMP dehydrogenase and dihydrofolate reductase. The agent lowered d(GTP) and d(CTP) pool levels, further reducing DNA synthesis. DNA strand scission was evident after incubation with Compound 16 for 24 hr at 100 microM and some undefined interaction between the drug and the nucleoside bases appeared to occur, lowering DNA synthesis and causing cell death.

1887,9187068,Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after induction chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor PO1 CA-20180ilgrastim) hastens the recovery from neutropenia after P30 CA-21765emotherapy, but its role in the management of childhood leukemia is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned 164 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (age range, 2 months to 17 years) to receive placebo or G-CSF (10 microg per kilogram of body weight per day subcutaneously), beginning one day after the completion of remission-induction therapy and continuing until the neutrophil count was greater than or equal to 1000 per cubic millimeter for two days. The clinical and laboratory effects of this therapy were documented for 21 days. The area under the plasma G-CSF concentration-time curve was measured on days 1 and 7 in both groups. RESULTS: Responses to the growth factor could be assessed in 148 patients (73 in the G-CSF group and 75 in the placebo group). G-CSF treatment did not significantly lower the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (58 percent in the G-CSF group vs. 68 percent in the placebo group; relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.16), increase the likelihood of event-free survival at three years (83 percent in both groups), or decrease the number of severe infections (five in the G-CSF group vs. six in the placebo group). Patients treated with G-CSF had shorter median hospital stays (6 days vs. 10 days, P=0.011) and fewer documented infections (12 vs. 27, P=0.009). The median total costs of supportive care were similar in the G-CSF and placebo groups ($8,768 and $8,616, respectively). Among patients who did not have febrile neutropenia during the first week of G-CSF or placebo injections, higher systemic exposure to the growth factor on day 7 was significantly related to a lower probability of subsequent hospitalization (P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF treatment had some clinical benefit in children who received induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but it did not reduce the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, prolong survival, or reduce the cost of supportive care.",0
1888,31411376,Effect of Meal Acceptability on Postprandial Appetite Scores and Hormones of Male Participants with Varied Adiposity,"This study portrays the effect of hedonic manipulation (high acceptability [HA] vs. low acceptability [LA]) on postprandial hormones and appetite scores in healthy males. Thirty participants (15 with normal weight and 15 with obesity) were recruited for a randomized, crossover design. They were randomly assigned to the HA or LA (with acesulfame-K) custard. Blood samples were drawn before the meals and for 4 hours after the meals and were analyzed for glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1). Appetite scores and subsequent energy intake were recorded. Postprandial glucose, insulin, and ghrelin were different according to adiposity, whereas meal acceptability did not correspond to any significant difference in postprandial glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and GLP-1 concentrations. Appetite scores showed lower hunger, higher satiety, and fullness after the HA meal without a significant difference between the meals. Subsequent energy intake, expressed as a percentage of the resting energy expenditure, was higher in participants with obesity but did not reflect postprandial hormones and appetite scores; there was no significant difference between meals. Hedonic properties and palatability do not affect gut hormones, mainly ghrelin and GLP-1. Moreover, their postprandial concentrations were not paralleled by similar changes in appetite scores, and both were not found to affect subsequent intake. ",0

METHOD: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation were randomly assigned to daily brexpiprazole at a dosage of 0.25, 2, or 4 mg or placebo (1:2:2:2) for 6 weeks. Outcomes included change from baseline to week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (primary endpoint measure), Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) severity score (key secondary endpoint measure), and other efficacy and tolerability measures. RESULTS: The baseline overall mean PANSS total score was 95.2, and the CGI severity score was 4.9. Study completion rates were 62.2%, 68.1%, and 67.2% for patients in the 0.25-, 2-, and 4-mg brexpiprazole groups, respectively, versus 59.2% in the placebo group. At week 6, compared with placebo, brexpiprazole dosages of 2 and 4 mg produced statistically significantly greater reductions in PANSS total score (treatment differences: -8.72 and -7.64, respectively) and CGI severity score (treatment differences: -0.33 and -0.38). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event for brexpiprazole was akathisia (2 mg: 4.4%; 4 mg: 7.2%; placebo: 2.2%). Weight gain with brexpiprazole was moderate (1.45 and 1.28 kg for 2 and 4 mg, respectively, versus 0.42 kg for placebo at week 6). There were no clinically or statistically significant changes from baseline in lipid and glucose levels and extrapyramidal symptom ratings.

1891,24030232,Liver complications in inflammatory bowel diseases,"Diseases of the liver and the biliary tract are commonly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Besides primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), drug-induced hepatotoxicity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the most frequent liver complications in IBD. PSC is a chronic inflammatory and commonly progressive disorder of unknown etiology associated with fibrosis and stricture development in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Interestingly, this form of liver disease is mainly associated with ulcerative colitis. Development of PSC is highly relevant for IBD patients as cholestasis-associated problems increase over time resulting in biliary strictures, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and importantly these patients also have a higher risk to develop colon cancer. Another major aspect regarding IBD and liver disease refers to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Clinically, most relevant is liver toxicity caused by immunosuppressants such as azathioprine. Azathioprine and its derivate 6-mercaptopurine can cause a spectrum of liver injuries ranging from asymptomatic elevated liver enzymes to cholestasis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. The third common IBD-associated liver disease is NAFLD, and first studies suggest that NAFLD might appear in IBD patients independent of classical risk factors such as obesity or insulin resistance. Overall, liver complications are observed in 10-20% of IBD patients, and therefore physicians have to be familiar with these complications to improve and to optimize patient care.",1
1892,28942404,Successful treatment using rituximab in a patient with refractory polymyositis complicated by scleroderma renal crisis,"Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory myopathies. Myositis can be a clinical feature of scleroderma (polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome), and treatment of this syndrome is a challenge for clinicians because moderate to high doses of corticosteroids are considered a risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in affected patients. We report here the case of a 56-year-old woman with scleroderma who developed polymyositis and was successfully treated with rituximab. Initial treatment of the polymyositis with prednisolone 40 mg/day was rapidly tapered to 2.5 mg/day due to development of scleroderma renal crisis, for which four weekly infusions of rituximab (500 mg; off-label) were given. She responded well to rituximab in addition to prednisolone 2.5 mg/day. Rituximab may improve inflammatory myopathies, even in cases where high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided due to complications. Rituximab should be considered as a treatment option in cases of refractory polymyositis. ",0

A ruminal metagenomic library was constructed and functionally screened for cellulase activities and 61 independent clones expressing cellulase activities were isolated. Subcloning and sequencing of 13 positive clones expressing endoglucanase and MUCase activities identified 14 cellulase genes. Two clones carried two gene clusters that may be involved in the degradation of polysaccharide nutrients. Thirteen recombinant cellulases were partially characterized. They showed diverse optimal pH from 4 to 7. Seven cellulases were most active under acidic conditions with optimal pH of 5.5 or lower. Furthermore, one novel cellulase gene, C67-1, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant enzyme showed optimal activity at pH 4.5 and stability in a broad pH range from pH 3.5 to 10.5. Its enzyme activity was stimulated by dl-dithiothreitol. The cellulases cloned in this work may play important roles in the degradation of celluloses in the variable and low pH environment in buffalo rumen. This study provided evidence for the diversity and function of cellulases in the rumen. The cloned cellulases may at one point of time offer potential industrial applications. ",0
1894,16506499,Pediatric congenital atlantoaxial dislocation: differences between the irreducible and reducible varieties,"Clinicoradiological differences and outcome following surgery in pediatric patients (< or = 16 years of age) with congenital irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD) and reducible atlantoaxial dislocation (RAAD) were analyzed. Ninety-six patients (57 with IAAD and 39 with RAAD) were categorized as follows: Grade I, no deficits except hyperreflexia or neck pain (six patients); Grade II, minor deficits but independent for activities of daily living (25); Grade III, partially dependent (30); and Grade IV, totally dependent (35). Patients with RAAD underwent direct posterior fusion, and those with IAAD were treated with transoral decompression and posterior fusion. Patients with good outcomes included those who could walk unaided, with improvement in spasticity and weakness, and those who maintained Grade I status. The category of poor outcome included patients with the following conditions: postoperative deterioration or lack of improvement; inability to ambulate regardless of neurological improvement at a minimum follow-up duration of 3 months; or perioperative death. A significantly higher incidence of C-1 assimilation, C2-3 fusion, asymmetrical occiput-C2 facet joints, and basilar invagination were seen in patients with IAAD, and os odontoideum was noted in those with RAAD (p < 0.05). A good outcome was recorded in 35 patients with IAAD and 22 with RAAD, whereas 14 with IAAD and nine with RAAD had a poor outcome (eight patients in each category were lost to follow up). Radiological differences in the anatomy of patients with IAAD and those with RAAD may be due to improper segmentation of the occipital and upper cervical sclerotomes in the former and dysfunction of the transverse ligament in the latter. A significantly better outcome was noted in completely dependent patients with IAAD compared with those with RAAD. Respiratory compromise was an important prognostic factor. ",0
1895,2968261,Clinical and endocrine effects of cyproterone acetate in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer,"A phase II study with cyproterone acetate (CPA) was done as the primary treatment in female breast cancer patients. Twenty-three patients, mean age 64 years, range 52-75 years, were entered and treated with CPA 400 mg daily. Twenty patients were evaluable and responses were sparse. There was one partial and one complete remission, 17 patients were stable and one patient progressed within 3 months. Side-effects were frequent: five patients complained of nausea, three had severe weight loss, one suffered from depression and seven showed disturbed liver function tests. Six patients had to stop treatment for side-effects, while two other patients were taken off treatment because they developed an acute necrotizing hepatitis. The hepatitis recovered after drug withdrawal in both patients. The serum levels of CPA, cortisol, androstenedione, DHAS, LH, FSH and prolactin were measured during CPA treatment. The levels of cortisol and androstenedione did not change, while LH, FSH and DHAS were suppressed. The DHAS showed an inverse relation to serum CPA concentrations. The prolactin levels rose uniformly. The therapeutic effect of CPA in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer is disappointing, and inferior to that of other progestins. Side-effects are frequent, possibly as a result of the high dosage used in this study. The hormonal changes are different from those of other progestins, which may explain the different efficacies.",1
1896,29893796,Clinical utility of exhaled carbon monoxide in assessing preoperative smoking status and risks of postoperative morbidity after esophagectomy,"Whereas smoking constitutes a significant risk factor for postesophagectomy morbidity, there is no reliable method to assess the smoking status of patients prior to the procedure. Since exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) is an indicator of recent smoking, this paper hypothesizes that this is a useful parameter in assessing current smoking status and may help predict morbidity following esophagectomy. Sixty-nine patients, who had undergone elective three-incision esophagectomy with two- or three-field lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer, were prospectively studied between February 2015 and September 2017. At surgical admission, they were asked about their smoking history, their exhaled CO levels were evaluated, and they were grouped into three based on their CO levels. These were 0 parts per million (ppm), >0 and <7 ppm, and ≥7 ppm. Their postoperative morbidity was also assessed. Approximately 13.5% of the patients showed high levels of exhaled CO ≥ 7 ppm, despite preoperatively reporting smoking cessation for over a month. Morbidities of the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDc) ≥ II increased as exhaled CO levels increased and severe morbidity of CDc ≥ IIIb frequently was observed in patients with exhaled CO levels ≥7 ppm. The logistic regression analysis showed that exhaled CO level ≥7 ppm was an independent risk factor for severe postesophagectomy morbidity. Overall, the results of this study suggest that exhaled CO levels may be useful in estimating current smoking status and that it may also help give an estimation of the risk of postesophagectomy morbidity.

1897,28088395,Lactate and Lactate: Pyruvate Ratio in the Diagnosis and Outcomes of Pediatric Acute Liver Failure,"To assess the accuracy of blood lactate and lactate: pyruvate molar ratio (L:P) as a screen for mitochondrial, respiratory chain, or fatty acid oxidation disorders in children with pediatric acute liver failure (PALF); to determine whether serum lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L or L:P  ≥ 25 correlated with biochemical variables of clinical severity; and to determine whether lactate or L:P is associated with clinical outcome at 21 days. Retrospective review of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data for PALF study group participants who had lactate and pyruvate levels collected on the same day. Of 986 participants, 110 had lactate and pyruvate levels collected on the same day. Of the 110, the etiology of PALF was a mitochondrial disorder in 8 (7%), indeterminate in 65 (59%), and an alternative diagnosis in 37 (34%). Lactate, pyruvate, and L:P were similar among the 3 etiologic groups. There was no significant association between the initial lactate or L:P and biochemical variables of clinical severity or clinical outcome at 21 days. A serum lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L and/or elevated L:P was common in all causes of PALF, not limited to those with a mitochondrial etiology, and did not predict 21-day clinical outcome.

1898,22571348,Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) reduces the effect of oxaliplatin in colorectal liver metastases,"""AIMS: Oxaliplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent used to reduce hepatic colorectal metastases, resulting in tumour reduction and permitting surgical resection. This treatment has significant side effects, as oxaliplatin can induce sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in the non-tumour-bearing liver, resulting in increased morbidity. We hypothesized that SOS might impede hepatic perfusion, thereby interfering with the tumour environment and attenuate the response to the chemotherapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the prospective database of the Maastricht University Medical Centre we collected 50 patients with hepatic colorectal carcinoma metastases. All patients received neo-adjuvant oxaliplatin followed by partial hepatectomy. Metastases and non-tumour-bearing liver were studied histopathologically. Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients showed SOS lesions, classified as mild (26%) and moderate-severe (38%). The response to treatment, as expressed in the tumour regression grade (TRG), was grade 1 (10%); grade 2 (14%); grade 3 (28%); grade 4 (32%) and grade 5 (16%). Statistical analysis showed that a higher grade of SOS was associated with a higher grade of TRG (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Developing SOS is associated with a lower tumour response to neo-adjuvant oxaliplatin treatment. Hepatic hypoperfusion due to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome might induce hepatic hypoxia, diminishing the response to chemotherapy.""",1
1899,11986412,Participation in research and access to experimental treatments by HIV-infected patients,"BACKGROUND: Although there is concern that minority groups and women are underrepresented in research involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the available data are inconclusive. METHODS: We used nationally representative data from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study to determine the characteristics of the participants and nonparticipants in trials of medications for HIV infection and whether or not patients had access to experimental treatments. A probability sample of 2864 persons, representing all 231,400 adults with known HIV infection who are cared for in the contiguous United States, were interviewed on three occasions between 1996 and 1998. They were asked about participation in clinical research studies of medications and past receipt of experimental medications for HIV. RESULTS: We estimate that 14 percent of adults receiving care for HIV infection participated in a medication trial or study; 24 percent had received experimental medications; and 8 percent had tried and failed to obtain experimental treatments. According to multivariate models, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be participating in trials than non-Hispanic whites (odds ratio for participation among non-Hispanic blacks, 0.50 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.91]; odds ratio among Hispanics, 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.93]) and to have received experimental medications (odds ratios, 0.41 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54] and 0.56 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.78], respectively). Patients who were cared for in private health maintenance organizations were less likely to participate in trials than those with fee-for-service insurance (odds ratio, 0.43 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.88]). Women were not underrepresented in research trials and had a similar likelihood of receiving experimental treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HIV infection, participation in research trials and access to experimental treatment is influenced by race or ethnic group and type of health insurance.",0
1900,6479876,Factors influencing cholesterol nucleation in bile,"Dilution induces structural alterations (i.e., vesicle formation) in the lipid particles of supersaturated human hepatic bile and in dilute model bile systems of comparable composition. These alterations strikingly increase both the degree and duration of metastable supersaturation. Concentrated normal human gallbladder bile also shows an increased but less striking degree and duration of metastability compared to comparable model biles. These differences, particularly with respect to gallbladder bile, cannot be attributed solely to compositional or lipid structural differences between native and model systems. They imply that additional factors are responsible for metastability. Furthermore, recent data suggest that biliary proteins may be involved. A limited number of these unidentified proteins have been shown to have the capacity to prolong metastability in supersaturated in vitro model systems. Thus, these recombined systems more nearly resemble the behavior of native bile. The mechanism of the nucleation inhibitory effect of these proteins is not clearly established.",0
1901,3154674,The pharmacology of nisoldipine,"Nisoldipine is a calcium antagonist that specifically blocks the slow or voltage-dependent calcium channel up to the highest concentrations. This mode of action has been confirmed in pharmacological studies on isolated organs, electrophysiological and binding studies, and by the measurement of transmembrane calcium transport. As with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, an interaction with intracellular calcium reservoirs and calmodulin seems to be of minor importance. The drug exhibits higher potency, longer duration of action, and a higher binding affinity in vitro and in vivo than nifedipine. In contrast to its vasodilating and spasmolytic activity, its negative inotropic effect occurs in vitro only after higher concentrations than after nifedipine. In whole animals a secondary positive inotropic effect occurs regularly owing to sympathetic counter-regulation. The influence of nisoldipine on cardiac stimulus formation and conduction is also very slight in anesthetized animals, and is completely eliminated in awake animals and humans by counter-regulation up to very high doses. The cardiac anti-ischemic action of nisoldipine has been demonstrated in various ischemia models and is probably based predominantly on its afterload-reducing properties in addition to its spasmolytic effect on the coronary arteries. Various other suspected effects, for which there are isolated indications, e.g., inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, preload reduction, interaction with the transport of adenosine, and normalization of the sarcolemmal Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, are probably of subordinate importance. Its antihypertensive effect is explained primarily by lowering of the peripheral resistance. There are, however, some indications that nisoldipine exerts certain effects over and above pure vasodilation. The prevention of postischemic calcium overloading in the renal tubule epithelium and the natriuretic effect are probably of importance in the therapeutic action. Clinically, nisoldipine was found more potent and prolonged in its action in comparison with nifedipine. In comparative studies, nisoldipine, 10 mg once a day, was found equieffective with nifedipine 10 mg three times or 20 mg twice a day in angina or hypertension, respectively.",1
1902,3084160,Use of nucleic acid probes for the detection of sexually transmitted infectious agents,"Deoxyribonucleic acid sequences specific for a pathogen of interest can be isolated from a variety of microorganisms. Such DNA probes can be exploited to detect infectious agents directly in infected patient material despite the presence of large numbers of other organisms and host DNA. This technology is dependent upon the recognition of a specific nucleotide sequence present in DNA extracted from a clinical sample by a radiolabeled or nonisotopically labeled DNA probe. We have isolated several DNA probes for the detection of pathogenic Neisseria which include a plasmid species unique to the gonococcus, as well as several cloned genes that detect both the gonococcus and the meningococcus. In addition, we characterized a unique plasmid of Chlamydia trachomatis that has proved to be quite useful as a DNA probe for the detection of this pathogen in cervical secretions and, by in situ hybridization, in Papanicolaou smears. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization as a diagnostic tool is still in its infancy. It holds a number of advantages over conventional methods of pathogen detection and serves as an alternative, as well as a complement, to available immunologic methods. ",0
1903,3805669,Cimetidine hepatitis,"A 62-year-old man developed asymptomatic anicteric hepatitis during cimetidine therapy for duodenal ulcer disease. Liver biopsy revealed zonal (centrolobular) necrosis, bile stasis, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Electron microscopy featured mitochondrial hyperplasia, giant mitochondria, and liver cell bile inclusions. The diagnosis of cimetidine-related hepatitis was confirmed by re-exposure to cimetidine, which prompted a rapid rise in serum transaminases while under observation in the hospital. Cimetidine hepatitis is rarely reported, and routine monitoring of the patient's liver tests during therapy does not seem cost-effective as a general practice.",1
1904,2668763,The effect of weight loss on the sensitivity of blood pressure to sodium in obese adolescents,"To clarify the role of sodium intake in the regulation of blood pressure in obese subjects, we measured blood pressure in 60 obese and 18 nonobese adolescents after successive two-week periods of a high-salt diet (greater than 250 mmol of sodium per day) and a low-salt diet (less than 30 mmol per day). When they were changed from a high-salt to a low-salt diet, the obese group had a significantly larger mean change (+/- SE) in mean arterial pressure (-12 +/- 1 mm Hg) than did the nonobese group (+1 +/- 2 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). The variables that best predicted the degree of sodium sensitivity were the fasting plasma insulin level, the plasma aldosterone level while the low-salt diet was being given, the plasma norepinephrine level while the high-salt diet was being given, and the percentage of body weight made up by fat. Fifty-one of the obese adolescents were also studied before and after a 20-week weight-loss program. After the weight-loss program, the 36 subjects who lost more than 1 kg of body weight had a reduced sensitivity of blood pressure to sodium (difference from value during high-salt diet to that during low-salt diet, -1 +/- 1 mm Hg). The blood pressure of the remaining 15 adolescents was still sensitive to sodium intake (-11 +/- 3 mm Hg). These results support the hypothesis that the blood pressure of obese adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake and that this sensitivity may be due to the combined effects of the hyperinsulinemia, hyperaldosteronism, and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system that are characteristic of obesity.",0
1905,16772759,Nationwide efficacy-safety study of nebivolol in mildly hypertensive patients,"""Nebivolol has been adequately tested in clinical efficacy trials of patients with mild hypertension. Clinical efficacy trials or their meta-analyses did not accurately predict the outcome of subsequent large studies. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy/safety of nebivolol 5-10 mg daily in a nationwide study of patients with mild hypertension. Secondary objectives were (1) to compare efficacy/safety as monotherapy versus add-on therapy and (2) to assess the effect of nebivolol on ISH. This was an open-label, 6-week follow-up study of 6,356 patients with mild hypertension or ISH, as defined by the 1999 World Health Organization guidelines, recruited from 2,700 facilities. Previous monotherapies were continued except for beta-blockers. Results are reported as means+/-SDs. Intention-to-treat analysis is given. A total of 5,740 patients completed the study; of the withdrawals, 90% were lost for follow-up or were noncompliant, 38% were untreated before, 23% had beta-blockers. In the accumulated data, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell by 24+/-14 and 13+/-9 mm Hg (both P<0.001). The differences between the blood pressure-reducing effects of nebivolol monotherapy and add-on therapy were not statistically significant: 28+/-16 and 22+/-14 mm Hg for systolic and 15+/-11 and 11+/-8 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressures. Adverse events were limited to 0.5% of the patients, no serious adverse events were observed. In the ISH patients, diastolic blood pressure fell by 4+/-6 mm Hg compared with 15+/-10 mm Hg in the no-ISH patients (P<0.01). Efficacy-safety effects of nebivolol in patients with mild hypertension can be generalized in a nationwide assessment. The efficacy of nebivolol as monotherapy and as the efficacy as add-on therapy are very similar. Nebivolol is highly efficacious in patients with ISH.""",1
1906,25581654,Social cognition deficits and associations with drinking history in alcoholic men and women,"Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of a social cognition factor as an element of general cognition in healthy control and clinical populations. Recently developed measures of social cognition include the social perception and faces subtests of the Wechsler Advanced Clinical Solutions (ACS) Social Cognition module. While these measures have been validated on various clinical samples, they have not been studied in alcoholics. Alcoholism has been associated with emotional abnormalities and diminished social cognitive functioning as well as neuropathology of brain areas underlying social processing abilities. We used the ACS Social Perception and Faces subtests to assess alcoholism-related impairments in social cognition. Social cognitive functioning was assessed in 77 abstinent alcoholic individuals (37 women) and 59 nonalcoholic control participants (29 women), using measures of the ACS Social Cognition module and subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) that contain a social cognition component (Picture Completion and Comprehension). Group and gender differences in ACS and WAIS-IV performance were assessed, as well as relationships between measures of alcoholism severity and social cognitive functioning. Alcoholics performed significantly worse than nonalcoholics on the ACS measures of Affect Naming and Faces Content. Alcoholic men were impaired relative to alcoholic women on Prosody Face Matching and Faces Content scores. Among alcoholics, longer durations of heavy drinking were associated with poorer performance on Affect Naming, and a greater number of daily drinks were associated with lower Prosody Face Matching performance. For alcoholic women, a longer duration of abstinence was associated with better performance on Affect Naming. Alcoholic men and women showed different patterns of associations between alcoholism indices and clinically validated social cognition assessments. These findings extend into the social cognition domain, previous literature demonstrating the presence of cognitive deficits in alcoholism, their association with alcoholism severity, and variability by gender. Moreover, because impairments in social cognition can persist despite extended abstinence, they have important implications for relapse prevention. ",0
1907,20118145,Golimumab: a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data of golimumab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) monoclonal antibody. DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE (1950-September 2009) was performed to identify any published clinical trials or review articles pertaining to golimumab. Key search terms included golimumab, rheumatoid arthritis, CNTO 148, and anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors. Bibliographies of selected articles were reviewed to identify other relevant citations. Abstracts from national and international meetings and information from the manufacturer were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available published articles and abstracts describing golimumab's pharmacologic or pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and safety were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Golimumab is a fully humanized TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that is specific for human TNF-alpha. Trials have investigated the use of golimumab in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are on methotrexate, are methotrexate-na?ve, and have previously tried TNF-alpha inhibition therapy. When used in combination with methotrexate or another disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, golimumab therapy results in improvements of clinical outcomes including the American College of Rheumatology parameters in all of the aforementioned populations. Although multiple doses and dosing regimens have been studied, the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose is 50 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. The most common adverse effects include injection site erythema, headaches, and nausea. There were a limited number of incidences of serious infection or malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: With 4 TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies currently on the market, it is unclear what golimumab's place in therapy for RA will be. Some benefits include monthly injections, proven efficacy after previous TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy, and limited antibody development during therapy. However, with a lack of longer-term trials assessing efficacy and safety compared with other TNF-alpha inhibitors, golimumab should be reserved for use after other therapies fail.",1
1908,16765457,Antiviral drugs for cytomegalovirus diseases,"""Cytomegalovirus infections are associated with severe morbidity and mortality is patients at risk for disease because of immune system disabilities; in particular, recipients of stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ (SOT) transplants. There are three systemic drugs approved for CMV treatment: ganciclovir, or its prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. An anti-sense therapeutic, ISIS 2922, is also approved specifically as in intravitreal treatment for CMV retinitis. Ganciclovir, and more recently, valganciclovir, have been useful in proactive approaches of CMV disease management; in both prophylactic and preemptive regimens in HSCT and SOT populations. The major anti-herpes agent valacyclovir has also been approved for prophylaxis of renal transplant recipients, or SOTs outside of the US. These drugs have provided major advances in CMV disease management, although they are limited by intolerable toxicities, oral bioavailability and efficacy, and risk of drug resistance with extended use. Several drugs are in early clinical development which may address these limitations; this review will provide an overview of our current arsenal of available drugs, and of those in the early clinical development pipeline.""",1
1909,19581231,Exploring perceptions of cancer care delivery among older Mexican American adults,"To investigate older Mexican Americans' perceptions of cancer care delivery, specifically regarding perceived discrimination. Qualitative. Senior centers and participants' homes. 5 older Mexican American cancer survivors. The sample included five Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans with low incomes who were previously diagnosed with cancer. Ages ranged from 68-86 years (X = 76.4). Participants were recruited through several community-based agencies and resources. Interviews were conducted and recorded on audiotape in participants' homes or at a senior center. A demographic questionnaire and the Mini Mental State Exam were administered in English or Spanish. Perceptions of healthcare delivery. Three themes emerged from the interview data: (a) emotional responses to cancer diagnosis, (b) relationship with healthcare providers, and (c) use of spiritual resources in coping with cancer. Participants denied experiencing any discrimination in health care related to race, ethnicity, income, or language spoken. Perceptions of good and poor-quality health care are described. Participants were satisfied with the cancer care they received, with a few exceptions. The role of age and education level in perceived discrimination needs further exploration. Replication of this study with larger, culturally diverse samples is needed to increase understanding of the role of perceived discrimination in cancer care and to develop culturally responsive, evidence-based healthcare interventions for patients and families coping with cancer.

1910,6320760,Benign hepatocellular tumors in the young. A clinicopathologic spectrum,"""Hepatic tumors unassociated with cirrhosis were encountered in seven patients aged 10 to 19 years. Four patients had received androgens for aplastic anemia. Two patients had transfusional hemosiderosis. One patient had had a renal transplant 2 1/2 years ago. Two patients are alive at 2 3/4 and 2 1/2 years after surgical resections. Nodules were found at autopsy in the others. The tumors were well differentiated and, in the androgen-related cases, differed from the others in the following features: canalicular bile retention, mild nuclear atypia, and acinar formation. No mitoses, vascular invasion, or metastatic tumor were evident. The clinical setting was variable; different factors, including iron overload and androgen therapy, played a role in the development of tumor. Although the androgen-related cases showed mild cellular atypia, biologic evidence of malignancy was lacking as in most previous reports.""",1
1911,25912374,Liver Injury in Psoriasis Patients Receiving Ustekinumab: A Retrospective Study of 44 Patients Treated in the Clinical Practice Setting,"""INTRODUCTION: The therapy of patients with psoriasis and liver disease can be a challenge due to the increased risk of adverse effects from traditional systemic treatments; in addition, although the anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are considered safer, they have also been associated with drug-induced liver injury and reactivation of viral hepatitis. Ustekinumab has a different mechanism of action and the little that is known of its effects on the liver comes from pivotal studies. The objectives of this study were to estimate the incidence of drug-induced liver injury in patients treated with ustekinumab in daily clinical practice and to analyze liver alterations in those patients with pre-existing liver disease. METHOD: All patients treated with the standard regimen of ustekinumab were included in the study. Variables gathered included age, sex, type of psoriasis, nail involvement, arthritis, previous treatments, history of liver disease, viral serology, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (at baseline and at 12, 16, and 52 weeks), transaminase levels, manifestations of liver disease, liver ultrasound, and factors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, and ferritin levels. RESULTS: Grade 1 elevation of the transaminases was only observed in 6 patients; no cases of severe hypertransaminasemia were observed. None of the patients with elevation of the transaminases at baseline developed problems during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab-related liver injury is uncommon and mild. From a hepatic point of view, the drug appears safe, even in patients with pre-existing liver disease and those who have developed altered liver function previously with other drugs.""",1
1912,8929264,The DCC protein and prognosis in colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated, the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) gene is a candidate. We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age, sex, tumor site, degree of tumor differentiation, and use of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas. In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC, the five-year survival rate was 94.3 percent, whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors, the survival rate was 61.6 percent (P<0.001). In patients with stage III disease, the respective survival rates were 59.3 percent and 33.2 percent (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer. In stage II colorectal carcinomas, the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers. These findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients.",0
1913,10366730,The affinity and kinetics of inhibition of cysteine proteinases by intact recombinant bovine cystatin C,"Recent studies have shown that the bovine cysteine proteinase inhibitor, cystatin C, is synthesized as a preprotein containing a 118-residue mature protein. However, the forms of the inhibitor isolated previously from bovine tissues had shorter N-terminal regions than expected from these results, and also lower affinity for proteinases than human cystatin C. In this work, we report the properties of recombinant, full-length bovine cystatin C having a complete N-terminal region. The general characteristics of this form of the inhibitor, as reflected by the isoelectric point, the far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum, the thermal stability and the changes of tryptophan fluorescence on interaction with papain, resembled those of human cystatin C. The affinity and kinetics of inhibition of papain and cathepsins B, H and L by the bovine inhibitor were also comparable with those of the human inhibitor, although certain differences were apparent. Notably, the affinity of bovine cystatin C for cathepsin H was somewhat weaker than that of human cystatin C, and bovine cystatin C bound to cathepsin L with about a four-fold higher association rate constant than the human inhibitor. This rate constant is comparable with the highest values reported previously for cystatin-cysteine proteinase reactions. The full-length, recombinant bovine cystatin C bound appreciably more tightly to proteinases than the shorter form characterized previously. Digestion of the recombinant inhibitor with neutrophil elastase resulted in forms with truncated N-terminal regions and appreciably decreased affinity for papain, consistent with the forms of bovine cystatin C isolated previously having arisen by proteolytic cleavage of a mature, full-length inhibitor.

1914,18948848,Beneficial effects of ethyl pyruvate in a mouse model of spinal cord injury,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) the effect of the treatment with ethyl pyruvate (EP). Spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy in mice. Treatment with EP (75, 25, or 8.5 mg/kg) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly decreased (a) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (b) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), (c) nitrotyrosine formation and iNOS expression, (d) proinflammatory cytokines expression, (e) nuclear factor kappaB activation, (f) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and (g) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, Fas ligand, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, EP (75, 25, or 8.5 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner the loss of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). Taken together, our results demonstrate that EP treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma. ",0
1915,6355851,Does free care improve adults' health? Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Does free medical care lead to better health than insurance plans that require the patient to shoulder part of the cost? In an effort to answer this question, we studied 3958 people between the ages of 14 and 61 who were free of disability that precluded work and had been randomly assigned to a set of insurance plans for three or five years. One plan provided free care; the others required enrollees to pay a share of their medical bills. As previously reported, patients in the latter group made approximately one-third fewer visits to a physician and were hospitalized about one-third less often. For persons with poor vision and for low-income persons with high blood pressure, free care brought an improvement (vision better by 0.2 Snellen lines, diastolic blood pressure lower by 3 mm Hg); better control of blood pressure reduced the calculated risk of early death among those at high risk. For the average participant, as well as for subgroups differing in income and initial health status, no significant effects were detected on eight other measures of health status and health habits. Confidence intervals for these eight measures were sufficiently narrow to rule out all but a minimal influence, favorable or adverse, of free care for the average participant. For some measures of health in subgroups of the population, however, the broader confidence intervals make this conclusion less certain.",0

Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 1020A was a phase I/II open label study of ATV (with/without ritonavir [RTV] boosting)-based treatment of HIV-infected children; here we report the long-term safety and virologic and immunologic responses. METHODS: Antiretroviral-na?ve and experienced children, ages 91 days to 21 years, with baseline plasma HIV RNA > 5000 copies/mL (cpm) were enrolled at sites in the United States and South Africa. RESULTS: Of 195 children enrolled, 142 (73%) subjects received ATV-based regimens at the final protocol recommended dose; 58% were treatment naive. Overall, at week 24, 84/139 subjects (60.4%) and at week 48, 83/142 (58.5%) had HIV RNA ? 400 cpm. At week 48, 69.5% of na?ve and 43.3% of experienced subjects had HIV RNA ? 400 cpm; median CD4 increase was 196.5 cells/mm. The primary adverse event (AE) was increased serum bilirubin; 9% of subjects had levels ? 5.1 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1.4% noted jaundice. Three percent of subjects experienced grade 2 or 3 prolongation in PR or QTc intervals. At week 48, there was a 15% increase in total cholesterol (TC), with TC > 199 mg/dL increasing from 1% at baseline to 5.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Use of once-daily ATV, with/without RTV, was safe and well tolerated in children, with acceptable levels of viral suppression and CD4 count increase. The primary AE, as expected, was an increase in bilirubin levels.""",1

1918,10373016,"Facial development and type III collagen RNA expression: concurrent repression in the osteopetrotic (Toothless,tl) rat and rescue after treatment with colony-stimulating factor-1","The toothless (osteopetrotic) mutation in the rat is characterized by retarded development of the anterior facial skeleton. Growth of the anterior face in rats occurs at the premaxillary-maxillary suture (PMMS). To identify potential mechanisms for stunted facial growth in this mutation we compared the temporospatial expression of collagen I (Col I) and collagen III (Col III) RNA around this suture in toothless (tl) rats and normal littermates by in situ hybridization of specific riboprobes in sagittal sections of the head. In normal rats, the suture is S shaped at birth and becomes highly convoluted by 10 days with cells in the center (fibroblasts and osteoblast progenitors) expressing Col III RNA and those at the periphery (osteoblasts) expressing no Col III RNA but high amounts of Col I RNA throughout the growth phase (the first 2 postnatal weeks). In the mutant PMMS, cells were reduced in number, less differentiated, and fewer osteoblasts were encountered. Expression of Col I RNA was at normal levels, but centrosutural cells expressed Col III RNA only after day 6 and then only weakly. A highly convoluted sutural shape was never achieved in mutants during the first 2 postnatal weeks. Treatment of tl rats with the cytokine CSF-1 improved facial growth and restored cellular diversity and Col III RNA expression in the PMMS to normal levels. Taken together, these data suggest that normal facial growth in rats is related to expression of Col III RNAby osteoblast precursors in the PMMS, that these cells are deficient in the tl mutation and are rescued following treatment with CSF-1.

1919,27464489,Interim analysis of post-marketing surveillance of eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in Japan,"Data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are limited. We describe the safety and effectiveness of eculizumab in PNH patients enrolled in a post-marketing surveillance study. Types and frequencies of observed adverse events were similar to those reported in previous clinical trials and no meningococcal infection was reported. Effectiveness outcomes included the reduction of intravascular hemolysis, the change in hemoglobin (Hb) level, the withdrawal of transfusion and corticosteroids, the change of renal function, and overall survival. The effect of eculizumab on intravascular hemolysis was demonstrated by a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase levels at all measurements after baseline. Significant increases in Hb levels from baseline were also observed after 1�month's treatment with eculizumab (p�<�0.01). Of those who were transfusion-dependent at baseline, the median number of transfusions decreased significantly from 18 to 0 unit/year after 1�year of treatment with eculizumab (p�<�0.001). An increase in Hb and a high rate of transfusion independence were observed, especially in patients with platelet count ?150�?�10(9)/L. Approximately 97�% of patients showed maintenance or improvement of renal function. Overall survival rate was about 90�% (median follow-up 1.9�years). These results suggest an acceptable safety profile and favorable prognosis after eculizumab intervention.",1
1920,10388518,Conjugated linoleic acid inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of normal rat mammary epithelial cells in primary culture,"The trace fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) inhibits rat mammary carcinogenesis when fed prior to carcinogen during pubertal mammary gland development or during the promotion phase of carcinogenesis. The following studies were done to investigate possible mechanisms of these effects. Using a physiological model for growth and differentiation of normal rat mammary epithelial cell organoids (MEO) in primary culture, we found that CLA, but not linoleic acid (LA), inhibited growth of MEO and that this growth inhibition was mediated both by a reduction in DNA synthesis and a stimulation of apoptosis. The effects of CLA did not appear to be mediated by changes in epithelial protein kinase C (PKC) since neither total activity nor expression nor localization of PKC isoenzymes alpha, beta II, delta, epsilon, eta, or zeta were altered in the epithelium of CLA-fed rats. In contrast, PKCs delta, epsilon, and eta were specifically upregulated and associated with a lipid-like, but acetone-insoluble, fibrillar material found exclusively in adipocytes from CLA-fed rats. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that CLA can act directly to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of normal MEO and may thus prevent breast cancer by its ability to reduce mammary epithelial density and to inhibit the outgrowth of initiated MEO. Moreover, the changes in mammary adipocyte PKC expression and lipid composition suggest that the adipose stroma may play an important in vivo role in mediating the ability of CLA to inhibit mammary carcinogenesis.

1921,10075273,Efficacy and safety of combination therapy with delavirdine and zidovudine: a European/Australian phase II trial,"The objective of the study was to investigate the safety and antiviral effect of three delavirdine dose regimens or placebo in combination with zidovudine in patients who were already taking zidovudine. Eighty-nine symptomatic HIV-1 seropositive individuals with CD4 cell counts between 50 and 350 cells/microl were included in this trial The influence of combination therapy on viral susceptibility to both zidovudine and delavirdine was investigated. Death or the occurrence, or re-occurrence of an AIDS-defining illness was considered as a clinical endpoint. The addition of delavirdine to the antiretroviral treatment regimen resulted in a significant, but transient, reduction in virus load, as determined by quantitative RNA measurements. CD4+ cell count did not change significantly. Susceptibility to zidovudine remained unchanged after 12 weeks of combination therapy, while 70% of the patients demonstrated a substantial decrease (> 10-fold) in sensitivity to delavirdine. Two patients suffered from an AIDS-defining disease during the study. No deaths occurred. Generally, the drug appeared to be safe. Skin rash was the most frequently observed adverse event (52%). In most patients the rash either resolved spontaneously or was treated successfully with a short course of antihistamines. The definite place of the compound in the management of HIV disease, in particular when given in combination with other antiretroviral agents, remains to be further explored.",1
1922,25412696,p62 Deficiency Enhances α-Synuclein Pathology in Mice,"In Lewy body disease (LBD) such as dementia with LBs and Parkinson's disease, several lines of evidence show that disrupted proteolysis occurs. p62/SQSTM1 (p62) is highly involved with intracellular proteolysis and is a component of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in various neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is not clear whether p62 deficiency affects inclusion formation and abnormal protein accumulation. To answer this question, we used a mouse model of LBD that lacks p62, and found that LB-like inclusions were observed in transgenic mice that overexpressed α-synuclein (Tg mice) with or without the p62 protein. p62 deficiency enhanced α-synuclein pathology with regard to the number of inclusions and staining intensity compared with Tg mice that expressed p62. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the loss of p62 in Tg mice, we assessed the mRNA and protein levels of several molecules, and found that the neighbor of the brca1 gene (NBr1), which is functionally and structurally similar to p62, is increased in Tg mice without p62 compared with control Tg mice. These findings suggest that p62 and NBR1 affect the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases through the cooperative modulation of α-synuclein aggregation.  ",0

1924,25386935,T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to drugs,"The immunological mechanisms driving delayed hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to drugs mediated by drug-reactive T lymphocytes are exemplified by several key examples and their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations: abacavir and HLA-B*57:01, carbamazepine and HLA-B*15:02, allo-purinol and HLA-B*58:01, and both amoxicillin-clavulanate and nevirapine with multiple class I and II alleles. For HLA-restricted drug HSRs, specific class I and/or II HLA alleles are necessary but not sufficient for tissue specificity and the clinical syndrome. Several models have been proposed to explain the immunopathogenesis of severe T cell-mediated drug HSRs, and our increased understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms involved in the development of these reactions will further the development of sensitive and specific strategies for preclinical screening that will lead to safer and more cost-effective drug design.",1

Blood pressure and ECG were recorded before, during and after 5 min. perfusion of increasing doses of epinephrine (1, 5, 10 and 25 micrograms.kg-1.min.-1). Ventricular arrhythmia was evaluated from the ECG using a modified Lown's grading system. The ventricular hypertrophy index was calculated from the heart/body weight ratio (mg/g). The mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in groups H1 and H2 than in the control group. The ventricular hypertrophy was significant in group H2, but not in group H1. There was no significant difference between the amplitudes of the epinephrine-induced hypertensive responses in the 3 groups but the extent of arrhythmia was significantly lower in the animals with high hypertrophy index.

1926,24074637,"Benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of early-phase Alzheimer disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission is vital for learning and memory. Hypofunction of NMDAR has been reported to play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), particularly in the early phase. Enhancing NMDAR activation might be a novel treatment approach. One of the methods to enhance NMDAR activity is to raise the levels of NMDA coagonists by blocking their metabolism. This study examined the efficacy and safety of sodium benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in four major medical centers in Taiwan. Sixty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild AD were treated with 250-750 mg/day of sodium benzoate or placebo for 24 weeks. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (the primary outcome) and global function (assessed by Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input) were measured every 8 weeks. Additional cognition composite was measured at baseline and endpoint. Sodium benzoate produced a better improvement than placebo in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (p = .0021, .0116, and .0031 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively), additional cognition composite (p = .007 at endpoint) and Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (p = .015, .016, and .012 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively). Sodium benzoate was well-tolerated without evident side-effects. Sodium benzoate substantially improved cognitive and overall functions in patients with early-phase AD. The preliminary results show promise for D-amino acid oxidase inhibition as a novel approach for early dementing processes. ",0
1927,15754377,Budesonide combined with UDCA to improve liver histology in primary biliary cirrhosis: a three-year randomized trial,"Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a safe medical therapy for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), but its effect on liver histology remains uncertain. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with high receptor activity and high first-pass metabolism in liver. We evaluated the combination of budesonide and UDCA on liver histology and compared this with UDCA alone in a 3-year prospective, randomized, open multicenter study. Patients with PBC (n = 77), at stages I to III, were randomized into 2 treatment arms, A (n = 41): budesonide 6 mg/d and UDCA 15 mg/kg/d and B (n = 36): UDCA 15 mg/kg/d. Liver histology was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Liver function tests and glucose and cortisol values were determined every 4 months. Paired liver biopsy specimens were available from 69 patients (A = 37 and B = 32). Stage improved 22% in group A but deteriorated 20% in group B (P = .009). Fibrosis decreased 25% in group A but increased 70% in group B (P = .0009). S-PIIINP decreased significantly in group A. Inflammation decreased in both groups, 34% in group A (P = .02), but only 10% in group B (P = NS). Serum liver enzymes decreased significantly in both treatment arms. Bilirubin values rose in group B but stayed stable in group A (A/B P = .002). A mild systemic glucocorticoid effect from budesonide was evident after 2 years. In conclusion, budesonide combined with UDCA improved liver histology, whereas the effect of UDCA alone was mainly on laboratory values. Studies with longer follow-up using a combination of budesonide and UDCA are warranted to confirm safety and effects.",1
1928,15872200,Screening for the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer),"BACKGROUND: Germ-line mutations in the mismatch-repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 lead to the development of the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), conferring a strong susceptibility to cancer. We assessed the frequency of such mutations in patients with colorectal cancer and examined strategies for molecular screening to identify patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma at the major hospitals in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio, were eligible for the study. Genotyping of the tumor for microsatellite instability was the primary screening method. Among patients whose screening results were positive for microsatellite instability, we searched for germ-line mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 genes with the use of immunohistochemical staining for mismatch-repair proteins, genomic sequencing, and deletion studies. Family members of carriers of the mutations were counseled, and those found to be at risk were offered mutation testing. RESULTS: Of 1066 patients enrolled in the study, 208 (19.5 percent) had microsatellite instability, and 23 of these patients had a mutation causing the Lynch syndrome (2.2 percent). Among the 23 probands with the Lynch syndrome, 10 were more than 50 years of age and 5 did not meet the Amsterdam criteria or the Bethesda guidelines for the diagnosis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (including the use of age and family history to identify patients at high risk for the Lynch syndrome). Genotyping for microsatellite instability alone and immunohistochemical analysis alone each failed to identify two probands. In the families of 21 of the probands, 117 persons at risk were tested, and of these, 52 had Lynch syndrome mutations and 65 did not. CONCLUSIONS: Routine molecular screening of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma for the Lynch syndrome identified mutations in patients and their family members that otherwise would not have been detected. These data suggest that the effectiveness of screening with immunohistochemical analysis of the mismatch-repair proteins would be similar to that of the more complex strategy of genotyping for microsatellite instability.",0

1931,23627639,Thickness of superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) predicts imiquimod efficacy: a proposal for a thickness-based definition of sBCC,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy in the white population. It is an important driver of healthcare costs and causes significant morbidity. Topical imiquimod is a good noninvasive treatment alternative for surgical excision in superficial BCC (sBCC). However, there are currently no uniform histological definitions of sBCC. A definition based on tumour thickness might be a good alternative. To determine whether tumour thickness in sBCC is a predictor of treatment failure. We retrospectively examined 127 histological biopsy specimens of sBCC treated primarily with imiquimod five times a week for 6 weeks. Mean follow-up was 34 months (range 3-91). Recurrence was evaluated clinically with histological verification. Among nonrecurrent cases the median tumour thickness was 0·26 mm (range 0·09-0·61), while for recurrent cases the median tumour thickness was 0·57 mm (range 0·41-1·41, P < 0·0001). Among lesions ≤ 0·40 mm in thickness, none recurred, whereas for lesions > 0·40 mm the recurrence rate was 58% (P < 0·0001). We recommend the use of tumour thickness to define the superficial pattern in pathology reports for BCC as this can help to determine treatment response of sBCC to imiquimod. ",0

1933,16899775,High-dose atorvastatin after stroke or transient ischemic attack,"""BACKGROUND: Statins reduce the incidence of strokes among patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; whether they reduce the risk of stroke after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains to be established. METHODS: We randomly assigned 4731 patients who had had a stroke or TIA within one to six months before study entry, had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg per deciliter (2.6 to 4.9 mmol per liter), and had no known coronary heart disease to double-blind treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo. The primary end point was a first nonfatal or fatal stroke. RESULTS: The mean LDL cholesterol level during the trial was 73 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) among patients receiving atorvastatin and 129 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) among patients receiving placebo. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 265 patients (11.2 percent) receiving atorvastatin and 311 patients (13.1 percent) receiving placebo had a fatal or nonfatal stroke (5-year absolute reduction in risk, 2.2 percent; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P=0.03; unadjusted P=0.05). The atorvastatin group had 218 ischemic strokes and 55 hemorrhagic strokes, whereas the placebo group had 274 ischemic strokes and 33 hemorrhagic strokes. The five-year absolute reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was 3.5 percent (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002). The overall mortality rate was similar, with 216 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 211 deaths in the placebo group (P=0.98), as were the rates of serious adverse events. Elevated liver enzyme values were more common in patients taking atorvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, 80 mg of atorvastatin per day reduced the overall incidence of strokes and of cardiovascular events, despite a small increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.

Relative to control females, steroid treatment depressed gonadotropin secretion and increased both dry body weight and fat content but without an increase in food intake. Steroid treatment depressed spontaneous use of a running wheel and open-field activity, and it increased aggressiveness. It also eliminated a behavior related to encounters between the sexes--the rejection of genital inspection. There was no effect of steroid treatment on the time required to recover from 10 h of enforced running on a treadmill. Overall, regardless of the test or measure, there was little or no difference in the effect of the high and low dose of steroids. This indicates a threshold of response below the low dose used in these studies, which itself is probably well below that used by many female athletes and body builders. ",0

A survey of identified cells of the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia was undertaken to determine the extent of bag cell influence in the ganglion. Bursts of bag cell spike activity lasting 5--40 min were elicited by brief, 0.6- to 2 s local stimulation while recording simultaneously from bag cells and other ganglion cells with intracellular electrodes. 2. Slow inhibition occurs in giant cell R2, neurosecretory cells R3-R14, and ink-gland motoneurons, L14A, B, C. The cells remain hyperpolarized for from 15 to 60 min. 3. Transient excitation occurs in mechanoreceptor cells L1 and R1. The cells are strongly depolarized by a slow excitatory potential that lasts for about 10 min and produces spike activity for 3--7 min. 4. Prolonged excitation occurs in some cells of the LB and LC identified cell clusters. The cells are depolarized and spike activity is increased for 3 h or more. 5. A biphasic response occasionally occurs in the command interneuron L10. Inhibition of this cell lasts 10--15 min and is followed by excitation for several hours. Excitation is accompanied by facilitation of synaptic potentials for 40--60 min in cells innervated by L10; the facilitation apparently results from the increase in L10 firing rate. 6. The results indicate that the bag cells have multiple types of actions and affect large numbers of ganglion neurons. All effects have the slowly graded onsets and prolonged durations to be expected of hormonally mediated interactions. 7. Previous studies have indicated that in intact animals the bag cell burst discharge initates a stereotyped egg-laying behavioral pattern that persists for several hours (3, 27). The present data support the hypothesis that certain elements of egg-laying behavior and homeostasis are regulated by a direct action of the bag cells on the central nervous system. ",0
1938,14871278,Monitoring methotrexate-induced hepatic fibrosis in patients with psoriasis: are serial liver biopsies justified?,"BACKGROUND: Reports that up to 26% of subjects with psoriasis develop cirrhosis have led to a recommendation of serial liver biopsies after each cumulative dose of 1500 mg of methotrexate. AIM: To evaluate the progression of liver injury in patients with psoriasis and the impact of monitoring by liver biopsy on their management. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one liver biopsies from 66 subjects (aged 11-79 years) with psoriasis, receiving a median cumulative dose of 3206 mg of methotrexate over a period of 280.5 weeks, were evaluated. RESULTS: The assessment of advanced fibrosis according to the Ishak system (>or= 4) correlated perfectly with that of the Scheuer system (>or= 3) and poorly with that of the Roenigk scale (>or= 3b) (r2 = 1.0 and 0.31, respectively). Two of 24 pre-treatment biopsies showed advanced fibrosis and both subjects were heavy drinkers. The cumulative probabilities of advanced fibrosis (Ishak >or= 4) were 0%, 2.6%, 2.6%, 8.2% and 8.2% at cumulative doses of 1500, 3000, 4500, 5000 and 6000 mg, respectively. None of the subjects developed cirrhosis during follow-up or discontinued therapy on the basis of liver biopsy findings. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced hepatic fibrosis with low-dose methotrexate therapy is much less frequent than previously reported.

Close relationships are considered the fundamental building block of person-centred care. Prior studies have examined the various types of relationships residents develop with peers and staff, but few have focused specifically on articulating the characteristics and dimensions of a close relationship or the factors that can support or detract from their development. Grounded theory. Fifteen cognitively intact residents from two nursing homes were recruited for one-on-one, unstructured interviews. Interview questions started broadly and became more focused as the study progressed. Data were analysed using open, axial and selective coding. Residents described developing a range of relationships with peers and staff (adversarial, utilitarian, and friendly). Residents used """"friendly"""" to describe many different types of relationships including acquaintanceships, casual friendships and close friendships. Few residents had close relationships with peers or staff. Several conditions promoted development of positive and friendly relationships. Physical proximity and access to peers with similar interests, who could communicate clearly, fostered friendly peer relationships. Spending noncare time, providing little extras, treating residents as special and responding positively to care requests fostered friendly staff relationships. Findings add new evidence regarding nuances in resident relationships and demonstrate how development of close relationships may be limited in practice. Careful assessment of resident relationship needs and goals may be critical to setting appropriate social goals. Nurses can be intentional about resident placements in the facility to promote social interactions and keep social goals in mind when making medical or staffing decisions to prevent interruption of important relationships.

1941,9462659,Compatible organic osmolytes in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells,"Compatible organic osmolytes, such as betaine and taurine are involved in the regulation of Kupffer cell (KC) function, but nothing is known about osmolytes in liver endothelial cells. This was investigated here by studying the effect of aniso-osmotic exposure of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) on osmolyte transport and the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the transport systems for betaine (BGT1), taurine (TAUT), and myo-inositol (SMIT). Compared with normo-osmotic exposure (305 mosmol/L), hyperosmotic exposure (405 mosmol/L) of SEC led to an increase in the mRNA levels for these transport systems and simultaneously to a stimulation of betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol uptake, which led to an increase of cell volume. Conversely, hypo-osmotic exposure decreased osmolyte uptake. When hyperosmotically pre-exposed SEC were loaded with betaine, taurine, or myoinositol, hypo-osmotic stress stimulated the efflux of these osmolytes from the cells. Studies on osmolyte tissue levels revealed that taurine was an important compatible organic osmolyte under normo-osmotic conditions and predominantly released following hypo-osmotic stress. Conversely, following hyperosmotic exposure, the increase in cellular betaine and myo-inositol exceeded that of taurine. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated SEC, hyperosmotic exposure markedly raised the mRNA levels for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The increase of COX-2 mRNA levels was counteracted by betaine and taurine and, to a lesser extent, by myo-inositol. The findings indicate that SEC use taurine, betaine, and myo-inositol as compatible organic osmolytes.",0
1942,25422474,Substrate recognition by the cell surface palmitoyl transferase DHHC5,"The cardiac phosphoprotein phospholemman (PLM) regulates the cardiac sodium pump, activating the pump when phosphorylated and inhibiting it when palmitoylated. Protein palmitoylation, the reversible attachment of a 16 carbon fatty acid to a cysteine thiol, is catalyzed by the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases. The cell surface palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5 regulates a growing number of cellular processes, but relatively few DHHC5 substrates have been identified to date. We examined the expression of DHHC isoforms in ventricular muscle and report that DHHC5 is among the most abundantly expressed DHHCs in the heart and localizes to caveolin-enriched cell surface microdomains. DHHC5 coimmunoprecipitates with PLM in ventricular myocytes and transiently transfected cells. Overexpression and silencing experiments indicate that DHHC5 palmitoylates PLM at two juxtamembrane cysteines, C40 and C42, although C40 is the principal palmitoylation site. PLM interaction with and palmitoylation by DHHC5 is independent of the DHHC5 PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) binding motif, but requires a ∼ 120 amino acid region of the DHHC5 intracellular C-tail immediately after the fourth transmembrane domain. PLM C42A but not PLM C40A inhibits the Na pump, indicating PLM palmitoylation at C40 but not C42 is required for PLM-mediated inhibition of pump activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate an enzyme-substrate relationship for DHHC5 and PLM and describe a means of substrate recruitment not hitherto described for this acyltransferase. We propose that PLM palmitoylation by DHHC5 promotes phospholipid interactions that inhibit the Na pump. ",0
1943,17978884,Transcriptional analysis of a major capsid protein gene from Spodoptera exigua ascovirus 5a,"The major capsid protein (mcp) gene of Spodoptera exigua ascovirus 5a (SeAV-5a) was confirmed by aphidicolin viral DNA replication inhibition analysis to be a late gene. The 5' and 3' ends of mcp gene transcripts have been mapped. Primer extension analyses indicated that transcription of the mcp gene initiates from a cytosine 25 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the translation start codon. Two independent approaches by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) and oligo (dT) cellulose binding assay suggested that SeAV-5a mcp mRNA is polyadenylated. Analyses by 3' RACE also revealed that mcp transcripts terminate at a U, either at 26 or 38 nt downstream of the translation stop codon. The putative 5' transcription control region of the SeAV-5a mcp gene shares similarities with other ascoviruses and Chilo iridescent virus (CIV), containing a conserved TATA-box-like motif (TAATTAAA) and an ATTTGATCTT motif upstream of it. The 3' downstream regions of the mcp gene of all the ascoviruses examined and CIV can form a stem-loop structure, and the ends of the mcp gene transcripts of SeAV-5a are within the predicted stem-loop region. This suggests that the stem-loop structure of the mcp gene might be involved in transcription termination. ",0

1947,7852133,Oral pilocarpine for radiation-induced xerostomia: integrated efficacy and safety results from two prospective randomized clinical trials,"""PURPOSE: Pilocarpine hydrochloride administered in either a fixed-dose or in a dose-titration protocol three times a day for 12 weeks was evaluated for its ability to relieve symptoms of postradiation xerostomia and to improve saliva production. The studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials. A total of 369 patients who had received at least 40 Gy of radiation to the head and neck with clinically significant xerostomia were enrolled in the two studies. In the dose-titration study, 162 patients were enrolled and they received a thrice daily regimen of 2.5 mg tablets for first 4 weeks, 5.0 mg tablets for the second 4 weeks, and 10.0 mg tablets for last 4 weeks of a 12-week study. Patients in the titration study were allowed to down titrate following at least one dose escalation to alleviate bothersome side effects, if any. In the fixed dose study, 207 patients received either placebo, 5.0 mg, or 10.0 mg tablets t.i.d. for 12 weeks. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were evaluated for symptomatic relief by responding to questionnaires using visual analog scales and categorical questions; and, for saliva production by sialometry. Questionnaires measured relief of intraoral dryness, improvement in overall condition (global response), oral discomfort, difficulty in speaking, chewing and swallowing, denture wearing, and usage of artificial saliva. Evaluations were conducted at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: There were statistically significant improvements in salivary flow in pilocarpine treatment groups vs. placebo. There was a significant improvement in the overall """"global"""" condition of xerostomia associated with the use of pilocarpine in both studies. In the fixed-dose study, there were significant improvements in oral dryness, mouth comfort, ability to speak, and reduction in the use of oral comfort agents. The dose-titration study showed improvements in dryness that approached significance (p = 0.057) and a decreased use of oral comfort agents (p = 0.045). All pilocarpine dosages (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg three times a day) were judged to be safe. Adverse experiences were those expected for a cholinergic agonist, with the most common being mild to moderate sweating. The incidence of these events increased by dose. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that in these studies pilocarpine produced clinically significant benefits with acceptable side effects and risks for the treatment of symptomatic postradiation xerostomia. The incidence of most adverse events increased with dose. Best results may require continuous treatment for more than 8 weeks with doses greater than 2.5 mg three times a day. A 5.0 mg thrice daily regimen produced the best clinical results when both efficacy and side effects were taken into consideration. There may be some patients who would experience some additional benefit by increasing the dose to 10 mg thrice daily.""",1
1948,20502130,Effectiveness of switching from aripiprazole to ziprasidone in patients with schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVES: Aripiprazole and ziprasidone are 2 antipsychotic medications that are relatively devoid of the metabolic adverse effects associated with the second-generation antipsychotics. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of switching to ziprasidone in patients who had insufficient response or intolerance to aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia. METHODS: Nineteen patients receiving aripiprazole treatment for schizophrenia participated in this open-label 12-week study. Outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Beck Depression Inventory, and Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics Scale. Safety measures included metabolic parameters and scales to evaluate extrapyramidal adverse effects. RESULTS: After switching to ziprasidone from aripiprazole, significant improvement of scores on the negative symptom subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and the Beck Depression Inventory were observed at the study end point evaluation. Metabolic parameters including body weight, waist and hip circumferences, fasting blood glucose, and alanine aminotransferase showed statistically significant decreases. However, serum prolactin levels were significantly increased, and sedation was the most common adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to ziprasidone in patients with schizophrenia who showed insufficient response or intolerance to aripiprazole improved depression, negative symptoms, and metabolic disturbances. However, sedation and hyperprolactinemia were commonly associated with the switch to ziprasidone.",1

1951,8320810,[A case of suspected liver dysfunction induced by sevoflurane anesthesia],"We report a case of suspected liver dysfunction after general anesthesia with sevoflurane. A 30 day old male infant underwent inguinal herniorrhaphy under sevoflurane anesthesia (sevoflurane concentration: 1.3-1.5% with 50% oxygen and nitrous oxide). Two days after the operation, he developed frequent vomiting, anorexia and fever. GOT, GPT and LDH values were 242 Ku, 326 Ku and 901 Wu, respectively and peaked at 520 Ku, 709 Ku and 1000 Wu 12-16 days after the operation. Clinical symptoms and the laboratory data became normal within 2 months. The antibody titers of EB-virus, cytomegalo-virus and HA-virus were all within normal ranges and HBs antigen was negative. There were no blood transfusion or antibiotics administration before the onset, and no epidemic of hepatitis around him. His mother had no history of hepatitis during her pregnancy. Lymphocyte stimulation test for indication of sevoflurane allergy was also negative. From these evidences, toxic (not allergic) liver dysfunction due to exposure to sevoflurane was considered to be the most probable diagnosis.",1
1952,22554152,Hepatic hemodynamics in 24 patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and symptomatic portal hypertension,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate hepatic hemodynamics in patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver (NRH) with portal hypertension (PHT). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 24 patients referred for PHT related to biopsy-proven NRH. Hemodynamic measurements included wedged hepatic vein (WHVP) and inferior vena cava (IVCP), and, in 12 patients, portal vein pressure (PVP). Hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG: WHVP-IVCP) and portal vein pressure gradient (PVPG: PVP-IVCP) were calculated. RESULTS: Nodular regenerative hyperplasia was associated in 24 patients with various diseases (oxaliplatin chemotherapy, treatment with purine antagonists, post liver transplantation, hematologic and rheumatologic conditions and HIV infection). Liver function parameters were either completely normal or slightly impaired. Patients were referred for gastroesophageal varices (n = 18), and/or ascites (n = 11), and/or splenomegaly (n = 20). In patients with varices or ascites, HVPG was lower than 10 mmHg (a cut-off point for the presence of varices and/or ascites) in 15/21, suggesting a pre-sinusoidal component to their PHT confirmed by a PVP higher than 12 mmHg in 12/12 patients. The mean difference between HVPG and PVPG was 8.7 mmHg in these patients. Ten patients were treated by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. None of them re-bled, and one presented transient hepatic encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Presinusoidal PHT associated with NRH is probably related to compression of portal venules by the regenerative nodules. In patients with HTP and a HVPG < 10 mmHg, the diagnosis of NRH must be suspected and PVP measured, which is important in the management of these patients.",1

The DNA-activated type I IFN pathway cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is linked to subsets of AGS and lupus. This study was undertaken to identify inhibitors of the DNA-cGAS interaction, and to test the lead candidate drug, X6, in a mouse model of AGS. Trex1 On the basis of the efficacy-to-toxicity ratio established in vitro, drug X6 was selected as the lead candidate for treatment of Trex1 This study demonstrates that X6 is superior to HCQ for the treatment of an experimental autoimmune myocarditis mediated in vivo by the cGAS/stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS/STING) pathway. The findings suggest that drug X6 could be developed as a novel treatment for AGS and/or lupus to inhibit activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. ",0
1954,15037196,Usnic acid-induced necrosis of cultured mouse hepatocytes: inhibition of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress,"""Usnic acid, a lichen acid, is a compound found in crude medicines and dietary supplements, including Lipokinetix, a supplement marketed as a weight loss agent that caused hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure in patients. In this study, we examined the toxicity of usnic acid and assessed whether usnic acid may be contributing to hepatotoxicity caused by Lipokinetix. In primary cultured murine hepatocytes, usnic acid treatment (5 microM) resulted in 98% necrosis within 16 hr (no apoptosis was detected). Usnic acid treatment was associated with early inhibition and uncoupling of the electron transport chain in mitochondria of cultured hepatocytes. This inhibition of mitochondria by usnic acid corresponded with a fall in ATP levels in hepatocytes. In isolated liver mitochondria, usnic acid was observed to directly inhibit and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative stress appears to be central in usnic acid-induced hepatotoxicity based on the following findings: (1) pretreatment with antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene+Vitamin E) decreased usnic acid-induced necrosis by nearly 70%; (2) depletion of mitochondrial GSH with diethylmaleate increased susceptibility of hepatocytes to usnic acid; (3) usnic acid treatment was associated with increase free radical generation, measured using the fluorescent probe, dichlorodihydrofluorescin. The source of reactive oxygen species after usnic acid treatment include autoxidation of usnic acid and increased hydrogen peroxide generation by mitochondria caused by usnic acid inhibition of the respiratory chain, with the latter playing a more prominent role. Taken together, our results suggest that usnic acid is a strong hepatotoxic agent that triggers oxidative stress and disrupts the normal metabolic processes of cells. Usnic acid therefore may contribute to the hepatotoxic effects of Lipokinetix and its use in any supplement must come into question.""",1

Unfortunately, approximately one third of these individuals will experience an adverse drug reaction at some time. Cutaneous manifestations are most commonly recognized and do not necessarily preclude reinstitution of gold after their resolution. Other complications involving the hematopoietic and renal systems are less frequent but may be severe. Recently, investigators have described serious toxic reactions involving the liver and lungs. The pathophysiologic mechanism of these untoward effects appears to be immunologic, although there are conflicting data. Treatment is primarily supportive, and the role of corticosteroids and chelating agents remains controversial. Emphasis should be placed primarily on early detection of adverse reactions through patient education and careful monitoring of blood and urine values.",1

Review of the literature shows that adenoma of the liver is an uncommon tumor in man since only 30 other cases have been reported. The tumor is often multiple (55 p. 100) and the clinical manifestations are quite different from those observed in women: the adenoma is often asymptomatic (45 p. 100) and rupture is rare (10 p. 100). Androgens seem to be implicated in the development of adenoma in man since 8 out of 31 patients had received androgens for a long period of time; androgens also seem to favor the tumor's rupture.""",1
1957,24988613,The role of hepcidin in iron metabolism in inflammatory bowel diseases],"Hepcidin is a 25-amino-acid peptide synthesized predominantly in hepatocytes, which plays an essential role in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. As a result of inflammation, hepcidin binds to ferroportin resulting in its internalization and degradation in enterocytes and macrophages. Thus iron is trapped in both enterocytes and macrophages, leading to functional hypoferremia. In iron deficiency or enhanced erythropoiesis, hepcidin expression is reduced. That fact results in increase of iron absorption and releasing iron storage from macrophages. The discovery of the biological properties of hepcidin clarified the relationship between iron homeostasis, immune response, and anaemia of chronic disease. Anaemia is the most common extra intestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. Anaemia significantly reduces the quality-of-life among patients and can lead to a number of serious complications, even life-threatening. The main types of anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases are iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease. These two types of anaemia coexist commonly. The key issue is differentiation these types of anaemia to implement a proper management. Commonly used parameters as iron concentration, ferritin and transferrin, are rather unreliable indices for the evaluation of anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases. In recent studies the important role of hepcidin as a potential alternative marker of anemia and iron status has been shown. Moreover, there are data that antihepcidin treatment may be an effective treatment of anaemia of chronic disease in inflammatory bowel disease. This paper presents hepcidin structure, mechanism of action and regulation, and highlights hepcidin function in anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease. ",0
1958,25006361,Bacteria and bacterial DNA in atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysmal wall biopsies from patients with and without periodontitis,"Several studies have reported an association between chronic periodontitis (CP) and cardiovascular diseases. Detection of periodontopathogens, including red complex bacteria (RCB), in vascular lesions has suggested these bacteria to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. In this study, we investigate bacteria and their DNA in vascular biopsies from patients with vascular diseases (VD; i.e. abdominal aortic aneurysms, atherosclerotic carotid, and common femoral arteries), with and without CP. DNA was extracted from vascular biopsies selected from 40 VD patients: 30 with CP and 10 without CP. The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA (V3-V5) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli, sequenced, and classified (GenBank and the Human Oral Microbiome database). Species-specific primers were used for the detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, 10 randomly selected vascular biopsies from the CP group were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for visualization of bacteria. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was performed to assess the presence of RCB in 10 randomly selected subgingival plaque samples from CP patients. A higher load and mean diversity of bacteria were detected in vascular biopsies from VD patients with CP compared to those without CP. Enterobacteriaceae were frequently detected in vascular biopsies together with cultivable, commensal oral, and not-yet-cultured bacterial species. While 70% of the subgingival plaque samples from CP patients showed presence of RCB, only P. gingivalis was detected in one vascular biopsy. Bacterial cells were seen in all 10 vascular biopsies examined by SEM. A higher bacterial load and more diverse colonization were detected in VD lesions of CP patients as compared to patients without CP. This indicated that a multitude of bacterial species both from the gut and the oral cavity, rather than exclusively periodontopathogens, may be involved as additional risk factors in the pathogenesis of VD.

Our aim was to compare the risk of recurrent parasitaemia in patients given artemether-lumefantrine with that in those given amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for uncomplicated malaria. METHODS: We enrolled 521 patients aged 6 months or older with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of either artemether-lumefantrine (261) or amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (260) for 3 days. Primary endpoints were the risks of treatment failure within 28 days, either unadjusted or adjusted by genotyping to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. The study is registered at controlled-trials.gov with the identifier ISRCTN54261005. FINDINGS: Of enrolled patients, 478 (92%) completed the 28-day study. The risk of recurrent symptomatic malaria was lowest in the group given amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1.7%vs 10.2%; risk difference 8.5%; 95% CI 4.3-12.6; p=0.0001); as was the risk of recurrent parasitaemia (4.7%vs 15.1%; 10.4%; 5.1-15.6; p=0.0002). Nearly all recurrences were due to new infections. Recrudescences were four late treatment failures with artemether-lumefantrine and one early treatment failure with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Both regimens were safe and well tolerated, with pruritus more common with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine than with artemether-lumefantrine. Each regimen selected for new isolates with mutations that have been associated with decreased drug susceptibility. INTERPRETATION: Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was more effective than was artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. For regions of Africa where amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine continues to be effective, this less expensive and more available regimen should be considered as an alternative to blanket recommendations for artemisinin-based combination treatment for malaria.""",1

1963,19085953,Functional linkage of cirrhosis-predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms of Toll-like receptor 4 to hepatic stellate cell responses,"In a recent study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene (c.1196C>T [rs4986791, p.T399I]) emerged as conferring protection from fibrosis progression compared to a major, wild-type (WT) CC allele (p.T399). The present study examined the functional linkage of this SNP, along with another common, highly cosegregated TLR4 SNP (c.896A>G [rs4986790, p.D299G]), to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) responses. Both HSCs from TLR4(-/-) mice and a human HSC line (LX-2) reconstituted with either TLR4 D299G and/or T399I complementary DNAs were hyporesponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation compared to those expressing WT TLR4, as assessed by the expression and secretion of LPS-induced inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines (i.e., monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6), down-regulation of bone morphogenic protein and the activin membrane-bound inhibitor expression (an inhibitory transforming growth factor beta pseudoreceptor), and activation of a nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-responsive luciferase reporter. In addition, spontaneous apoptosis, as well as apoptosis induced by pathway inhibitors of NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were greatly increased in HSCs from either TLR4(-/-) or myeloid differentiation factor 88(-/-) (a TLR adaptor protein) mice, as well as in murine HSCs expressing D299G and/or T399I SNPs; increased apoptosis in these lines was accompanied by decreased phospho-ERK and Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: TLR4 D299G and T399I SNPs that are associated with protection from hepatic fibrosis reduce TLR4-mediated inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling and lower the apoptotic threshold of activated HSCs. These findings provide a mechanistic link that explains how specific TLR4 SNPs may regulate the risk of fibrosis progression.",0

1967,24917558,Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein promotes activation of hepatic stellate cells by regulating Rab11-dependent plasma membrane targeting of transforming growth factor beta receptors,"Liver microenvironment is a critical determinant for development and progression of liver metastasis. Under transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) stimulation, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are liver-specific pericytes, transdifferentiate into tumor-associated myofibroblasts that promote tumor implantation (TI) and growth in the liver. However, the regulation of this HSC activation process remains poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) of HSCs regulated the TGF-?-mediated HSC activation process and tumor growth. In both an experimental liver metastasis mouse model and cancer patients, colorectal cancer cells reaching liver sinusoids induced up-regulation of VASP and alpha-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) in adjacent HSCs. VASP knockdown in HSCs inhibited TGF-?-mediated myofibroblastic activation of HSCs, TI, and growth in mice. Mechanistically, VASP formed protein complexes with TGF-? receptor II (T?RII) and Rab11, a Ras-like small GTPase and key regulator of recycling endosomes. VASP knockdown impaired Rab11 activity and Rab11-dependent targeting of T?RII to the plasma membrane, thereby desensitizing HSCs to TGF-?1 stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a requirement of VASP for TGF-?-mediated HSC activation in the tumor microenvironment by regulating Rab11-dependent recycling of T?RII to the plasma membrane. VASP and its effector, Rab11, in the tumor microenvironment thus present therapeutic targets for reducing TI and metastatic growth in the liver.",0
1968,8076926,Papaverine inhibits bile acid excretion in isolated perfused rat liver,"We investigated the effects of papaverine on bile acid excretion into bile in the presence of infusions of taurocholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurodehydrocholic acid in a single-pass, isolated perfused rat liver model. Although continuous infusion of papaverine (1.6 mumol/min) did not reduce bile acid excretion in the presence of low-dose (1.0 mumol/min) infusions of taurocholic acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid, papaverine significantly inhibited biliary excretion of bile acids in the presence of low-dose taurochenodeoxycholic acid (-50%) and high-dose (3.0 mumol/min) taurocholic acid (-54%), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (-37%) and taurodehydrocholic acid (-31%). During continuous infusion of taurocholic acid (3 mumol/min), a 15-min infusion of papaverine (3.2 mumol/min) reduced bile acid excretion significantly; however, total uptake of bile acid was slightly decreased by the papaverine infusion. Bile acid excretion increased over the baseline value after the papaverine infusion was stopped and then returned to baseline. These results suggest that papaverine does not affect the uptake phase of bile acids at the sinusoidal membrane but may affect the intracellular transport phase or the excretory phase at the bile canalicular membrane. When taurocholic acid was infused at a constant rate of 3 mumol/min for 20 min without papaverine and then stopped, bile acid excretion decreased gradually and was nearly zero by 52 min. Cumulative bile acid excretion in the 52 min after the end of the infusion reached 3.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/gm liver and represented the storage capacity of the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
1969,17505501,Genome-wide pharmacogenetic investigation of a hepatic adverse event without clinical signs of immunopathology suggests an underlying immune pathogenesis,"One of the major goals of pharmacogenetics is to elucidate mechanisms and identify patients at increased risk of adverse events (AEs). To date, however, there have been only a few successful examples of this type of approach. In this paper, we describe a retrospective case-control pharmacogenetic study of an AE of unknown mechanism, characterized by elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during long-term treatment with the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. The study was based on 74 cases and 130 treated controls and included both a genome-wide tag single nucleotide polymorphism and large-scale candidate gene analysis. A strong genetic association between elevated ALAT and the MHC alleles DRB1(*)07 and DQA1(*)02 was discovered and replicated, suggesting a possible immune pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunological studies suggest that ximelagatran may have the ability to act as a contact sensitizer, and hence be able to stimulate an adaptive immune response.",1
1970,2233961,Long-term outcome after surgical repair of isolated atrial septal defect. Follow-up at 27 to 32 years,"BACKGROUND: Atrial septal defects have been surgically correctable for more than 30 years. The long-term survival rates among patients treated in the early era of cardiac surgery are poorly documented, but such data are of critical importance to the future medical care, employability, and insurability of these patients. METHODS: To determine the natural history of surgically corrected atrial septal defects, we studied all 123 patients who underwent repair of an isolated defect (ostium secundum or sinus venosus) at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960, 27 to 32 years after the procedure. The follow-up status of all patients was determined by written questionnaires and telephone interviews. Hospital records and death certificates were obtained if interim hospitalization or death had occurred. RESULTS: The overall 30-year actuarial survival rate among survivors of the perioperative period was 74 percent, as compared with 85 percent among controls matched for age and sex. The perioperative mortality was 3.3 percent (four deaths). Actuarial 27-year survival rates among patients in the younger two quartiles according to age at operation (less than or equal to 11 years and 12 to 24 years) were no different from rates among controls--97 percent and 93 percent, respectively. In the two older quartiles (25 to 41 years and greater than 41 years), 27-year survival rates were significantly less (P less than 0.001)--84 percent and 40 percent, respectively--than in controls (91 and 59 percent). Independent predictors of long-term survival according to multivariate analysis were age at operation (P less than 0.0001) and systolic pressure in the main pulmonary artery before operation (P less than 0.0027). When repair was performed in older patients, late cardiac failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were significantly more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with surgically repaired atrial septal defects, those operated on before the age of 25 have an excellent prognosis, but older patients require careful, regular supervision.",0

A hemodynamic study was performed in a group of rats with long-standing portal hypertension induced by portal vein constriction performed 6.2 +/- 0.1 months earlier. A group of rats matched by age and weight with short-term (20.7 +/- 0.9 days) portal hypertension and a group of long-term (6.2 +/- 0.1 months) sham-operated rats were used as controls. Cardiac output and regional blood flows were measured using a radioactive microsphere technique. Arterial blood levels of glucagon, a known vasodilator that was implicated in the etiology of the hyperdynamic circulation, were also measured. Portal pressure in long- and short-term portal hypertensive groups (12.3 +/- 0.4 and 13.7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; not statistically significant) was higher than in the sham group (9.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01).

1972,2537593,Transformation of hepatic cell adenoma to hepatocellular carcinoma due to oral contraceptive use,"Unlike the proven causal association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and hepatic cell adenoma, the link between OCs and hepatocellular carcinoma remains speculative. The case history of a 53-year-old US woman suggests, however, that hepatic cell adenomas may transform into hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient, who had used Ovral continuously since 1966, presented in 1985 with vague abdominal pain and a palpable right upper quadrant mass. Computed tomography revealed a 12 x 8 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe and 2 small lesions in the left lobe. Serum alpha-fetoprotein and ferritin levels were normal and tests for hepatitis B were negative. A needle biopsy of the right lobe mass indicated benign hepatic adenoma. OC use was discontinued and the patient was examined at bimonthly intervals. Although she continued to report vague pain, there were no significant changes in radiologic findings or levels of alpha-fetoprotein over the next 18 months. At the 18-month follow-up visit, the alpha-fetoprotein level showed an increase to 227 mcg/L and had risen to 2300 mcg/L by the 30-month follow-up visit. At this time, computed tomography showed slight enlargement of the right lobe mass and inhomogeneity, while biopsy revealed sclerosing hepatocellular carcinoma.

1973,24500966,The ABCs of viral hepatitis that define biomarker signatures of acute viral hepatitis,"Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver disease worldwide and can be caused by several agents, including hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), and C (HCV) virus. We employed multiplexed protein immune assays to identify biomarker signatures of viral hepatitis in order to define unique and common responses for three different acute viral infections of the liver. We performed multianalyte profiling, measuring the concentrations of 182 serum proteins obtained from acute HAV- (18), HBV- (18), and HCV-infected (28) individuals, recruited as part of a hospital-based surveillance program in Cairo, Egypt. Virus-specific biomarker signatures were identified and validation was performed using a unique patient population. A core signature of 46 plasma proteins was commonly modulated in all three infections, as compared to healthy controls. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed a host response based upon 34 proteins, which could distinguish HCV patients from HAV- and HBV-infected individuals or healthy controls. When HAV and HBV groups were compared directly, 34 differentially expressed serum proteins allowed the separation of these two patient groups. A validation study was performed on an additional 111 patients, confirming the relevance of our initial findings, and defining the 17 analytes that reproducibly segregated the patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: This combined discovery and biomarker validation approach revealed a previously unrecognized virus-specific induction of host proteins. The identification of hepatitis virus specific signatures provides a foundation for functional studies and the identification of potential correlates of viral clearance.",0
1974,15239078,Acetaminophen and the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group: lowering the risks of hepatic failure,"Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause for calls to Poison Control Centers (>100,000/year) and accounts for more than 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and an estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure each year. Data from the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry of more than 700 patients with acute liver failure across the United States implicates acetaminophen poisoning in nearly 50% of all acute liver failure in this country. Available in many single or combination products, acetaminophen produces more than 1 billion US dollars in annual sales for Tylenol products alone. It is heavily marketed for its safety compared to nonsteroidal analgesics. By enabling self-diagnosis and treatment of minor aches and pains, its benefits are said by the Food and Drug Administration to outweigh its risks. It still must be asked: Is this amount of injury and death really acceptable for an over-the-counter pain reliever?",1
1975,15049554,"Evaluation of genotoxicity of sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid using plant tests]","The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential genotoxic effects of three drinking water disinfectants by means of in vivo short-term mutagenicity tests using plants. The study was carried out in laboratory using distilled water disinfected with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and peracetic acid (PAA) at different concentrations both in neutral and acid conditions. Untreated distilled water was used as a negative control. Micronuclei test in Tradescantia pollen cells and chromosomal aberration test in root cells of Allium cepa were the bioassays performed by exposing directly plant bioindicators to treated and untreated distilled water. The Tradescantia/micronuclei test gave positive results in most of the ClO2-treated water samples but only at acid pH. The Allium cepa test showed genotoxicity in NaClO-treated samples at acid pH and in a ClO2-treated sample at pH 7. PAA-treated samples were always nongenotoxic. Since the concentrations tested of free disinfectants are usually present in drinking water for biocidal purposes, genotoxicity of these compounds could be a public health problem. ",0

We conducted a multicenter phase II study of CNTO328 (siltuximab) as second-line therapy for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible men had castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with one prior chemotherapy. Subjects were treated with 6 mg/kg CNTO328 i.v. every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. Response was assessed after every three cycles. Primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate defined as a 50% reduction. Accrual was planned in two stages, with 20 eligible patients in the first stage and 40 overall. Plasma cytokines and growth factors were measured by Luminex. RESULTS: Fifty-three eligible subjects had all received prior taxane therapy. Two (3.8%; 95% CI, 0.5-13.0%) had PSA response. None of the 31 patients with measurable disease had a RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response but 7 (23%) had stable disease. With median follow-up of 14.8 months, median progression-free survival was 1.6 months (95% CI, 1.6-1.7) and median overall survival was 11.6 months (95% CI, 7.5-19.0). Grade 3/4 toxicities included disseminated intravascular coagulation (1), central nervous system ischemia (1), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (1), gastritis/esophagitis (2), thrombocytopenia (2), pain (2), leukopenia (1), and neuropathy (2). Median baseline IL-6 levels were 12.5 pg/mL (interquartile range, 2.5-41.5). Patients with IL-6 >12.5 pg/mL had worse survival than those with levels <12.5 pg/mL (53% versus 94%; P = 0.02). After treatment, IL-6 levels were >250-fold higher. Thirty-two of 38 patients had a decline in C-reactive protein plasma levels at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: CNTO328 resulted in a PSA response rate of 3.8% and a RECIST stable disease rate of 23%. Declining C-reactive protein levels during treatment may reflect biological activity. Despite evidence of CNTO-mediated IL-6 inhibition, elevated baseline IL-6 levels portended a poor prognosis.""",1

1978,7657155,Vitamin D3 intoxication in naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) leads to hypercalcaemia and increased calcium deposition in teeth with evidence of abnormal skin calcification,"Naked mole-rats have no access to obvious sources of vitamin D and therefore have an impoverished vitamin D status. In an investigation into the effects of vitamin D supplementation, inadvertently supraphysiological doses of 130,000 times the normal dose of vitamin D were administered. Within 5 days animals appeared lethargic, with reduced food intake. All but one of the seven animals were killed and blood was collected. Plasma vitamin D metabolites 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D and calcium were determined. Both vitamin D metabolite concentrations exceeded the upper limits of sensitivity of the assays (> 100 ng/ml 25(OH)D and > 210 pg/ml 1,25(OH)2D). Active calcium uptake in the intestine was evident along with concomitant increases in calcium concentration in plasma, bone, and teeth. The remaining animal survived, but showed scab-like formations in the skin around the lower jaw and along the nipple line. X-ray analyses revealed calcium deposition in these cornified regions, although there was no evidence of metastatic calcification in other tissues. Deposition of excess calcium in skin that is regularly sloughed off and in teeth that are continuously worn down and replaced may reduce the vitamin D-induced hypercalcaemia and thus alleviate the effects of vitamin D intoxication.

1979,12058881,Tamoxifen-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen,"OBJECTIVE: The benefits of 5-year tamoxifen administration for patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer undoubtedly outweigh the risk of any adverse effects. Massive hepatic steatosis is an example of its side effects. Here we show risk factors for the development of massive hepatic steatosis and describe a representative clinical course of these patients treated with fibrates for the first time. METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) numbers of the liver and spleen were measured and correlated to body mass index (BMI) and pregnanetriol/pregnanediol ratio in urine (P3/P2 ratio). PATIENTS: We enrolled 56 premenopausal women treated with breast conservation treatment. They received oral tamoxifen (40 mg/day for 2 to 3 years) as adjuvant endocrine therapy with systemic chemotherapy. RESULTS: Serum estradiol level in 48 of 56 patients treated with tamoxifen was less than 10 pg/ml. The ratio of hepatic CT number to splenic CT number<0.9 was related to increased BMI (>23.6 kg/sqm) and reduced P/P2 ratio (<1). Fibrates are potent enough to improve hepatic steatosis in tamoxifen-induced hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: P3/P2 ratio<1 was related to sufficient blockade of estrogen receptor proven by the development of massive hepatic steatosis. Therefore, we propose that tamoxifen is not a mere antagonist of estrogen, but it may also suppress estrogen synthesis when estrogen receptor is blocked sufficiently. The undetectable level of serum estrogen in tamoxifen-treated premenopausal women may partially explain why tamoxifen was so effective in estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer.",1

1981,2445642,Antibodies against acetaldehyde-modified protein epitopes in human alcoholics,"Acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, binds covalently to proteins forming condensation products which have been recently shown to be immunogenic. To assess whether an antibody response against acetaldehyde-modified protein epitopes is associated with alcoholic liver disease, the serum immunoreactivity against proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde and against the corresponding unmodified proteins was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 58 alcoholics with varying degrees of liver damage. Alcoholics showed significantly higher titers against protein-acetaldehyde conjugates than against the unmodified protein, independent of the nature of the carrier protein. The highest titers occurred in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Sera of patients with chronic hepatitis of nonalcoholic origin and of healthy controls also reacted with acetaldehyde conjugates, but their titers were significantly lower than those in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Our data support the idea that binding of acetaldehyde to proteins in humans generates antigenic determinants which trigger a corresponding immune response against such epitopes and suggest that this humoral immune response may be implicated in autoantibody formation and liver damage associated with excessive alcohol consumption.",0
1982,17987318,Post-embryonic pericardial cells of Drosophila are required for overcoming toxic stress but not for cardiac function or adult development,"The Drosophila heart is composed of two cell types: cardioblasts (CB) and pericardial cells (PC). Whereas CBs act to maintain rhythmic contractions, the functions of accessory PCs are not clear. The close association between these two cell types has led to speculation of a cardio-regulatory role for PCs. However, we find that viability and cardiac function are normal in larvae following post-embryonic ablation of PCs by induced cell death. Removal of PCs during the larval instars or before metamorphosis results in viable and fertile adults. Interestingly, such animals have a reduced lifespan and increased sensitivity to toxic chemicals. Thus, although PCs may have an embryonic role in cardiogenesis, they do not appear to play a part later in cardiac function as suggested. However, the role of PCs in the uptake and sequestering of toxins, their sensitivity to toxic stress and the decreased lifespan of animals without PCs indicate the importance of PCs in organismal homeostasis.

1983,20014183,"A randomized, controlled, double-blind, pilot study of milk thistle for the treatment of hepatotoxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)","BACKGROUND: Despite limited preclinical and clinical investigations, milk thistle (MT) is often used for the treatment of chemotherapy-associated hepatotoxicity. Limited treatment options exist for chemotherapy-related hepatoxicity. Given the wide use of MT, the authors investigated MT in both the laboratory and a clinical setting. METHODS: In a double-blind study, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hepatic toxicity were randomized to MT or placebo orally for 28 days. Liver function tests were evaluated during the study period. To assess MT in vitro, the authors evaluated supratherapeutic concentrations in an ALL cell line. RESULTS: Fifty children were enrolled. No significant differences in frequency of side effects, incidence and severity of toxicities, or infections were observed between groups. There were no significant changes in mean amino alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), or total bilirubin (TB) at Day 28. At Day 56, the MT group had a significantly lower AST (P = .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P = .07). Although not significantly different, chemotherapy doses were reduced in 61% of the MT group compared with 72% of the placebo group. In vitro experiments revealed no antagonistic interactions between MT and vincristine or L-asparaginase in CCRF-CEM cells. A modest synergistic effect with vincristine was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In children with ALL and liver toxicity, MT was associated with a trend toward significant reductions in liver toxicity. MT did not antagonize the effects of chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of ALL. Future study is needed to determine the most effective dose and duration of MT and its effect on hepatotoxicity and leukemia-free survival.",1

By contrast, nothing is known about the role of bile ductular epithelial cells in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. The purpose of the current studies was to establish whether bile ductular epithelial cells synthesize cholesterol, bile acids or both and to determine whether these cells are capable of metabolizing (hydroxylating, conjugating) bile acids. Bile ductular epithelial cells were isolated from rat liver after ligation of the common bile duct for 6 to 8 wk. Bile ductular epithelial cells were essentially free (greater than 99%) of hepatocytes and were histochemically positive (greater than 80%) for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. Cholestatic hepatocytes were simultaneously isolated and characterized with regard to their ability to synthesize and metabolize bile acids. Incubation of bile ductular epithelial cells with [14C]-acetate resulted in rapid labeling of cellular cholesterol, suggesting that these cells have a complete cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The addition of [4-14C]-cholesterol to bile ductular epithelial cells did not lead to detectable synthesis of [14C]-bile acids. [24-14C]-Cholic acid, [24-14C]-deoxycholic acid, [24-14C]-lithocholic acid and [3H]-ursodeoxycholic acid were individually added to bile ductular epithelial cells and incubated for 24 or 48 hr. Bile acid metabolites were extracted and separated by C-18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography or thin-layer chromatography. Bile ductular epithelial cells conjugated deoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid to glycine and taurine. Surprisingly, no conjugation of cholic acid was detected. Conjugated lithocholic acid was further metabolized to highly polar metabolite(s), possibly beta-muricholic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

There is currently no simple recommendation for the assessment of population-level zinc deficiency. Trials of zinc supplementation have shown positive effects of supplementation on clinical outcomes and growth. We reviewed the results of randomized trials of zinc supplementation and correlation studies that assessed infectious diseases, growth, and development outcomes among children under 5 years of age. The results indicate that zinc supplementation decreases the incidence and prevalence of diarrhea and pneumonia, but the use of trial data to make population-level estimates of zinc deficiency is not practical and is difficult to quantify. The data also indicate that zinc supplementation increases growth, especially among children who are stunted. Stunting rates are commonly estimated and can be used to estimate zinc deficiency. Previous recommendations suggest that stunting rates at or above 20% should be indicative of zinc deficiency among children under 5 years of age. This review provides additional data and analysis to support the current recommendation. ",0

Dalfampridine extended-release tablets have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to review the safety profile of dalfampridine extended-release tablets with respect to its expected use in patients with MS. METHODS: We reviewed published data relevant to patient safety profiles based on searches of articles in PubMed published up to December 31, 2010, using the search terms fampridine OR dalfampridine OR 4-aminopyridine AND (multiple sclerosis) in combination with toxicity, safety, clinical trial, pharmacokinetics, and seizures. These searches were supplemented with data derived from the approved package insert and relevant sections of the New Drug Application (22-250) as submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: The literature searches returned 58 unique citations, of which 26 were considered relevant for characterizing the safety profile of dalfampridine; excluded citations were as follows: reviews (19), evaluation of 3,4-diaminopyridine (4), intravenous dosing (2), inadequate information on patient doses (2), preclinical models (2), and """"other"""" (3). Dalfampridine is nearly completely (approximately 96%) eliminated unchanged in urine, with limited transformation to 2 inactive metabolites and low risk for interaction with drugs metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochromes. However, in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl], ?80 mL/min), mean peak plasma concentrations were 68%-101% higher and apparent clearance was 43%-73% lower relative to those without impairment, precluding dalfampridine use in patients with moderate (CrCl, 30-50 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (CrCl, <30 mL/min). Dalfampridine has a narrow therapeutic range. At the therapeutic dose of 10 mg twice daily, adverse events were generally mild to moderate and, consistent with the mechanism of action of dalfampridine, were primarily related to stimulatory effects on the nervous system. A thorough QT study suggested a low risk of induction of QT prolongation and associated cardiac arrhythmias in healthy individuals at therapeutic (10 mg, twice daily) or supratherapeutic (30 mg, twice daily) doses. Although the incidence of seizures was dose related, data from the clinical trials of dalfampridine extended-release tablets suggest that the risk of seizure at the therapeutic dose, in patients with no history of seizure, is not likely to be higher than background rates in MS. CONCLUSION: In patients with MS, dalfampridine has a narrow therapeutic range but an acceptable safety profile when used at the therapeutic dose of 10 mg twice daily.""",1
1995,9881719,EMS and UV-light-induced colony sectoring and delayed mutation in Chinese hamster cells,"To review studies of mutagen-induced colony sectoring which demonstrate that UV light and EMS produce delayed mutational events in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Since the late 1940s, it has been known that the treatment of a single bacterial or yeast cell with mutagenic agents produces complete mutant colonies (pures) and colonies composed of both mutant and non-mutant cell types (mosaics) with various sectored patterns. A similar sectoring phenomenon has been observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) using the DNA alkylating agent ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) or ultraviolet light. However, unlike bacteria and yeast, a significant fraction of CHO mutant colonies contained sectors of less than 1/2; i.e. 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 sectors, suggesting a delayed production of mutations. Using various colony-replating approaches, it was found that these mutagenic agents produced the ratio of mutant to wild-type cells expected for a delayed mutational process which produces mutant events for at least 12-14 cell divisions following treatment. This delayed mutation phenomenon was observed at both the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) loci. Various mutational mechanisms for the production of delayed mutations are discussed. These studies suggest that mutagens such as UV light and EMS induce long-term alterations in mammalian cells that act to increase the 'apparent' spontaneous mutation frequency. This delayed mutational decrease in stability of the genome may explain the accumulation over time of the multiple genetic changes observed in malignant tumours. ",0

Findings were little affected by age and height adjustment and were similar for sudden cardiac death. The first-second vital capacity was also inversely related to later development of these conditions, but the ratio of that measurement to total vital capacity was not. Heavy smoking, productive cough, exertional dyspnea and cardiac enlargement were associated with diminished total capacity. However, exclusion of subjects with these findings did not reduce the predictive value of total vital capacity. Diminished vital capacity deserves continued attention as a possible coronary risk factor. Its relation to subsequent coronary events is not well explained.",0
1999,24433880,Cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles on human hepatoma HepG2 cells,"Tea polyphenols have strong antioxidant and antitumor activities. However, these health benefits are limited due to their poor in vivo stability and low bioavailability. Chitosan nanoparticles as delivery systems may provide an alternative approach for enhancing bioavailability of poorly absorbed drugs. In this study, tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles have been prepared using two different chitosan biomaterials, and their antitumor effects were evaluated in HepG2 cells, including cell cytotoxicity comparison, cell morphology analysis, cell apoptosis and cell cycle detection. The results indicated that the tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed a branch shape and heterogeneous distribution in prepared suspension. MTT assay suggested that tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles could inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells, and the cytotoxicity rates were increased gradually and appeared an obvious dose-dependent relationship. Transmission electron microscope images showed that the HepG2 cells treated with tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles exhibited some typical apoptotic features, such as microvilli disappearance, margination of nuclear chromatin, intracytoplasmic vacuoles and the mitochondrial swelling. In addition, the tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles had relatively weak inhibitory effects on HepG2 cancer cells compared with tea polyphenols. Tea polyphenols not only induced cancer cell apoptosis, but also promoted their necrosis. However, tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles exhibited their antitumor effects mainly through inducing cell apoptosis. Our results revealed that the inhibition effects of tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles on tumor cells probably depended on their controlled drug release and effective cell delivery. The chitosan nanoparticles themselves as the delivery carrier showed limited antitumor effects compared with their encapsulated drugs.  ",0
2000,18339848,EphA2 is an essential mediator of UV radiation-induced apoptosis,"One of the physiologic consequences of excessive UV radiation (UVR) exposure is apoptosis. This critical response serves to eliminate genetically injured cells and arises, in part, from activation of DNA damage and p53 signaling. Other contributory pathways, however, likely exist but have not been fully characterized. In a recent global screen of UVR response genes in melanocytes, we identified the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA2. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we set out to investigate the upstream regulation of EphA2 by UVR and the functional consequences of this effect. We found that the UVR-associated increase in EphA2 occurs in melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts from both human and murine sources. More specifically, UVR effectively up-regulated EphA2 individually in p53-null, p63-null, and p73-null murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), suggesting that the p53 family of transcription factors is not essential for the observed effect. However, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by U0126 and PD98059 significantly reduced the UVR response whereas overexpression of oncogenic NRAS led to an increase in EphA2. These results confirm that UVR induces EphA2 by a p53-independent, but MAPK-dependent, mechanism. In response to UV irradiation, Epha2(-/-) MEFs were highly resistant to UVR-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis whereas introduction of EphA2 into both wild-type and p53-null MEFs led to activation of an apoptotic program that can be blocked by caspase-8 inhibition. These functional findings suggest that EphA2 is in fact an essential p53-independent, caspase-8-dependent proapoptotic factor induced by UVR. ",0

In the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that BBB endothelial cells depend considerably on the brain microenvironment to a degree exceeding the environmental influence in other organs. The concept of the BBB has been continuously developed over the decades, culminating now in the recognition that endothelial cell function in the brain is not limited to simply mediating energy and oxygen transfer between blood and neural tissue. Endothelial cells are rather """"Janus-headed beings"""" that are active partners of both luminal molecules and cells, as well as subendothelial cells such as pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons.

After a brief introduction of the BBB that describes the structure and function of the brain capillary endothelial cells, the authors report on both the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes and the extracellular matrix between astrocytes/pericytes and endothelial cells. The AQP4 has an important impact on the homeostasis in the brain parenchyma; however, the mechanistic cascade from the composition of the astrocyte membrane to the maintenance of BBB properties in the endothelial cells, including their tight junction formation, is still completely unknown.

2003,24434873,A non-intrusive method for monitoring the degradation of MOSFETs,"Highly reliable embedded systems have been widely applied in the fields of aerospace, nuclear power, high-speed rail, etc., which are related to security and economic development. The reliability of the power supply directly influences the security of the embedded system, and has been the research focus of numerous electronic information and energy studies. The degradation of power modules occupies a dominant position among the key factors affecting the power supply reliability. How to dynamically determine the degradation state and forecast the remaining useful life of working power modules is critical. Therefore, an online non-intrusive method of obtaining the degradation state of MOSFETs based on the Volterra series is proposed. It uses the self-driving signal of MOSFETs as a non-intrusive incentive, and extracts the degradation characteristics of MOSFETs by the frequency-domain kernel of the Volterra series. Experimental results show that the identification achieved by the method agrees well with the theoretical analysis.  ",0
2004,25041517,Early predictors of severe acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in a paediatric population referred to a tertiary paediatric department,"AIM: The data on severe acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in children are very limited. This study explored the dose-response relationship between ingested acetaminophen and hepatotoxicity, the early biochemical and clinical predictors of hepatotoxicity, the impact of early N-acetylcysteine treatment on hepatotoxicity and the incidence of nephrotoxicity. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective case study on 25 children aged 11-16 years with severe acetaminophen poisoning. RESULTS: Initial biochemical parameters predicted hepatotoxicity, defined as the maximum levels of the international normalised ratio (INR) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Significant relationships were found between: (1) the maximal INR and, for example, the initial bilirubin (p = 0.0003) and initial phosphate (p = 0.003), (2) the maximal ALT and, for example, the initial INR (p = 0.0003) and initial creatinine (p = 0.002), (3) the number of prehospital vomiting episodes and, for example, the maximal INR (p = 0.013) and maximum ALT (p = 0.0005) and (4) the time of N-acetylcysteine initiation and, for example, maximum ALT (p = 0.001) and maximum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (p = 0.007). The incidence of nephrotoxicity was 12%. There was no significant relationship between the amount of ingested acetaminophen and the degree of hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients at increased risk of severe hepatotoxicity were identified by early biochemical parameters, prehospital vomiting episodes and latency time before N-acetylcysteine initiation.",1

2006,16038474,Are adverse events of nevirapine and efavirenz related to plasma concentrations?,"OBJECTIVE: The relationships between adverse events (AEs) and plasma concentrations of nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) were investigated as part of the large, international, randomized 2NN study. METHODS: Treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected patients received NVP (once or twice daily), EFV or their combination, each in combination with lamivudine and stavudine. Blood samples were collected on day 3 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48. Concentrations of NVP and EFV were quantitatively assessed by a validated HPLC assay. Individual Bayesian estimates of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC24h), and minimum and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmin and Cmax) as measures for drug exposure of NVP and EFV, were generated using a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared for patients with and without central nervous system (CNS) and psychiatric AEs, hepatic events, liver enzyme elevations (LEEs) and rash. Furthermore, it was investigated whether a clear cut-off for a pharmacokinetic parameter could be identified above which the incidence of AEs was clearly increased. AEs were also related to demographic parameters and baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In total, from 1077 patients, NVP (3024 samples) and EFV (1694 samples) plasma concentrations and AE data (825 observations) were available. For all patients Cmin, Cmax and AUC24h were determined. When corrected for known covariates of gender, CD4 cell count at baseline, region, hepatitis coinfection and possible interactions between these factors, no significant associations between AEs and any tested exposure parameter of NVP was observed. Also, no target Cmin value, above which patients were at increased risk for AEs, could be established. On the other hand, geographical region, hepatitis coinfection, CD4 cell count and gender were found to be significantly related with the incidence of CNS and psychiatric AEs, hepatic events, LEEs and rash during the treatment with NVP. The occurrence of elevated liver enzymes during the first 6 weeks in the EFV-containing arm was significantly (P = 0.036) correlated to the exposure of EFV (Cmin). Only hepatitis coinfection impacted on LEEs during the first 6 weeks of treatment. With an EFV Cmin above 2.18 mg/l during the induction phase, patients were 4.4 (range 1.3-15.5) times more at risk for elevated liver enzymes. No other correlations between AEs and EFV pharmacokinetics or patient characteristics could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic parameters of NVP did not have a relationship to AEs in the 2NN trial when corrected for known covariates. The value of periodical drug monitoring of NVP as a way to prevent toxicity is therefore limited. Treating physicians should instead focus on factors that are more predictive of AEs (gender, CD4 count and hepatitis coinfection). High EFV Cmin levels resulted in elevated liver enzyme values during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Regular measurement of EFV levels and liver enzymes at the start of therapy may therefore be advised.",1
2007,6424398,"Side effects of carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam during long-term treatment of epilepsy","""Side effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) are rare during long-term use but rather common and usually transient during the early phases of treatment. The usual side effects of CBZ are drowsiness, dizziness, and diplopia, which are dose dependent in long-term use, but CBZ does not seem to cause cognitive disturbances, as do phenobarbital and phenytoin. Other reactions to CBZ may include leukopenia, hyponatremia, disturbances of vitamin D metabolism and fortunately rarely, agranulocytosis and hepatitis. Use of VPA can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, weight gain, hair loss, tremor and sedation, but these side effects are rather uncommon, mild, and transient during VPA monotherapy. Potentially hazardous reactions such as hepatitis and pancreatitis have occurred in a few patients on VPA, generally with multidrug therapy. Some of the side effects are dose related. They infrequently lead to withdrawal of VPA. Side effects limited to initiation of CZP therapy include drowsiness, ataxia, and behavioral changes; they are usually transient but can lead to dose reduction or even withdrawal of the drug. Except for development of tolerance, CZP seems to be practically free of long-term side effects.""",1

The search for biological markers has developed in two general directions: (1) to identify by genetic studies patients with a high probability of developing cancer who will provide insight into biochemical changes as premalignant lesions develop into frankly developed cancer, and (2) to fine differences between tissue and body fluid constituents in normal subjects and patients with cancer. Screening for colon cancer is discussed with a selective diagnostic approach and with emphasis on this approach in early diagnosis of asymptomatic high risk patients. ",0
2009,3653851,Acinar redistribution and heterogeneity in transport of the organic cation rhodamine B in rat liver,"We studied a possible acinar heterogeneity in the transport of organic cations, using rhodamine B as model compound. Employing perfusions of isolated rat livers in the ante- and retrograde mode and quantitative fluorescence microscopy, Zones 1 and 3 were shown to be equally efficient in taking up rhodamine B. Ten minutes after injection in an antegrade perfusion, 95% of the dose was localized in the portal half of the acinus. Fifty minutes later, however, the amount of rhodamine B in Zone 1 had been reduced to 23%; 30 and 31% were in Zones 2 and 3, respectively, and the medium concentration was doubled. Thus, unchanged rhodamine B appeared to be transported downstream within the liver, either via the medium or directly from cell to cell, finally resulting in a relatively higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3. To obtain additional data, we designed a perfusion setup in which the zones could be studied separately. In both zones, the amount excreted into the medium was about 30 times the amount excreted into bile. Intracellular sequestration of rhodamine B and the rate constant for sinusoidal secretion were higher in Zone 3, while the sinusoidal uptake rates were equal; biliary excretion was higher in Zone 1. Acinar distribution changed with time because rhodamine B, primarily accumulated in Zone 1, was secreted into the sinusoids and taken up again by downstream cells. The finally higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3 was caused by a zonal heterogeneity in intracellular sequestration and sinusoidal secretion of rhodamine B.",0
2010,1937381,Intraobserver and interobserver variation in the histopathological assessment of liver allograft rejection. The Liver Transplantation Database (LTD) Investigators,"A study to determine the reproducibility of histopathological findings and diagnoses of rejection was carried out on a series of 42 liver allograft needle biopsy specimens by five pathologists practicing at four liver transplant centers. Pathologists from each of the four centers read each slide independently on two different occasions and were asked to assess 12 histopathological features and render a diagnosis. For all histological variables, the intrarater agreement was higher than the interrater agreement. Moderate to excellent agreement occurred among the pathologists about all histological variables thought to be important in establishing the diagnosis of acute rejection (i.e., portal tract inflammation, subendothelial inflammation and bile duct damage). Other variables such as lobular disarray, bile duct proliferation and particularly arteritis, however, were only fairly or poorly reproducible. Surprisingly, the diagnosis of acute rejection was more reproducible than the individual histopathological findings that were thought to be the basis for the diagnosis. The agreement for the diagnosis of chronic rejection, however, varied according to observer. We noted that relatively inexperienced observers within this group had some difficulties agreeing with more experienced observers in establishing a diagnosis of chronic rejection. These findings demonstrate that the histopathological diagnosis of acute cellular liver allograft rejection is highly reproducible within a group of experienced pathologists and that this diagnosis can be pooled in a common data base with confidence.",0

2012,30764939,A Comparative Analysis of ZnO Nanorods and Nanopencils Towards Amperometric Biosensing Applications,"In this work, ZnO Nanorods (ZNR) and Nanopencils (ZNP) were synthesized over Platinum (Pt) coated glass substrate by simple and low-temperature hydrothermal process for large-scale fabrication towards biosensing applications. The two types of morphologies have been obtained by using strong oxidizing agent viz KMnO₄ as an additive and replenishing the growth solution during the hydrothermal growth process. It was observed that incorporation of additive and replacement of growth solution has greatly influenced structural and electrochemical properties of ZNR/ZNP in terms of morphology, aspect ratio, and charge transfer hindrance. The aspect ratio has been found to increase by approximately three times from ZNR to ZNP which facilitated higher enzyme loading over ZNP as compared to ZNR. Moreover, electrochemical charge transport resistance was found to decrease by 36 times with changes in morphology and aspect ratio. Hence, significant variation in performance of as-fabricated enzymatic biosensor was observed. Amidst both the types of biosensors four-fold increment in sensitivity was found from ZNR to ZNP along with fast response time of 5s and a linear range of operation of 0.5-7.5 mM. The obtained results revealed that aspect ratio could be tuned efficiently by replacing the growth solution during hydrothermal growth which cognitively effects enzyme loading thereby influencing different figure of merits of the biosensor.

2013,21696307,Telaprevir for previously untreated chronic hepatitis C virus infection,"""BACKGROUND: In phase 2 trials, telaprevir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 protease inhibitor, in combination with peginterferon-ribavirin, as compared with peginterferon-ribavirin alone, has shown improved efficacy, with potential for shortening the duration of treatment in a majority of patients. METHODS: In this international, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 1088 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who had not received previous treatment for the infection to one of three groups: a group receiving telaprevir combined with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 12 weeks (T12PR group), followed by peginterferon-ribavirin alone for 12 weeks if HCV RNA was undetectable at weeks 4 and 12 or for 36 weeks if HCV RNA was detectable at either time point; a group receiving telaprevir with peginterferon-ribavirin for 8 weeks and placebo with peginterferon-ribavirin for 4 weeks (T8PR group), followed by 12 or 36 weeks of peginterferon-ribavirin on the basis of the same HCV RNA criteria; or a group receiving placebo with peginterferon-ribavirin for 12 weeks, followed by 36 weeks of peginterferon-ribavirin (PR group). The primary end point was the proportion of patients who had undetectable plasma HCV RNA 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment (sustained virologic response). RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the T12PR or T8PR group than in the PR group had a sustained virologic response (75% and 69%, respectively, vs. 44%; P<0.001 for the comparison of the T12PR or T8PR group with the PR group). A total of 58% of the patients treated with telaprevir were eligible to receive 24 weeks of total treatment. Anemia, gastrointestinal side effects, and skin rashes occurred at a higher incidence among patients receiving telaprevir than among those receiving peginterferon-ribavirin alone. The overall rate of discontinuation of the treatment regimen owing to adverse events was 10% in the T12PR and T8PR groups and 7% in the PR group. CONCLUSIONS: Telaprevir with peginterferon-ribavirin, as compared with peginterferon-ribavirin alone, was associated with significantly improved rates of sustained virologic response in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who had not received previous treatment, with only 24 weeks of therapy administered in the majority of patients.

2014,7678261,Involvement of immediate-early gene expression in the synergistic effects of steel factor in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3 on proliferation of a human factor-dependent cell line,"Steel factor (SLF) synergizes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) to stimulate proliferation of human factor-dependent cell line, MO7e. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying this synergism, induction of immediate-early genes was studied. Treatment of MO7e cells with SLF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 induced/enhanced expression of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes. SLF treatment of MO7e cells led to higher expression of c-fos, junB, and egr-1 genes than did treatment with GM-CSF or IL-3. However, GM-CSF and IL-3 had more prolonged effects on enhancement of the c-myc gene than SLF. Using optimal dosages for cell proliferation, induction of c-fos and junB was greater than additive with SLF plus GM-CSF or IL-3, as compared with each factor alone. Using suboptimal amounts of SLF with optimal GM-CSF or IL-3, induction of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes was greater than additive. De novo protein synthesis was not required for greater induction of these immediate-early genes by the combination of SLF plus GM-CSF. Based on nuclear run-on and actinomycin D experiments, the data suggest that the synergistic effects of SLF plus GM-CSF on the induction of immediate-early genes may be mediated in part at the level of transcription and mRNA stabilization for c-fos, at the level of mRNA stabilization for junB, and at the level of transcription for egr-1.

2015,3034543,[Epidemiological and clinical aspects of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. An assessment of 886 cases],"""The objective of this study was to check whether there is a link between focalnodular hepatic hyperplasia of the liver and use of birth control pills, and if so, what it is. Focalnodular hepatic hyperplasias consists of hepatocytes, Kupffer's cells, proliferating hepatic ducts, connective tissue and vessels. Characteristically, on the cut surface of a focalnodular hyperplasia specimen is central, star shaped scar tissue with radial branches. The nodular tissue is sharply delineated from the surrounding liver tissue without actually forming an anatomic capsule. Based on the literature and authors' observations 886 cases were assembled for analysis. Results are as follows: Roughly 20% of tumors occur in children and adolescents, barely 18% in males. Use of steroid hormones for contraceptive purposes was found in only 27.8% of patients. Tumor size does not correlate with length of use of birth control pills. In males and patients under 20, tumors are on the average larger than in women and patients over 19. On the other hand, birth control pills are assumed to promote growth of an existing focalnodular hyperplasia for the following reason: Women using oral contraceptives on the average have larger tumors than non-users; oral contraceptive users are younger than the comparison group when the diagnosis is made; symptoms occur more frequently among pill user; however, it is concluded that oral contraceptives can be precluded as a causal pathogenetic factor in focalnodular hyperplasia.""",1
2016,11535846,"Relationship between APC genotype, polyp distribution, and oral sulindac treatment in the colon and rectum of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis","PURPOSE: Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by the presence of multiple adenomatous colorectal polyps. Molecular studies have revealed that germline mutations in the APC gene are the underlying cause of the disease. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent sulindac has been shown to reduce the number of colorectal adenomas. Most sulindac trials in the large bowel have focused on the distal colon and relatively little is known about its effect on the proximal colon. Moreover, it is unknown whether the site of the APC mutation affects the efficacy of sulindac. METHODS: This study investigated whether there were regional differences in the effect of sulindac on the colon and whether response to sulindac was dependent on the site of mutation in the APC gene. In an open prospective study 17 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis were treated with 300 mg oral sulindac daily for four months followed by a washout phase of six months. Ten of the patients had an intact colon and seven had rectal stumps only. The number, size, and the degree of dysplasia of the adenomas were evaluated by colonoscopy at entry, end of treatment and end of the study. RESULTS: Overall, a statistically significant decrease in the number of adenomas was observed (120 +/- 112 to 28 +/- 64, P = 0.007). After cessation of sulindac treatment the number of adenomas increased to 48 +/- 44.5, but remained significantly lower than the values observed at baseline. In the ten patients with intact colons, adenomas decreased by sevenfold in the proximal colon (103 +/- 73 to 15.1 +/- 47.4, P = 0.011) and twofold in the distal colon (80 +/- 52 to 29.6 +/- 37.2, P = 0.005). The size of adenomas and the grade of dysplasia also decreased. No correlation could be seen between the APC mutation site and the response to treatment. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that sulindac reduces the number of adenomas in the entire colon and that the effect seems to be more pronounced in the proximal colon.",1

This case highlights the importance of health care providers documenting non-prescribed dietary supplements and considering them in the etiology of cholestatic liver disease.",1
2018,7813622,Molecular characterization of a type I serine-threonine kinase receptor for TGF-beta and activin in the rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3,"GH3 pituitary tumor cells have surface receptors for transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta s) and activins/inhibins. GH3 cell mRNA was screened by a novel reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique with primers for receptor serine-threonine kinases. We isolated rat homologs of previously identified clones for type I (ALK-2 and ALK-5) and type II (ActRII, TGF-beta RII) activin and TGF-beta receptors, together with a novel clone, whose full-length version was isolated from a GH3 cell cDNA library. Named B1, it encodes a 505-amino-acid protein belonging to the family of type I receptor serine/threonine kinases. The kinase domain of B1 exhibits 90% identity to that of the TGF-beta type I receptor. B1 mRNA is expressed not only in pituitary cells but also in all other cells and tissues examined. B1 protein can be expressed on the cell surface, but cannot bind ligand unless a type II receptor is also present. When coexpressed with the type II receptors specific for TGF-beta or activin, B1 can be efficiently cross-linked to either ligand, suggesting that it can form heteromeric complexes with both type II receptor subunits.

2019,23178933,Analysis of anonymous pooled urine from portable urinals in central London confirms the significant use of novel psychoactive substances,"AIM: Analysis of urine samples collected across a city centre, for the detection of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of anonymized urine samples used for the analysis of classical recreational drugs, NPS and metabolites. METHODS: Pooled urine samples collected from portable stand-alone four-person urinals across a city centre were analysed using full-scan accurate-mass high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Data were processed against compound databases containing >1700 drug compounds and metabolites. RESULTS: Seven established recreational drugs (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, cocaine, cannabis, ketamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, methamphetamine and amphetamine) and six potential NPS [hordenine (all 12 urinals), cathine (11), methylhexaneamine (9), 4-methylmethcathinone (6), methiopropamine and metabolites (2) and methoxetamine and metabolites (1)] were detected. Methylhexaneamine, methiopropamine and hordenine are currently uncontrolled in the UK, whereas methoxetamine is currently subject to a Temporary Class Drug Order. Metabolites of the anabolic steroid nandrolone were found in two urinals and trenbolone metabolites and clenbuterol in one urinal. CONCLUSION: Analysis of pooled urine samples collected anonymously from stand-alone urinals in a large inner city can detect the use of recreational drugs, NPS and anabolic steroids. Metabolite detection indicates actual drug use, metabolism and elimination rather than simply discarded drugs in the urinals. This technique by confirming the actual drug(s) used has the potential to be additive to currently used datasets/key indicators providing more robust information for healthcare authorities, legislative and law enforcement on the drugs actually being used.",1
2020,14963199,Folate supplementation and methotrexate treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: a review,"""OBJECTIVES: The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has become established as the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is commonly discontinued due to adverse effects. Adverse effects are thought to be mediated via folate antagonism. In this paper we summarize the current data on the use of folates as a supplement to MTX use in RA for the prevention of adverse effects and as a potential modulator of cardiovascular risk, and propose guidelines for standard practice. METHODS: A Medline search was performed using the search terms """"methotrexate"""", """"folic acid"""", """"folinic acid"""", """"folate"""" and """"homocysteine"""". Literature relevant to the use of folates as a supplement to MTX in the treatment of RA was reviewed and other papers referred to as references were explored. RESULTS: The use of supplemental folates, including folic and folinic acid, in RA patients treated with MTX has been shown to improve continuation rates by reducing the incidence of liver function test abnormalities and gastrointestinal intolerance. Folate supplements do not appear to significantly reduce the effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, supplemental folic acid offsets the elevation in plasma homocysteine associated with the use of MTX. This may in turn reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is over-represented amongst patients with RA, and for which hyperhomocysteinaemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that folic acid supplements be prescribed routinely to all patients receiving MTX for the treatment of RA. We recommend a pragmatic dosing schedule of 5 mg of oral folic acid given on the morning following the day of MTX administration.""",1
2021,15044509,Expression of adrenomedullin and its receptors in human salivary tissue,"Adrenomedullin is a multifunctional peptide produced by a wide range of different cells and tissues. This study was designed to investigate whether adrenomedullin is present in human saliva and in salivary glands. It was expected that saliva may contain high concentrations of adrenomedullin, which has antimicrobial activity in vitro, which may have functional implications in the oral cavity. Saliva from the submandibular and parotid glands contained higher concentrations of adrenomedullin than did the circulation, but lower concentrations than in whole saliva. This suggests that oral epithelium may contribute the majority of the adrenomedullin peptide found in saliva. Specific adrenomedullin receptors were found in cell lines from the submandibular (HSG) and parotid (HSY) salivary glands. These findings suggest a paracrine/autocrine role for adrenomedullin in these tissues; however, the concentration of adrenomedullin in saliva was insufficient to suggest a significant antimicrobial action in the healthy oral cavity.

2022,22970944,PTEN mutations as a cause of constitutive insulin sensitivity and obesity,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and genetic evidence links type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer. The tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) has roles in both cellular growth and metabolic signaling. Germline PTEN mutations cause a cancer-predisposition syndrome, providing an opportunity to study the effect of PTEN haploinsufficiency in humans. METHODS: We measured insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in 15 PTEN mutation carriers and 15 matched controls. Insulin signaling was measured in muscle and adipose-tissue biopsy specimens from 5 mutation carriers and 5 well-matched controls. We also assessed the effect of PTEN haploinsufficiency on obesity by comparing anthropometric indexes between the 15 patients and 2097 controls from a population-based study of healthy adults. Body composition was evaluated by means of dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry and skinfold thickness. RESULTS: Measures of insulin resistance were lower in the patients with a PTEN mutation than in controls (e.g., mean fasting plasma insulin level, 29 pmol per liter [range, 9 to 99] vs. 74 pmol per liter [range, 22 to 185]; P=0.001). This finding was confirmed with the use of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamping, showing a glucose infusion rate among carriers 2 times that among controls (P=0.009). The patients' insulin sensitivity could be explained by the presence of enhanced insulin signaling through the PI3K-AKT pathway, as evidenced by increased AKT phosphorylation. The PTEN mutation carriers were obese as compared with population-based controls (mean body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 32 [range, 23 to 42] vs. 26 [range, 15 to 48]; P<0.001). This increased body mass in the patients was due to augmented adiposity without corresponding changes in fat distribution. CONCLUSIONS: PTEN haploinsufficiency is a monogenic cause of profound constitutive insulin sensitization that is apparently obesogenic. We demonstrate an apparently divergent effect of PTEN mutations: increased risks of obesity and cancer but a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes owing to enhanced insulin sensitivity.

Axitinib dose titration might optimise exposure and improve outcomes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of axitinib dose titration in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients were enrolled from 49 hospitals and outpatient clinics in the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Russia, Spain, and USA. Patients with treatment-naive metastatic renal-cell carcinoma received axitinib 5 mg twice daily during a 4 week lead-in period. Those patients with blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg or lower, no grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxic effects, no dose reductions, and no more than two antihypertensive drugs for 2 consecutive weeks were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1), and then randomly assigned (1:1) to either masked titration with axitinib to total twice daily doses of 7 mg, and then 10 mg, if tolerated, or placebo titration. Patients who did not meet these criteria continued without titration. The primary objective was comparison of the proportion of patients achieving an objective response between randomised groups. Safety analyses were based on all patients who received at least one dose of axitinib. FINDINGS: Between Sept 2, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, we enrolled 213 patients, of whom 112 were randomly assigned to either the axitinib titration group (56 patients) or the placebo titration group (56 patients). 91 were not eligible for titration, and ten withdrew during the lead-in period. 30 patients (54%, 95% CI 40-67) in the axitinib titration group had an objective response, as did 19 patients (34%, 22-48]) in the placebo titration group (one-sided p=0?019). 54 (59%, 95% CI 49-70) of non-randomised patients achieved an objective response. Common grade 3 or worse, all-causality adverse events in treated patients were hypertension (ten [18%] of 56 in the axitinib titration group vs five [9%] of 56 in the placebo titration group vs 45 [49%] of 91 in the non-randomised group), diarrhoea (seven [13%] vs two [4%] vs eight [9%]), and decreased weight (four [7%] vs three [5%] vs six [7%]). One or more all-causality serious adverse events were reported in 15 (27%) patients in the axitinib titration group, 13 (23%) patients in the placebo titration group, and 35 (38%) non-randomised patients. The most common serious adverse events in all 213 patients were disease progression and dehydration (eight each [4%]), and diarrhoea, vomiting, pneumonia, and decreased appetite (four each [2%]). INTERPRETATION: The greater proportion of patients in the axitinib titration group achieving an objective response supports the concept of individual axitinib dose titration in selected patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. Axitinib shows clinical activity with a manageable safety profile in treatment-naive patients with this disease.",1
2025,3275523,A clinical trial of buprenorphine: comparison with methadone in the detoxification of heroin addicts,"The efficacy of buprenorphine and methadone was compared in the outpatient detoxification of heroin addicts. Forty-five patients were randomized to receive either sublingual buprenorphine or oral methadone under double-dummy and double-blind conditions to study the pharmacology of buprenorphine in a 90-day detoxification protocol. The patients were administered either 2 mg buprenorphine or 30 mg methadone for 3 weeks followed by 4 weeks of dose reductions and 6 weeks of placebo medication. No significant between-group differences were seen on measures of treatment retention, drug use, or symptom report. During the hydromorphone challenge, methadone attenuated opioid effects to a greater extent than did buprenorphine on both physiologic (pupil constriction) and self-report measures. However, this did not result in greater abuse of illicit opioid drugs by subjects taking buprenorphine. The results of this clinical trial indicated that buprenorphine was acceptable to patients and as effective as methadone in the detoxification treatment of heroin addicts.",1
2026,2925159,Studies on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism by low- and high-density lipoproteins in HepG2 cells,The uptake and degradation of low-density lipoproteins and the esterification and synthesis of cholesterol were poorly down-regulated by low-density lipoproteins in HepG2 cells. Addition of low-density lipoproteins to the cells increased the free and esterified cholesterol in the cells. The heavier fraction of high-density lipoproteins enhanced the degradation of low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol synthesis and decreased acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. Addition of the heavier fraction of high-density lipoproteins also caused a net efflux of cholesterol from HepG2 cells. The lighter fraction did not have any significant effect on cholesterol metabolism or cellular cholesterol level.

In addition to drugs that release or mimic the effect of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), this could include drugs that inhibit: reuptake of norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin); bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or the cannabinoid receptors; and some peptides that reduce food intake. The sympathomimetic drugs phentermine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendimetrazine--so named because they mimic many effects of norepinephrine--are only approved in a few countries, and then only for short-term use. Sibutramine, a norepinephrine-5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor, is approved for long-term use. Several new mechanisms for drug action are under investigation. Appetite suppressants should be viewed as useful adjuncts to diet and physical activity and might help selected patients to achieve and maintain weight loss.""",1
2028,11640959,Promotion of neural cell adhesion by electrochemically generated and functionalized polymer films,"""New strategies for spatially controllable cell adhesion have been developed for brain cells from embryonic chicken. They are based on electrochemically active phenol and pyrrole derivatives, and can be used for the selective coverage of electroconductive substrates. Besides mimicking standard laminin-related adhesion promoting mechanisms by means of an electroactive monomer-linked 18-peptide segment from laminin (SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR), electrochemically generated thin (6-30 nm) polymer films of 3-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine (3HBH) and 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol (2(3HP)E) with and without mechanically entrapped or covalently linked D-lysine have proved to promote cell adhesion in serum-free medium on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates during the first 6 culturing days in vitro. The effectiveness of the peptide was strongly density-dependent. Unexpectedly, laminin itself or a combination of laminin and poly-D-lysine (PDL) did not promote cell adhesion and neuron differentiation in serum-free cultures on ITO. However, they worked perfectly well on regular polystyrene substrates in serum-free medium or on ITO when medium with serum was used. This finding might suggest that the adhesion efficiency of laminin does not depend only on the kind of medium supplement but also on the type of substrate. In contrast, the adhesion-promoting properties of """"artificial"""" polymeric films seemed to be based on a more direct cell-film interaction, with the film masking the substrate properties. """,0

The patient was not a carrier of HLA-B5701, and abacavir hypersensitivity was unlikely. We believe this is the first report of severe dolutegravir-related hepatotoxicity resulting in sub-acute liver failure and transplantation and highlights a potential need for closer monitoring after drug initiation.",1
2030,19444872,Single nucleotide polymorphism-mediated translational suppression of endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I modifies the onset of end-stage liver disease in alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency,"Inappropriate accumulation of the misfolded Z variant of alpha1-antitrypsin in the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a risk factor for the development of end-stage liver disease. However, the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its etiology are poorly understood. ER mannosidase I (ERManI) is a quality control factor that plays a critical role in the sorting and targeting of misfolded glycoproteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. In this study, we tested whether genetic variations in the human ERManI gene influence the age at onset of end-stage liver disease in patients homozygous for the Z allele (ZZ). We sequenced all 13 exons in a group of unrelated Caucasian ZZ transplant recipients with different age at onset of the end-stage liver disease. Homozygosity for the minor A allele at 2484G/A (refSNP ID number rs4567) in the 3'-untranslated region was prevalent in the infant ZZ patients. Functional studies indicated that rs4567(A), but not rs4567(G), suppresses ERManI translation under ER stress conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism can accelerate the onset of the end-stage liver disease associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and underscore the contribution of biosynthetic quality control as a modifier of genetic disease.",0

2032,19776405,High-dose daunorubicin in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia,"BACKGROUND: A complete remission is essential for prolonging survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Daunorubicin is a cornerstone of the induction regimen, but the optimal dose is unknown. In older patients, it is usual to give daunorubicin at a dose of 45 to 50 mg per square meter of body-surface area. METHODS: Patients in whom AML or high-risk refractory anemia had been newly diagnosed and who were 60 to 83 years of age (median, 67) were randomly assigned to receive cytarabine, at a dose of 200 mg per square meter by continuous infusion for 7 days, plus daunorubicin for 3 days, either at the conventional dose of 45 mg per square meter (411 patients) or at an escalated dose of 90 mg per square meter (402 patients); this treatment was followed by a second cycle of cytarabine at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter every 12 hours [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] for 6 days. The primary end point was event-free survival. RESULTS: The complete remission rates were 64% in the group that received the escalated dose of daunorubicin and 54% in the group that received the conventional dose (P=0.002); the rates of remission after the first cycle of induction treatment were 52% and 35%, respectively (P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of hematologic toxic effects, 30-day mortality (11% and 12% in the two groups, respectively), or the incidence of moderate, severe, or life-threatening adverse events (P=0.08). Survival end points in the two groups did not differ significantly overall, but patients in the escalated-treatment group who were 60 to 65 years of age, as compared with the patients in the same age group who received the conventional dose, had higher rates of complete remission (73% vs. 51%), event-free survival (29% vs. 14%), and overall survival (38% vs. 23%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AML who are older than 60 years of age, escalation of the dose of daunorubicin to twice the conventional dose, with the entire dose administered in the first induction cycle, effects a more rapid response and a higher response rate than does the conventional dose, without additional toxic effects.

2033,20648475,Bmi1 promotes hepatic stem cell expansion and tumorigenicity in both Ink4a/Arf-dependent and -independent manners in mice,"We previously reported that forced expression of Bmi1 (B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog) in murine hepatic stem/progenitor cells purified from fetal liver enhances their self-renewal and drives cancer initiation. In the present study, we examined the contribution of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus, one of the major targets of Bmi1, to stem cell expansion and cancer initiation. Bmi1(-/-) Delta-like protein (Dlk)(+) hepatic stem/progenitor cells showed de-repression of the Ink4a/Arf locus and displayed impaired growth activity. In contrast, Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells gave rise to considerably larger colonies containing a greater number of bipotent cells than wild-type Dlk(+) cells. Although Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells did not initiate tumors in recipient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, enforced expression of Bmi1 in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells further augmented their self-renewal capacity and resulted in tumor formation in vivo. Microarray analyses successfully identified five down-regulated genes as candidate downstream targets for Bmi1 in hepatic stem/progenitor cells. Of these genes, enforced expression of sex determining region Y-box 17 (Sox17) in Dlk(+) cells strongly suppressed colony propagation and tumor growth. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that repression of targets of Bmi1 other than the Ink4a/Arf locus plays a crucial role in the oncogenic transformation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells. Functional analyses of Bmi1 target genes would be of importance to elucidate the molecular machinery underlying hepatic stem cell system and explore therapeutic approaches for the eradication of liver cancer stem cells.",0
2034,27074035,Two-Year Costs and Quality in the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative,"BACKGROUND: The 4-year, multipayer Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative was started in October 2012 to determine whether several forms of support would produce changes in care delivery that would improve the quality and reduce the costs of care at 497 primary care practices in seven regions across the United States. Support included the provision of care-management fees, the opportunity to earn shared savings, and the provision of data feedback and learning support. METHODS: We tracked changes in the delivery of care by practices participating in the initiative and used difference-in-differences regressions to compare changes over the first 2 years of the initiative in Medicare expenditures, health care utilization, claims-based measures of quality, and patient experience for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries attributed to initiative practices and a group of matched comparison practices. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, initiative practices received a median of $115,000 per clinician in care-management fees. The practices reported improvements in approaches to the delivery of primary care in areas such as management of the care of high-risk patients and enhanced access to care. Changes in average monthly Medicare expenditures per beneficiary did not differ significantly between initiative and comparison practices when care-management fees were not taken into account (-$11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -$23 to $1; P=0.07; negative values indicate less growth in spending at initiative practices) or when these fees were taken into account ($7; 95% CI, -$5 to $19; P=0.27). The only significant differences in other measures were a 3% reduction in primary care visits for initiative practices relative to comparison practices (P<0.001) and changes in two of the six domains of patient experience--discussion of decisions regarding medication with patients and the provision of support for patients taking care of their own health--both of which showed a small improvement in initiative practices relative to comparison practices (P=0.006 and P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Midway through this 4-year intervention, practices participating in the initiative have reported progress in transforming the delivery of primary care. However, at this point these practices have not yet shown savings in expenditures for Medicare Parts A and B after accounting for care-management fees, nor have they shown an appreciable improvement in the quality of care or patient experience.

2035,16147828,Correlation between visual examination of the cervix and digital examination,"To determine the correlation between visual assessment of the cervix and digital examination. Prospective study of patients presenting to Labor and Delivery. Exclusion criteria were preterm premature ruptured membranes (PPROM) and placenta previa. Visual and digital assessments of cervical dilation, effacement, position, and station of fetal presenting part were made. Correlation between visual and digital examinations was measured using Spearman rank correlation coefficient (COR). A p-value<0.05 was considered significant. The study involved a total of 107 patients at a mean gestational age of 32.3 weeks (range 17-41). Seven patients had ruptured membranes, and 46 were nulliparous. Visual assessment correlated with digital examination for all parameters measured with Spearman rank correlation coefficients between 0.618 and 0.686 (all significant at p<0.001). Correlations between visual and digital assessment of cervical dilation, effacement, station, and position were not as strong (0.291-0.699), but remained significant (p<0.02) in a subgroup of 50 preterm patients<34 weeks gestation.

2041,8491453,Futile cycling between 4-methylumbelliferone and its conjugates in perfused rat liver,"Futile cycling between 4-methylumbelliferone and its sulfate and glucuronide conjugates was examined in the single-pass perfused rat liver preparation. The steady-state hepatic extraction ratio of 4-methylumbelliferone was found to be high (0.97) at a low input concentration of 0.005 mumol/L (tracer), with a net 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate/4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide ratio of about 5:1; at 63 mumol/L the steady-state extraction ratio had remained constant despite a shift from net sulfation to net glucuronidation. At higher input 4-methylumbelliferone concentrations, saturation was evidenced by a decreased steady-state extraction ratio and reduced net sulfation and net glucuronidation. Because 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide deconjugation would result in an intracellular accumulation of 4-methylumbelliferone, the phenomenon was monitored with a shift in tracer [3H]4-methylumbelliferone metabolism from sulfation to glucuronidation with increased intracellular 4-methylumbelliferone concentration. When 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (0 to 890 mumol/L) or 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (0 to 460 mumol/L) was delivered simultaneously with tracer [3H]4-methylumbelliferone to the rat liver, notable desulfation of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (18% to 38% rate in) but little deglucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (1.2% to 2.1% rate in) was observed. With 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate, 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide were readily found as metabolites, whereas with 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide, levels of the metabolites, 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate, were much reduced. 4-Methylumbelliferyl sulfate and not 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide shifted tracer [3H]4-methylumbelliferone metabolism from [3H]4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate to [3H]4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide formation in a concentration-dependent fashion. The steady-state extraction ratio for 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (0.1 to 0.3) was comparatively higher than that for 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (0.05), and it was found to increase with concentration, an observation explained by the nonlinear protein binding of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. Biliary excretion rates for 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate were proportional to their input or net formation rates, regardless of whether 4-methylumbelliferone, 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide or 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate was administered. By contrast, the excretion rate of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide when administered was only 1/25 the excretion of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide formed from 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. The extent of choleresis paralleled the excretion patterns of preformed and formed 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide; bile flow was normal with 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide administration and was markedly enhanced with increased 4-methylumbelliferone or 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate administration. The data suggest the presence of a transmembrane barrier for entry of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide and not 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate or 4-methylumbelliferone into hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0

The serum MTX level peaked rapidly and was insignificant after 24 hours. The red blood cell MTX level was not related to the interval from the last MTX dose. In hepatic tissue obtained by liver biopsy, MTX was found in a predominantly polyglutamated form with depleted hepatic folate stores when compared with baseline specimens. A brief period of therapy with oral folinic acid repleted hepatic folate. It is possible that MTX hepatotoxicity is related to reduced hepatic folate levels and formation of MTX polyglutamates.",1

This has an important implication on the choice of antiviral treatment (AVT), given that long-term safety would be a concern in the presence of multiple comorbidities. We aimed to determine the prevalence of key comorbidities and concomitant medications in a territory-wide CHB cohort in Hong Kong in 2000-2017. CHB patients who have been under the care at primary, secondary, and tertiary medical centers in the public sector were identified through the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. The demographics and prevalence of key comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, osteopenia/osteoporosis based on diagnosis codes, relevant medications, and/or laboratory parameters, were determined according to CHB patients' first appearance in four time periods: 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2013, and 2014-2017.

2047,25242332,PROX1 promotes metabolic adaptation and fuels outgrowth of Wnt(high) metastatic colon cancer cells,"The Wnt pathway is abnormally activated in the majority of colorectal cancers, and significant knowledge has been gained in understanding its role in tumor initiation. However, the mechanisms of metastatic outgrowth in colorectal cancer remain a major challenge. We report that autophagy-dependent metabolic adaptation and survival of metastatic colorectal cancer cells is regulated by the target of oncogenic Wnt signaling, homeobox transcription factor PROX1, expressed by a subpopulation of colon cancer progenitor/stem cells. We identify direct PROX1 target genes and show that repression of a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL2 family, BCL2L15, is important for survival of PROX1(+) cells under metabolic stress. PROX1 inactivation after the establishment of metastases prevented further growth of lesions. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition efficiently targeted metastatic PROX1(+) cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach. These data identify PROX1 as a key regulator of the transcriptional network contributing to metastases outgrowth in colorectal cancer.  ",0

This retrospective observational study aimed to determine whether we could predict response to exenatide in patients with T2DM. 112 patients on exenatide were included with patient age, gender, duration of T2DM, medications alongside exenatide and weight, BMI, and HbA1c at baseline and 3 and 6 months of exenatide use being recorded. 63 responded with 11 mmol/mol reduction from baseline HbA1c after six months and 49 did not respond to exenatide. HbA1c solely differed significantly between cohorts at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months (P < 0.05). Regression analyses identified a negative linear relationship with higher baseline HbA1c correlating to greater reductions in HbA1c by 6 months (P < 0.0001). HbA1c was the sole predictor of exenatide response with higher baseline HbA1c increasing the odds of response by 5% (P = 0.004).

We investigated whether the presence of precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants before PEG-IFN treatment affects serological and virological response. A total of 214 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with PEG-IFN � lamivudine for 52 weeks in a global randomized trial were classified at baseline as wildtype (WT) or non-WT (detectable mutants at PC/BCP) by line-probe assay. Response was assessed at 6 months posttreatment and through long-term follow-up (LTFU). Mutants were detected in 64% of patients, in varying frequencies across HBV genotypes A through D. Patients with WT had higher baseline HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg levels than patients with non-WT. Patients with WT were more likely to achieve HBeAg loss with HBV DNA <10,000 copies/mL (response, 34 versus 11%, P < 0.001) and HBsAg clearance (18 versus 2%, P < 0.001) at week 78 than non-WT patients. Among WT patients who achieved HBeAg clearance at week 78, 78% had undetectable HBV DNA and 61% achieved HBsAg clearance at LTFU (versus 26% and 15% in non-WT patients, P < 0.001 for both). The presence of WT virus at baseline was an independent predictor of response (odds ratio [OR] 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-7.31, P = 0.023) and HBsAg clearance (OR 5.58, 95% CI: 1.26-24.63, P = 0.013) and patients with non-A genotypes with detectable mutants had a low probability of response. CONCLUSION: The presence of only WT virus at baseline is a strong predictor of response (HBeAg loss with HBV DNA <10,000 copies/mL) to PEG-IFN for HBeAg-positive CHB. Patients with detectable PC and/or BCP mutants have a lower probability of response and are less optimal candidates for PEG-IFN therapy.",0

Cases were classified according to their activity at the time of cardiac arrest and the amount of their habitual vigorous activity. From interviews with wives of a random sample of healthy men, we estimated the amount of time members of the community spent in vigorous activity. Among men with low levels of habitual activity, the relative risk of cardiac arrest during exercise compared with that at other times was 56 (95 per cent confidence limits, 23 to 131). The risk during exercise among men at the highest level of habitual activity was also elevated, but only by a factor of 5 (95 per cent confidence limits, 2 to 14). However, among the habitually vigorous men, the overall risk of cardiac arrest--i.e., during and not during vigorous activity--was only 40 per cent that of the sedentary men (95 per cent confidence limits, 0.23 to 0.67). Although the risk of primary cardiac arrest is transiently increased during vigorous exercise, habitual vigorous exercise is associated with an overall decreased risk of primary cardiac arrest.",0

2052,19648163,Gene polymorphisms in folate metabolizing enzymes in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia: effects on methotrexate-related toxicity and survival,"BACKGROUND: The antifolate agent methotrexate is an important component of maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although methotrexate-related toxicity is often a reason for interruption of chemotherapy. Prediction of toxicity is difficult because of inter-individual variability susceptibility to antileukemic agents. Methotrexate interferes with folate metabolism leading to depletion of reduced folates. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of polymorphisms for folate metabolizing enzymes with respect to toxicity and survival in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with methotrexate maintenance therapy. To this purpose, we evaluated possible associations between genotype and hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity and effects on survival at 2 years of follow-up in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the genes encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C>T) and in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 19 bp deletion) significantly increased the risk of hepatotoxicity in single (odds ratio 5.23, 95% confidence interval 1.13-21.95 and odds ratio 4.57, 95% confidence interval 1.01-20.77, respectively) and in combined analysis (odds ratio 6.82, 95% confidence interval 1.38-33.59). MTHFR 677C>T also increased the risk of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity, whilst thymidylate synthase 28 bp repeat polymorphism increased the risk of anemia (odds ratio 8.48, 95% confidence interval 2.00-36.09). Finally, patients with MTHFR 677TT had a decreased overall survival rate (hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 1.46-8.45). CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping of folate polymorphisms might be useful in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia to optimize methotrexate therapy, reducing the associated toxicity with possible effects on survival.",1
2053,10390252,Cost of chickenpox in Canada: part I. Cost of uncomplicated cases,"The purpose of this study was to assess the direct medical costs and productivity losses associated with uncomplicated chickenpox (no hospitalization) in Canada. A total of 179 otherwise healthy 1- to 9-year-old children with active chickenpox were recruited from schools, day care centers, and physician offices in 5 provinces. Direct medical (physician contacts, medication, and diagnostic tests) and nonmedical (personal expenses including child care) resources expended during the illness were determined by caregiver interview. Productivity losses attributable to the disease were determined by assessing caregiver time lost from work and daily activities. Unit costs for all resources were obtained from sources in 2 provinces, and per-patient treatment costs were determined from the patient, Ministry of Health, and societal perspectives. From a societal perspective, the per-case cost for children from 1 to 4 years of age and from 5 to 9 years of age was $370.2 and $236.5, respectively. Direct medical costs accounted for 10% of the total costs in both groups. The largest cost driver in patient care was caregiver productivity losses, which amounted to $316.5 in the younger age group and to $182.7 in the older age group. Based on an estimated yearly incidence of 344 656 cases of uncomplicated chickenpox in Canada, the total annual societal burden of the disease can be estimated at $109.2 million, with a cost to the Ministry of Health of $11.2 million. Chickenpox is one of the last common childhood diseases prevalent in Canada, and the uncomplicated disease, despite its rather benign course, imparts a large annual economic burden. ",0

2055,18946446,Relationship between blood groups and coronary artery disease,"There are mounting evidences of relationship of different blood groups to disease. For many years, ABO blood group has been associated with predisposition to both arterial and venous disorders, such as venous thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. To evaluate the relationship of ABO and Rhesus blood groups with coronary artery disease. Total ninety five patients with coronary artery disease admitted in the Cardiac Surgery Department of Zarina Sikhder Women Medical College, Dhaka, and ninety five healthy stuff of same Medical College were studied. Their ABO and Rhesus Blood Groups were determined by standard method in the department of Transfusion Medicine, Zarina Sikhder Women Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh with full support from the department of Transfusion Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka. The results obtained in this study show that the prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in blood group O is invariably higher than in all other ABO blood groups (p<0.05). It is striking that despite the fact that the most prevalent blood group among Bangladeshi people is phenotype B, the prevalence of CAD risk is associated with phenotype O (Odd ratio 2.034, 95% confidence interval 1.127 to 3.67). This suggests that a certain CAD risk is associated with phenotype O. Thus we conclude that, in Bangladeshi people, blood group phenotype O is associated with a substantially increased risk for CAD.

2056,26686406,"Elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma: final phase 2 results from the randomised, open-label, phase 1b-2 dose-escalation study","""BACKGROUND: Elotuzumab, an immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody targeting signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family member 7 (SLAMF7), selectively kills SLAMF7-expressing myeloma cells through direct activation and engagement of the innate immune system, and thus might have clinical benefit in the treatment of myeloma. In phase 1 of this phase 1b-2 study, 82% of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who were given elotuzumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone achieved an overall response. Here we report the final phase 2 results. METHODS: We did this randomised, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study (1703) at 17 hospitals in the USA, Canada, France, and Germany. Patients aged at least 18 years with confirmed, relapsed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and one to three previous therapies but no previous lenalidomide were eligible for phase 2. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg intravenous elotuzumab plus oral lenalidomide (25 mg) and dexamethasone (40 mg). We stratified patients on the basis of the number of previous therapies (one versus two or three), and status of previous treatment with immunomodulatory drugs (yes or no), and used permuted block randomisation with a block size of four. Treatment was given in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred (elotuzumab was given on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for cycles 1 to 2 and days 1 and 15 for subsequent cycles; lenalidomide was given on days 1-21 and dexamethasone once per week). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drugs. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00742560. FINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2010, and Dec 21, 2010, we recruited and randomly assigned 73 patients to elotuzumab (36 to 10 mg/kg, 37 to 20 mg/kg). At data cutoff (Jan 16, 2014), 13 patients remained on treatment (six on 10 mg/kg, seven on 20 mg/kg). 61 (84%) patients achieved an objective response (33 [92%] with 10 mg/kg, 28 [76%] with 20 mg/kg); 31 (42%) a very good partial response (17 [47%] with 10 mg/kg, 14 [38%] with 20 mg/kg); and 20 (27%) a partial response (10 [28%] with 10 mg/kg, 10 [27%] with 20 mg/kg). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were diarrhoea (48 [66%]), muscle spasms (45 [62%]), and fatigue (41 [56%]). 57 (78%) patients had grade 3-4 events, the most common of which were lymphopenia (15 [21%]) and neutropenia (14 [19%]). Three deaths occurred, none related to the study drugs. INTERPRETATION: Elotuzumab combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma showed acceptable safety and efficacy that seems better than that previously noted with lenalidomide and dexamethasone only.

The current study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of hepatocyte transdifferentiation in vitro. Rat hepatocytes were cultured in roller bottles to obtain hepatocyte organoid cultures, which were stimulated with various growth factors (GFs) including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), stem cell factor (SCF), macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), fibroblast growth factor-a (FGF-a), fibroblast growth factor-b (FGF-b), and fibroblast growth factor-8b (FGF-8b). Only the cultures treated with HGF, EGF, and their combination exhibited formation of hepatocyte-derived biliary epithelium (BE) despite the presence and activation of all the pertinent cognate membrane receptors of the rest of the GFs. Microarray analysis of the organoid cultures identified specific up-regulation of approximately 500 target genes induced by HGF and EGF, including members of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein family, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, and CXC (cysteine-any amino acid-cysteine) chemokines. To investigate the downstream signaling involved in hepatocyte to biliary epithelial cell (BEC) transdifferentiation, we investigated expression and activities of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)] as well as serine/threonine kinase AKT. The analysis indicated that AKT phosphorylation was particularly increased in cultures treated with HGF, EGF, and their combination. Whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 completely inhibited biliary epithelium formation, AKT inhibitor could only moderately reduce formation of BE in the organoid cultures treated with HGF+EGF. Most of the HGF+EGF target genes were altered by LY294002. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data indicate that hepatocyte to BE transdifferentiation is regulated by HGF and EGF receptors and that PI3 kinase-mediated signaling independent of AKT is a crucial component of the transdifferentiation process.",0
2059,431682,A new design for randomized clinical trials,"This paper proposes a new method for planning randomized clinical trials. This method is especially suited to comparison of a best standard or control treatment with an experimental treatment. Patients are allocated into two groups by a random or chance mechanism. Patients in the first group receive standard treatment; those in the second group are asked if they will accept the experimental therapy; if they decline, they receive the best standard treatment. In the analyses of results, all those in the second group, regardless of treatment, are compared with those in the first group. Any loss of statistical efficiency can be overcome by increased numbers. This experimental plan is indeed a randomized clinical trial and has the advantage that, before providing consent, a patient will know whether an experimental treatment is to be used.",0
2060,2830514,Social and economic factors in the choice of lung cancer treatment. A population-based study in two rural states,"We reviewed 1808 hospital charts representing virtually all patients given a diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer in New Hampshire and Vermont between 1973 and 1976 and found that the treatment of patients varied according to their marital status, medical insurance coverage, and proximity to a cancer-treatment center. Patients were more likely to be treated with surgery if they were married (odds ratio, 1.67; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.57) or had private medical insurance (1.52; 1.03 to 2.26). Among patients who did not have surgery, those with private insurance were more likely to receive another form of anticancer therapy--either radiation or chemotherapy (1.57; 1.18 to 2.09). Residing farther from a cancer-treatment center was associated with a greater chance of having surgery. Patients 75 years of age and older were less likely to have surgery (0.16; 0.08 to 0.35) or any other tumor-directed therapy (0.32; 0.19 to 0.54). The relation between the type of treatment and a patient's characteristics was not based on apparent differences in tumor stage or functional status, although both these factors were also strongly predictive of the type of treatment. Despite the fact that privately insured and married patients were more aggressively treated, they did not survive longer after diagnosis. We conclude that for non-small-cell lung cancer, socio-economic as well as medical factors determine treatment.",0

The HMCs were divided into the following groups: 1 normal glucose group (NG), high glucose group (HG), osmotic control group (LG), normal glucose+bovine serum albumin group (BSA), normal glucose+AGEs group (AGEs); 2 high glucose+empty vector group (HN), high glucose+PKCβ2 group (PO), high glucose+PKCβ2 inhibitor CGP53353 group (PI), AGEs+empty vector group (AN), AGEs+PKCβ2 group (APO), AGEs+PKCβ2 inhibitor CGP53353 group (API); 3 normal glucose+p300 inhibitor garcinol group (NG+Gar), high glucose+garcinol group (HG+Gar), BSA+garcinol group (BSA+Gar), and AGEs+garcinol group (AGEs+Gar). All cells in each group were cultured for 2 d. ROS levels were measured by fluorescence microscope and fluorescence microplate reader. The protein expressions of p300, PKCβ2 and fibronectin were detected by Western blotting. Levels of p300, PKCβ2 and ROS in HG and AGEs groups were elevated by 1.04, 1.26, 0.78 and 1.45, 1.07, 0.71 folds of those in NG group and BSA control group, respectively (P<0.05). However, ROS levels in HG+Gar and AGEs+Gar groups decreased significantly to 0.43 and 0.39 folds of those in HG and AGEs groups, respectively (P<0.05). p300 and PKCβ2 protein expressions in PO and APO groups were up-regulated by 1.19, 1.73 and 1.23, 1.69 folds compared with HG and AGEs groups, respectively (P<0.05). However, in the present of CGP53353, both p300 and PKCβ2 decreased significantly (P<0.05); the two factors stayed stable in HN and AN groups as compared with HG and AGEs groups.

2065,22850321,Temozolomide-related idiosyncratic and other uncommon toxicities: a systematic review,"Temozolomide (TMZ)-related idiosyncratic and other uncommon toxicities have been reported. To better characterize these toxicities and to identify any associated risk factors, we performed a systematic review. We searched the PubMed database, limited to the English language, published between 1999 and December 2011. We selected only those articles in which TMZ was temporally related and was the sole or main contributing chemotherapeutic drug to idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs) and other uncommon toxicities. Hematological IDRs are biopsy-proven aplastic anemia or grade V toxicity or grade IV toxicity with slow and incomplete hematological recovery. Seventy-three cases were identified, including 21 hematological IDRs, 31 nonhematological IDRs and uncommon infections, and 21 second primary cancers. With a caveat of publication and reporting bias, the following observations could be made. The hematological IDRs predominantly occurred in female patients (exact binomial two-tailed, P=0.0041) and most patients were receiving TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy for glioma. The median duration of exposure to TMZ was 30 days and the median cumulative TMZ exposure was 2250 mg/m (range, 500-6900 mg/m). The sex predilection was not evident in nonhematological IDRs and other uncommon toxicities. TMZ-induced pneumonitis and cholestatic hepatitis are emerging as a nonhematological hypersensitive reaction and IDR, respectively. For TMZ-related myelodysplasia or leukemia, the cumulative dose of TMZ ranged from 1400 to 30 000 mg/m. The cumulative dose of TMZ was lower and latency was shorter with a previous exposure to other leukemogenic drugs, suggesting that TMZ may have augmented the leukemogenic potential of other drugs. Early appearance of profound myelosuppression during the course of TMZ and concurrent radiotherapy could be a hematological IDR, which warrants prompt investigations to exclude aplastic anemia. Myelodysplasia or leukemia developed after a median TMZ exposure of 15 g/m.",1

2067,8845864,"Interaction of human liver cytochromes P450 in vitro with LY307640, a gastric proton pump inhibitor","The interactions in vitro of LY307640 with the cytochromes P450 (P450s) were studied using human liver microsomes, specific inhibitors of the P450s, and cDNA expressed enzymes. The kinetics of formation of the two major oxidative metabolites, desmethyl LY307640 and LY307640 sulfone, were determined using two human liver microsomal samples. The kinetic data indicated that high and low affinity sites were present for the production of both metabolites of LY307640. The Km(apparent) and Vmax(apparent) for desmethyl LY307640 formation by microsomes from human liver E (HL-E) for the high affinity site were 18.8 +/- 4.4 microM and 402 +/- 52 pmol product/min/mg protein. The high affinity site Km(apparent) and Vmax(apparent) for LY307640 sulfone formation by microsomes from HL-E were 4.4 +/- 2.1 microM and 81.8 +/- 18 pmol product/min/mg protein. The rates of desmethyl LY307640 and LY307640 sulfone formation by the high affinity site were determined using 14 human liver microsomal samples characterized for P450 marker catalytic activities and immunoquantified levels of the P450s. Rates of formation of desmethyl LY307640 significantly correlated with the immunoquantified levels of CYP 2C19 and the ability of the microsomes to 4'-hydroxylate S-mephenytoin. LY307640 sulfone formation significantly correlated with the immunoquantified levels of CYP 3A and the ability of the microsomes to 1'-hydroxylate midazolam. Inhibition studies and use of expressed cytochrome P450 systems confirmed the correlation data demonstrating that CYP 2C19 catalyzed the formation of desmethyl LY307640 and CYP 3A and catalyzed LY307640 sulfone formation. Further, LY307640 competitively inhibited S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation as did the structurally related compound, omeprazole. For the inhibition of S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, LY307640 had higher Ki(apparent) values than that of omeprazole. These studies demonstrate that the high affinity enzymes which catalyze the formation of the desmethyl and sulfone metabolites of LY307640 are, respectively, CYP 2C19 and CYP 3A. In addition, the inhibition data suggest that LY307640 has less potential to inhibit the metabolism of CYP 2C19 substrates compared to omeprazole, and that LY307640 and omeprazole have a similarly low potential to inhibit the metabolism of CYP 3A substrates.

DATA SOURCES: Articles indexed in PubMed (1948-August 2013), TOXLINE (2001-August 2013), and Google Scholar as well as meeting abstracts were identified using the search terms ziv-aflibercept and colorectal cancer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English-language articles DATA SYNTHESIS: Ziv-aflibercept, a selective vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, was evaluated as monotherapy for treatment of mCRC in a phase 2 study and added to FOLFIRI in a phase 3 trial. Patient response to ziv-aflibercept as monotherapy did not reach statistical significance. Results suggest that response to ziv-aflibercept treatment is not influenced by prior bevacizumab therapy. A phase 3 trial compared the safety and efficacy of ziv-aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC who experienced disease progression on an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Patients in the ziv-aflibercept arm had a median overall survival of 13.5 months, versus 12.06 months for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.817, 95% CI = 0.713 to 0.937). Progression-free survival for patients receiving ziv-aflibercept was higher compared with placebo (HR = 0.758; 95% CI = 0.661 to 0.869). The most common adverse effects observed were anemia, diarrhea, and neutropenia.

2070,1738376,Nosocomial transmission of hepatitis B virus associated with the use of a spring-loaded finger-stick device,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: From June 1989 through March 1990, 26 patients, of whom 23 had diabetes, contracted acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a hospital in California. All 26 patients and one HBV carrier (also a diabetic) had been admitted to a single medical ward during the six months before the case patients became infected with HBV. To determine the source of the infection, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 72 patients with diabetes who had been admitted to the ward from January through December 1989 and a case-control study comparing the 3 nondiabetic patients who contracted hepatitis with 20 nondiabetic controls. RESULTS: The retrospective cohort study of all the patients with diabetes who were admitted to the ward during 1989 found that those who underwent capillary blood sampling by finger stick with a spring-loaded lancet device were more likely to contract HBV infection than those who did not have finger sticks (attack rate, 42 percent vs. 0 percent; P = 0.08). In addition, a dose-response relation was observed between the number of finger sticks received and the frequency of hepatitis B (P = 0.002). The case-control study found that all 3 of the nondiabetic patients who contracted hepatitis underwent finger-stick blood sampling with the device, as compared with none of the 20 nondiabetic controls (P = 0.0006). A review of nursing procedures indicated that the platform of the device was not routinely changed after each use; this finding suggested that contamination of the platform by HBV-infected blood was the mechanism of percutaneous transmission of HBV. CONCLUSIONS: Proper use of finger-stick devices as well as strict adherence to universal precautions to avoid contamination by blood are required to decrease the possibility of transmission of blood-borne pathogens among hospitalized patients.",0

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the use of contact X-ray brachytherapy within this paradigm. All patients had undergone local excision and were referred to our radiotherapy centre for treatment with contact X-ray brachytherapy. Postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy was also given in their local hospital in most cases. Variables assessed were local excision method, postoperative therapy received, follow-up duration, disease-free survival, salvage surgery and stoma-free survival. In total, 180 patients with a median age of 70 (range 36-99) years were assessed. Following local excision, pT stages were pT1 = 131 (72%), pT2 = 44 (26%), pT3 = 5 (2%). All patients received contact X-ray brachytherapy boosting at our centre and, in addition, 110 received chemoradiotherapy and 60 received radiotherapy alone. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range 6-48), 169 patients (94%) remained free of local recurrence. Of the 11 patients with local recurrence (three isolated nodal), five underwent salvage abdominoperineal excision. Eight patients developed distant disease, of whom five underwent metastasis surgery. At last included follow-up 173 (96%) patients were free of all disease and 170 (94%) were stoma free. Contact therapy can be offered in addition to external beam radio (±chemo) therapy instead of radical surgery as follow-on treatment after local excision of early rectal cancer. This combination can provide equivalent outcomes to radical surgery. The added value of contact therapy should be formally assessed in a clinical trial. ",0

Hepatitis A and B were confirmed in 7.5 and 35% patients, respectively, by IgM antibodies. Epidemiologic evidence suggested the possibility of non-A, non-B hepatitis in at least a few of the remaining 23 children. Hepatitis B was seen more often in children with severe tubercular disease (72%) and was largely (92.8%) parenterally transmitted. The study highlights that the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries, among other factors, could also be responsible for the reported higher incidence of hepatotoxicity from developing countries and also for the increased risk of hepatotoxicity seen in severe tubercular disease.",1

METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 423 previously untreated patients who had unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation to receive a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or dabrafenib and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, response rate, response duration, and safety. A preplanned interim overall survival analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 8.8 months in the dabrafenib-only group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.99; P=0.03). The overall response rate was 67% in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 51% in the dabrafenib-only group (P=0.002). At 6 months, the interim overall survival rate was 93% with dabrafenib-trametinib and 85% with dabrafenib alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.94; P=0.02). However, a specified efficacy-stopping boundary (two-sided P=0.00028) was not crossed. Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups, although more dose modifications occurred in the dabrafenib-trametinib group. The rate of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was lower in the dabrafenib-trametinib group than in the dabrafenib-only group (2% vs. 9%), whereas pyrexia occurred in more patients (51% vs. 28%) and was more often severe (grade 3, 6% vs. 2%) in the dabrafenib-trametinib group. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, as compared with dabrafenib alone, improved the rate of progression-free survival in previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Described in association with medications, autoimmune disorders, cancer, transplantation, and infections, the specific mechanisms of disease are not known. To date, only 4 cases of VBDS have been reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. We report 2 additional cases of HIV-associated VBDS and review the features common to the HIV-associated cases. Presentation includes hyperbilirubinemia, normal liver imaging, and negative viral and autoimmune hepatitis studies. In HIV-infected subjects, VBDS occurred at a range of CD4+ T-cell counts, in some cases following initiation or change in antiretroviral therapy. Lymphoma was associated with two cases; nevirapine, antibiotics, and viral co-infection were suggested as etiologies in the other cases. In HIV-positive patients with progressive cholestasis, early identification of VBDS and referral for transplantation may improve outcomes.""",1
2082,25587454,"Differences in the malariometric indices of asymptomatic carriers in three communities in ibadan, Nigeria","This study was conducted to determine the malariometric indices of children in three different settings in Ibadan, Nigeria. Children were recruited from an urban slum (Oloomi) and a periurban (Sasa) and a rural community (Igbanda) in Ibadan. Children aged between 2 and 10 years were randomly selected from primary schools in the urban and periurban areas. In the rural community, children were recruited from the centre of the village. A total of 670 (55.0%) out of 1218 children recruited were positive for malaria parasitaemia. The urban population had the highest proportion of children with malaria parasitaemia. Splenomegaly was present in 31.5%, hepatomegaly in 41.5%, hepatosplenomegaly in 27.5%, and anaemia in 25.2% of the children. The parasite density was not significantly different among children in the three communities. Children in the rural community had the highest mean PCV of 34.2% and the lowest rates of splenomegaly (6.1%), hepatomegaly (7.6%), and hepatosplenomegaly (4.6%). The spleen rates, liver rates, and presence of hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia were similar in the urban and periurban communities. The malariometric indices among the asymptomatic carriers were high, especially in the urban slum. This stresses the need for intensified efforts at controlling the disease in the study area.  ",0
2083,29898479,Is irritable bowel syndrome also present in dogs?,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in humans is described as the recurrent presence of gastrointestinal signs, without gross histopathologic evidence of inflammation and of other morphologic lesions; however, it is a syndrome not unanimously defined in veterinary medicine. There is some evidence that dysmotility could be related to stressors in some dogs that present with clinical signs (e.g. chronic idiopathic large-bowel diarrhea) that share overlapping aspects with human IBS. The authors hypothesize that an IBS-like condition, similar to that described in humans, might also be present in dogs. Nevertheless, the diagnostic path for canine IBS needs to be further elucidated and its pathogenesis better defined for a more rational therapeutic approach. In der Humanmedizin beschreibt der Begriff Reizdarmsyndrom das Auftreten wiederkehrender gastrointestinaler Symptome ohne ausgeprägte entzündliche oder andere morphologische Veränderungen in Darmbioptaten. In der Veterinärmedizin ist dieses Syndrom nicht einheitlich definiert. Es gibt jedoch Hinweise, dass bei Hunden Motilitätsstörungen des Magen-Darm-Trakts aufgrund verschiedener Stressfaktoren zu klinischen Symptomen (z. B. chronische idiopathische Dickdarmdiarrhö) führen, die in einigen Aspekten dem Reizdarmsyndrom des Menschen entsprechen.

The present study was designed to evaluate their long-term functional stability and their response to repeated daily drug treatments over a 14-day period, using a transcriptomic approach. Our data show that less than 1% of the expressed genes were markedly deregulated over this two weeks period and mainly included down-regulation of genes related to the cell cycle and from 3 days, overexpression of genes involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism. After daily treatment with the three PPAR agonists, fenofibrate, troglitazone and rosiglitazone qualitative and/or quantitative changes in gene profiling were observed depending on the compound and duration of treatment. The highest increase in the number of deregulated genes as a function of drug treatment was seen with rosiglitazone. The most up-regulated genes common across the three compounds were mainly related to lipid and xenobiotic metabolisms. All the data support the conclusion that human HepaRG cells have an exceptional functional stability at confluence and that they are suitable for investigations on chronic effects of drugs and other chemicals.

Skin rash began after 2 weeks of treatment, and signs of hepatocellular failure developed 3 weeks after phenobarbital had been started. Signs of severe liver disease included elevated aminotransferases, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, significant coagulopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. Other features of this adverse drug reaction were unremitting fever, leukocytosis with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis, and proteinuria. Sepsis, viral hepatitis, and metabolic liver disease were excluded. The child was on no other medication and had been previously well. In-vitro rechallenge of the patient's lymphocytes with cytochrome P-450 generated metabolites of phenobarbital showed extensive cytotoxicity compared to control. These data support the hypothesis that a defect in drug detoxification was responsible for the child's susceptibility to this drug hepatotoxicity.",1

All had dyspnea, edema, elevated pulmonary wedge pressure (28.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg), low cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.1 liters per minute per square meter), and elevated levels of serum creatinine (2.3 +/- 0.2 mg per deciliter [203.3 +/- 17.7 mumol per liter]), blood urea nitrogen (48 +/- 5 mg per deciliter [17.1 +/- 1.8 mmol of urea per liter]), plasma renin activity (21 +/- 7 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour), plasma angiotensin II (271 +/- 51 pg per milliliter), and plasma aldosterone (65 +/- 14 ng per deciliter). After one week of therapy, all indexes improved. Creatinine and p-aminohippurate clearances were also increased (P less than 0.01). Improvement was sustained (more than six months) and was associated with a statistically significant increase in the cardiac ejection fraction (12 +/- 3 to 26 +/- 7 per cent). With a mean follow-up of seven months, the New York Heart Association Functional Class has been reduced from IV to II, and the number of days of hospitalization to less than 10 per cent of that before captopril therapy. We conclude that captopril reduces afterload in advanced congestive heart failure and induces sustained improvements in clinical status and renal function.",0
2089,18403759,"Effect of variation in CHI3L1 on serum YKL-40 level, risk of asthma, and lung function","BACKGROUND: The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling. We recently showed that serum YKL-40 levels were elevated in patients with asthma and were correlated with severity, thickening of the subepithelial basement membrane, and pulmonary function. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect YKL-40 levels also influence asthma status and lung function. METHODS: We carried out a genomewide association study of serum YKL-40 levels in a founder population of European descent, the Hutterites, and then tested for an association between an implicated SNP and asthma and lung function. One associated variant was genotyped in a birth cohort at high risk for asthma, in which YKL-40 levels were measured from birth through 5 years of age, and in two populations of unrelated case patients of European descent with asthma and controls. RESULTS: A promoter SNP (-131C-->G) in CHI3L1, the chitinase 3-like 1 gene encoding YKL-40, was associated with elevated serum YKL-40 levels (P=1.1 x 10(-13)), asthma (P=0.047), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (P=0.002), and measures of pulmonary function (P=0.046 to 0.002) in the Hutterites. The same SNP could be used to predict the presence of asthma in the two case-control populations (combined P=1.2 x 10(-5)) and serum YKL-40 levels at birth (in cord-blood specimens) through 5 years of age in the birth cohort (P=8.9 x 10(-3) to 2.5 x 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: CHI3L1 is a susceptibility gene for asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and reduced lung function, and elevated circulating YKL-40 levels are a biomarker for asthma and decline in lung function.",0

This is the second report of the R240C mutation in association with isolated EL, and supports the existing evidence that the R240C mutation can result in two quite distinct, yet related, phenotypes. It also raises the possibility that R240C may prove to be a relative mutational """"hot-spot"""" for isolated EL.

2091,18547415,Safety and tolerability of combination antimalarial therapies for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Ugandan children,"""BACKGROUND: Combination antimalarial therapy is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Africa; however, some concerns about the safety and tolerability of new regimens remain. This study compared the safety and tolerability of three combination antimalarial regimens in a cohort of Ugandan children. METHODS: A longitudinal, single-blind, randomized clinical trial of children was conducted between November 2004 and May 2007 in Kampala, Uganda. Upon diagnosis of the first episode of uncomplicated malaria, participants were randomized to treatment with amodiaquine + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP), artesunate + amodiaquine (AS+AQ), or artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Once randomized, participants received the same regimen for all subsequent episodes of uncomplicated malaria. Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for the first 14 days after each treatment, and then passively followed until their next study medication treatment, or withdrawal from study. Outcome measures included the risk of adverse events at 14 and 42 days after treatment. RESULTS: Of 601 enrolled children, 382 were diagnosed with at least one episode of uncomplicated malaria and were treated with study medications. The median age at treatment was 6.3 years (range 1.1 - 12.3 years). At 14 days of follow-up, AQ+SP treatment was associated with a higher risk of anorexia, weakness, and subjective fever than treatment with AL, and a higher risk of weakness, and subjective fever than treatment with AS+AQ. Treatment with AL was associated with a higher risk of elevated temperature. Repeated episodes of neutropaenia associated with AS+AQ were detected in one participant. Considering only children less than five years, those who received AQ+SP were at higher risk of developing moderate or severe anorexia and weakness than those treated with AL (anorexia: RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.59 - 9.17; weakness: RR 5.40, 95% CI 1.86 - 15.7), or AS+AQ (anorexia: RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.04 - 4.23; weakness: RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.01 - 5.05). Extending the analysis to 42 days of follow-up had little impact on the findings. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the safety and tolerability of AS+AQ and AL in Ugandan children, and suggests that AQ+SP is safe, but less well-tolerated, particularly in younger children. As newer antimalarial regimens are deployed, collecting data on their safety and tolerability will be essential. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials Identifier ISRCTN37517549.""",1
2092,22808112,Liver enzyme abnormalities and associated risk factors in HIV patients on efavirenz-based HAART with or without tuberculosis co-infection in Tanzania,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the timing, incidence, clinical presentation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetic predictors for antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drug induced liver injury (DILI) in HIV patients with or without TB co-infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 473 treatment naive HIV patients (253 HIV only and 220 with HIV-TB co-infection) were enrolled prospectively. Plasma efavirenz concentration and CYP2B6*6, CYP3A5*3, *6 and *7, ABCB1 3435C/T and SLCO1B1 genotypes were determined. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and up to 48 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. DILI case definition was according to Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). Incidence of DILI and identification of predictors was evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards Model. The overall incidence of DILI was 7.8% (8.3 per 1000 person-week), being non-significantly higher among patients receiving concomitant anti-TB and HAART (10.0%, 10.7 per 1000 person-week) than those receiving HAART alone (5.9%, 6.3 per 1000 person-week). Frequency of CYP2B6*6 allele (p = 0.03) and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype (p = 0.06) was significantly higher in patients with DILI than those without. Multivariate cox regression model indicated that CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype and anti-HCV IgG antibody positive as significant predictors of DILI. Median time to DILI was 2 weeks after HAART initiation and no DILI onset was observed after 12 weeks. No severe DILI was seen and the gain in CD4 was similar in patients with or without DILI. CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis DILI does occur in our setting, presenting early following HAART initiation. DILI seen is mild, transient and may not require treatment interruption. There is good tolerance to HAART and anti-TB with similar immunological outcomes. Genetic make-up mainly CYP2B6 genotype influences the development of efavirenz based HAART liver injury in Tanzanians.",1
2093,17072088,Metabolic and non-metabolic factors determining troglitazone hepatotoxicity: a review,"Troglitazone (TGZ), a thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agent, causes serious idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. TGZ is metabolized into reactive metabolites that covalently bind to cellular macromolecules, one of which is oxidation at the chromane ring, a unique structure of TGZ, and another involves oxidative cleavage of the thiazolidinedione ring, a structure common to less hepatotoxic antidiabetics, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. TGZ is cytotoxic to HepG2 cells and rat and human hepatocytes. However, the role of the reactive metabolite on the TGZ toxicity is controversial, because there was no correlation of the generation of the reactive metabolites with susceptibility to the TGZ cytotoxicity, and chemical inhibitors of drug metabolizing enzymes could not protect the cells against the toxicity. Mitochondrial dysfunction, especially mitochondrial permeability transition, may be a pathophysiological event, which is mediated by TGZ itself and is a major non-metabolic factor. Other events such as apoptosis and PPARgamma-dependent steatosis could be also mediated by TGZ, while inhibition of bile salt export pump, a cause of TGZ-induced cholestasis, may be caused by the TGZ sulfate. In conclusion, although the TGZ is biotransformed into chemically reactive metabolites, there is currently no potential evidence for involvement of the reactive metabolite in the TGZ-induced liver injury.",1

In poultry the metabolic and endocrine responses to beta(2)-agonists are not fully elucidated. In this trial the effects of dietary clenbuterol (1 p.p.m.) and cimaterol (1 p.p.m.) on muscle composition and endocrine response of male broiler chickens were studied. Dietary clenbuterol induced a slight, but in general not significant, improvement of zootechnical performances and carcass yields. Chemical composition of muscle was not influenced by dietary treatments, even if a slight improvement of protein content was observed in treated groups. No effects on fatty acid composition of meat were detected. Both clenbuterol and cimaterol treatments caused a downregulation in testicular androgen receptors and in pulmonary, cardiac and central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors. ",0

The most effective dose regimen remains controversial. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of IFNbeta-1a (Rebif) 44 micro g subcutaneously three times weekly (tiw), and IFNbeta-1a (Avonex) 30 micro g IM once weekly (qw) in 677 patients with RRMS. Assessors blinded to treatment performed neurologic and MRI evaluations. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were relapse free at 24 weeks; the principal MRI endpoint was the number of active lesions per patient per scan at 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 24 weeks, 74.9% (254/339) of patients receiving IFNbeta-1a 44 micro g tiw remained relapse free compared with 63.3% (214/338) of those given 30 micro g qw. The odds ratio for remaining relapse free was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.6; p = 0.0005) at 24 weeks and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1; p = 0.009) at 48 weeks, favoring 44 micro g tiw. Patients receiving 44 micro g tiw had fewer active MRI lesions (p < 0.001 at 24 and 48 weeks) compared with those receiving 30 micro g qw. Injection-site reactions were more frequent with 44 micro g tiw (83% vs 28%, p < 0.001), as were asymptomatic abnormalities of liver enzymes (18% vs 9%, p = 0.002) and altered leukocyte counts (11% vs 5%, p = 0.003) compared with the 30 micro g qw dosage. Neutralizing antibodies developed in 25% of 44 micro g tiw patients and in 2% of patients receiving 30 micro g qw.

2097,2034245,Sensitivity to triazolam in the elderly,"BACKGROUND: Elderly persons frequently appear to be sensitive to the effects of many drugs that depress the central nervous system. We studied the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the benzodiazepine hypnotic agent triazolam, now the most frequently prescribed hypnotic drug in the United States. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy young subjects (mean age, 30 years) and 21 healthy elderly subjects (mean age, 69 years) participated in a four-way crossover study. After a single-blind adaptation trial with placebo, each subject received, in random order and in double-blind fashion, single doses of placebo, 0.125 mg of triazolam, and 0.25 mg of triazolam. For 24 hours after the administration of each of the three study medications, plasma triazolam levels were determined and psychomotor performance, memory, and degree of sedation were assessed. RESULTS: Plasma triazolam concentrations increased in proportion to the dose, but the elderly subjects had higher plasma concentrations due to reduced clearance of the drug. The degree of sedation as rated by an observer and the reduction in the subjects' performance on the digit-symbol substitution test were both greater in the elderly than in the young subjects after they were given the same doses. The relation of the plasma triazolam concentration to the degree of impairment was similar for the two groups. As part of the study, information was presented 1 1/2 hours after the administration of the drugs; the subjects' ability to recall the information 24 hours later was impaired by both doses of triazolam, and the percent decrease was similar in the young and elderly groups. CONCLUSIONS: Triazolam caused a greater degree of sedation and greater impairment of psychomotor performance in healthy elderly persons than in young persons who received the same dose. These effects resulted from reduced clearance and higher plasma concentrations of triazolam rather than from an increased intrinsic sensitivity to the drug. On the basis of these results, the dosage of triazolam for elderly persons should be reduced on average by 50 percent.",0
2098,23851054,Waterborne exposure of zebrafish embryos to micromole concentrations of ioxynil and diethylstilbestrol disrupts thyrocyte development,"The herbicide ioxynil (IOX) and synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) are common aquatic contaminants with an endocrine disrupting action. In juvenile teleost fish IOX and DES disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. To assess how IOX and DES influence the developing HPT axis prior to establishment of central regulation of thyroid hormones, zebrafish embryos were exposed to low concentrations of the chemicals in water. IOX and DES (1 and 0.1 μM) exposure failed to modify hypothalamic development but had a negative effect on thyrocyte development. Specifically, IOX and DES caused a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the size of the thyroid anlagen by decreasing the mRNA expression field of both nk2.1a and thyroglobulin (Tg) genes. Inhibition of thyroid gland development by IOX and DES (0.1 μM) was strongly associated with altered heart morphology. To test if the effect of IOX and DES on the thyroid was a consequence of altered cardiac development a morpholino (MO) against zebrafish cardiac troponin I (zcTnI) was microinjected. The zcTnI morphants had modified heart function, a small thyroid anlagen and a reduction in the mRNA expression of nk2.1a and Tg genes similar to that of zebrafish exposed to IOX (1 and 0.1 μM) and DES (0.1 μM). Collectively the data indicate that IOX and DES alter thyroid development in zebrafish and chemicals that alter heart development and function can have an indirect endocrine disrupting action on the thyroid in teleosts.

HPS2-THRIVE is a large randomized trial assessing the effects of extended release (ER) niacin in patients at high risk of vascular events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prior to randomization, 42 424 patients with occlusive arterial disease were given simvastatin 40 mg plus, if required, ezetimibe 10 mg daily to standardize their low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy. The ability to remain compliant with ER niacin 2 g plus laropiprant 40 mg daily (ERN/LRPT) for ~1 month was then assessed in 38 369 patients and about one-third were excluded (mainly due to niacin side effects). A total of 25 673 patients were randomized between ERN/LRPT daily vs. placebo and were followed for a median of 3.9 years. By the end of the study, 25% of participants allocated ERN/LRPT vs. 17% allocated placebo had stopped their study treatment. The most common medical reasons for stopping ERN/LRPT were related to skin, gastrointestinal, diabetes, and musculoskeletal side effects. When added to statin-based LDL-lowering therapy, allocation to ERN/LRPT increased the risk of definite myopathy [75 (0.16%/year) vs. 17 (0.04%/year): risk ratio 4.4; 95% CI 2.6-7.5; P < 0.0001]; 7 vs. 5 were rhabdomyolysis. Any myopathy (definite or incipient) was more common among participants in China [138 (0.66%/year) vs. 27 (0.13%/year)] than among those in Europe [17 (0.07%/year) vs. 11 (0.04%/year)]. Consecutive alanine transaminase >3x upper limit of normal, in the absence of muscle damage, was seen in 48 (0.10%/year) ERN/LRPT vs. 30 (0.06%/year) placebo allocated participants. CONCLUSION: The risk of myopathy was increased by adding ERN/LRPT to simvastatin 40 mg daily (with or without ezetimibe), particularly in Chinese patients whose myopathy rates on simvastatin were higher. Despite the side effects of ERN/LRPT, among individuals who were able to tolerate it for ~1 month, three-quarters continued to take it for ~4 years.""",1

Therefore, the authors examined the incidence, outcomes, and predictive factors of vancomycin-associated toxicities in general oncology practice with the goal of developing clinically relevant prediction rules and guidelines. METHODS: All 742 consecutive cancer patients who received vancomycin at a comprehensive cancer center during a 3-month period were followed prospectively for the development and outcome of phlebitis, rash, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Logistic regression was used to derive a multiple variable model of the risk of nephrotoxicity. A clinical prediction rule, the Nephrotoxicity Risk Score, was developed from the risk model and validated prospectively. RESULTS: Phlebitis occurred in 3% of patients (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2-4%), predominantly those with recently inserted central venous catheters. Rashes occurred in 11% of patients (95% CI, 9-13%); however, all but 4 patients also were receiving beta-lactam antibiotics. Clinical evidence of ototoxicity developed in 6% of patients (95% CI, 4-9%) who were receiving vancomycin plus other ototoxic agents and only 3% of patients (95% CI, 2-5%) not receiving other ototoxic agents (P = 0.08). Nephrotoxicity occurred in 17% of patients (95% CI, 15-20%). Logistic regression revealed that factors associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity included administration of other mild to moderate (P = 0.01) or severely nephrotoxic agents (P < 0.001) or an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) score > 40 (P = 0.002). Elevated serum vancomycin peak levels did not reliably predict subsequent nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin-associated toxicities usually are mild and self-limiting. Some patients are at a significantly higher risk of nephrotoxicity but the authors believe these individuals can be identified reliably with the Nephrotoxicity Risk Index using information available at vancomycin initiation. Further testing of the Nephrotoxicity Risk Index is ongoing.""",1

2104,22583335,Efficacy and safety of the interleukin-1 antagonist rilonacept in Schnitzler syndrome: an open-label study,"BACKGROUND: Schnitzler syndrome (SchS) is a rare disease with suspected autoinflammatory background that shares several clinical symptoms, including urticarial rash, fever episodes, arthralgia, and bone and muscle pain with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes respond to treatment with interleukin-1 antagonists, and single case reports of Schnitzler syndrome have shown improvement following treatment with the interleukin-1 blocker anakinra. This study evaluated the effects of the interleukin-1 antagonist rilonacept on the clinical signs and symptoms of SchS. METHODS: Eight patients with SchS were included in this prospective, single-center, open-label study. After a 3-week baseline, patients received a subcutaneous loading dose of rilonacept 320 mg followed by weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 1 year. Efficacy was determined by patient-based daily health assessment forms, physician's global assessment (PGA), and measurement of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and S100 calcium-binding protein A12 (S100A12). RESULTS: Treatment with rilonacept resulted in a rapid clinical response as demonstrated by significant reductions in daily health assessment scores and PGA scores compared with baseline levels (P < 0.05). These effects, which were accompanied by reductions in CRP and SAA, continued over the treatment duration. Rilonacept treatment was well tolerated. There were no treatment-related severe adverse events and no clinically significant changes in laboratory safety parameters. CONCLUSION: Rilonacept was effective and well tolerated in patients with SchS and may represent a promising potential therapeutic option.",1
2105,10378685,Murine B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the allergen Hev b 5 from natural rubber latex,"Hev b 5, a proline-rich acidic protein with a predominantly random secondary structure, is a major allergen in natural rubber latex and a candidate for specific immunotherapy of latex allergy. As a first step in the identification of candidate peptides for immunotherapy, we have begun to identify the B-cell and T-cell epitopes of Hev b 5 in BALB/c mice. The mice were immunized with a Hev b 5 fusion protein. The B-cell epitopes were determined by the SPOTS method using overlapping octamers or by ELISA inhibition using a series of overlapping 20-mers. The T-cell epitopes were determined by the proliferation and cytokine release of splenocytes cultured in the presence of the 20-mers. Potential antibody binding regions included residues in regions 1-38, 55-74, 109-128 and 132-151. Examination of the binding sequences for common motifs suggested enhanced antibody binding to the KXEE or KEXE sequences, where X is empty, threonine or alanine. Splenocyte stimulation and cytokine release suggest T-cell epitopes with the regions 1-20, 37-56, 73-101 and 109-146. Since they may contain major T-cell epitopes but do not exhibit significant antibody binding, peptide regions 38-48 and 75-101 are candidates for specific immunotherapy to Hev b 5 in the BALB/c mouse model.

2106,10837187,Liver damage and kinetics of hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus replication during the early phases of combination antiretroviral treatment,"""In order to assess the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, CD4, CD8, and liver enzymes during combination antiretroviral therapy, these parameters were measured in 12 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients (who were naive for antiretrovirals) on the day before and 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after initiating the following treatments: stavudine and lamivudine in all patients, indinavir in 6 patients, and nevirapine in 6 patients. HIV RNA declined rapidly, CD4 cells increased slowly, and CD8 cells and liver enzymes were stable. HCV RNA showed a transient significant increase at days 14 and 21 (7.33+/-0.16 [mean +/- SE] and 7.29+/-0.2 log copies/mL vs. 7+/-0.2 log copies/mL at baseline; P<.05). These changes were similar in both treatment groups. A 2-fold alanine aminotransferase increase was observed in 4 of 12 patients; 4 of 4 patients showed increased HCV RNA. The relationship between HCV RNA increase and HIV RNA decrease indicates virus-virus interference. An HCV RNA increase may cause significant liver damage only in a minority of patients.""",1
2107,24700614,Systemic protection through remote ischemic preconditioning is spread by platelet-dependent signaling in mice,"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), the repetitive transient mechanical obstruction of vessels at a limb remote to the operative site, is a novel strategy to mitigate distant organ injury associated with surgery. In the clinic, RIPC has demonstrated efficacy in protecting various organs against ischemia reperfusion (IR), but a common mechanism underlying the systemic protection has not been identified. Here, we reasoned that protection may rely on adaptive physiological responses toward local stress, as is incurred through RIPC. Standardized mouse models of partial hepatic IR and of RIPC to the femoral vascular bundle were applied. The roles of platelets, peripheral serotonin, and circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) were studied in thrombocytopenic mice, Tph1(-) (/) (-) mice, and through neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Models of interleukin-10 (Il10) and matrix metalloproteinase 8 (Mmp8) deficiency were used to assess downstream effectors of organ protection. The protection against hepatic IR through RIPC was dependent on platelet-derived serotonin. Downstream of serotonin, systemic protection was spread through up-regulation of circulating Vegf. Both RIPC and serotonin-Vegf induced differential gene expression in target organs, with Il10 and Mmp8 displaying consistent up-regulation across all organs investigated. Concerted inhibition of both molecules abolished the protective effects of RIPC. RIPC was able to mitigate pancreatitis, indicating that it can protect beyond ischemic insults. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a platelet-serotonin-Vegf-Il10/Mmp8 axis that mediates the protective effects of RIPC. The systemic action, the conservation of RIPC effects among mice and humans, and the protection beyond ischemic insults suggest that the platelet-dependent axis has evolved as a preemptive response to local stress, priming the body against impending harm.",0
2108,19582887,Negative mood affects brain processing of visceral sensation,"A link between negative emotional state and abnormal visceral sensation has been frequently reported. However, the influence of negative emotion on brain processing of painful visceral sensations has not been investigated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and negative emotional stimuli to investigate the effects of negative emotion on brain processing of esophageal sensation. Twelve healthy male volunteers (age range, 21-32 years) participated in the study. Negative emotion was induced using emotionally valent music. fMRI images were acquired during 2 experimental runs; throughout these, volunteers received randomized nonpainful and painful distentions to the esophagus during neutral and negative emotion. Subjective perception of each stimulus was acquired, as were mood ratings. Sadness ratings increased significantly following negative mood induction (P < .01). There was no significant effect of emotion on subjective perception of painful and nonpainful stimulation (P > .05). Following painful stimulation, brain activity increased in the right hemisphere during negative emotion and was localized to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA24/32), anterior insula, and inferior frontal gyrus. Following nonpainful stimulation during negative emotion, brain activity increased in the right anterior insula and ACC (BA24 and 32). This study provides new information about the influence of negative affect on central processing of visceral pain. Evidence of right hemispheric dominance during negative emotion indicates this hemisphere is predominately associated with sympathetic activity (arousal, negative affect) and that the right insula and right ACC are integral to subjective awareness of emotion through interoception.

2109,23383366,Hepatitis B reactivation related to everolimus,"""Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) during chemotherapy is a well known complication in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cancer. The clinical manifestations range from subclinical elevation of liver enzymes to severe, potentially fatal fulminant hepatitis. Reactivation can occur in a patient with previous inactive HBV infection; either an inactive carrier or a patient with resolved hepatitis. Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor approved in renal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumours and breast cancer. mTOR inhibitors are a new generation of drugs for targeted treatment; therefore, little about their side effects is known. Here, we report a patient with renal cell carcinoma who experienced a flare of hepatitis B infection during treatment with everolimus. Clinicians should be aware of HBV reactivation in patients who are undergoing treatment with everolimus, and screening for hepatitis B infection and prophylactic antiviral treatment should be considered.""",1

2111,9882026,Review article: olestra and its gastrointestinal safety,"Olestra is a fat substitute made from sucrose and vegetable oil. Olestra is neither digested nor absorbed, and therefore adds no calories or fat to the diet. Because the gut is the only organ that is exposed to olestra, the potential for olestra to affect gastrointestinal structure and function, and the absorption of nutrients from the gut, has been investigated. Histological evaluations performed after long-term feeding studies have shown no indications that olestra causes injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Olestra is not metabolized by the colonic microflora, and has no meaningful effects on the metabolic function of these organisms. Studies of gastrointestinal transit have shown that the consumption of olestra with food does not affect gastric emptying, or small or large bowel transit times. Olestra does not affect the absorption of macronutrients, water-soluble vitamins or minerals. It causes a dose-responsive decrease in the availability of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K; however, this potentially adverse effect is offset by the addition of vitamins to olestra-containing foods. Olestra has no consistent effect on the amount of total bile acids excreted in the faeces, and therefore probably has no significant effect on bile acid absorption. The occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, loose stools, gas and abdominal cramping, after consumption of olestra under ordinary snacking conditions is comparable to that following consumption of triglyceride-containing snacks.

2112,22062945,"Herbs in epilepsy: evidence for efficacy, toxicity, and interactions","Herbs and dietary supplements enjoy widespread use in the treatment of epilepsy although supportive data yielding efficacy and safety are lacking. Ten specific products, American hellebore, betony, blue cohosh, kava, mistletoe, mugwort, pipsissiwa, skullcap, valerian, and melatonin, have either multiple-cited recommendations for use in epilepsy or a rationale for antiepileptic action and are discussed in detail. These items paradoxically often have a proconvulsant effect in addition to potentially serious adverse effects. Herb-drug interactions also occur at the level of the P450 hepatic enzyme system of drug catabolism and the P-glycoprotein transport system regulating the entry of exogenous compounds into the vasculature or blood-brain barrier. Thus, significant pharmacokinetic interactions may occur, in addition to pharmacodynamic interactions and proconvulsant effects of alternative medications themselves. Patients should be inquired as to the nature of any alternative medicine products they are using, with the view that these products may be reasonable if traditional antiepileptic drug therapy is continued, potential adverse effects of the alternative agents are monitored, and the alternative and traditional agents do not conflict.",1

2114,20872776,Tumor necrosis factor ? sensitizes primary murine hepatocytes to Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis in a Bim- and Bid-dependent manner,"Fas/CD95 is a critical mediator of cell death in many chronic and acute liver diseases and induces apoptosis in primary hepatocytes in vitro. In contrast, the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?) fails to provoke cell death in isolated hepatocytes but has been implicated in hepatocyte apoptosis during liver diseases associated with chronic inflammation. Here we report that TNF? sensitizes primary murine hepatocytes cultured on collagen to Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis. This synergism is time-dependent and is specifically mediated by TNF?. Fas itself is essential for the sensitization, but neither Fas up-regulation nor endogenous FasL is responsible for this effect. Although FasL is shown to induce Bid-independent apoptosis in hepatocytes cultured on collagen, the sensitizing effect of TNF? is clearly dependent on Bid. Moreover, both c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and Bim, another B cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only protein, are crucial mediators of TNF?-induced apoptosis sensitization. Bim and Bid activate the mitochondrial amplification loop and induce cytochrome c release, a hallmark of type II apoptosis. The mechanism of TNF?-induced sensitization is supported by a mathematical model that correctly reproduces the biological findings. Finally, our results are physiologically relevant because TNF? also induces sensitivity to agonistic anti-Fas-induced liver damage. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that TNF? can cooperate with FasL to induce hepatocyte apoptosis by activating the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bid.",0
2115,30755636,Ventricular-Subventricular Zone Contact by Glioblastoma is Not Associated with Molecular Signatures in Bulk Tumor Data,"Whether patients with glioblastoma that contacts the ventricular-subventricular zone stem cell niche (VSVZ + GBM) have a distinct survival profile from VSVZ - GBM patients independent of other known predictors or molecular profiles is unclear. Using multivariate Cox analysis to adjust survival for widely-accepted predictors, hazard ratios (HRs) for overall (OS) and progression free (PFS) survival between VSVZ + GBM and VSVZ - GBM patients were calculated in 170 single-institution patients and 254 patients included in both The Cancer Genome (TCGA) and Imaging (TCIA) atlases. An adjusted, multivariable analysis revealed that VSVZ contact was independently associated with decreased survival in both datasets. TCGA molecular data analyses revealed that VSVZ contact by GBM was independent of mutational, DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein expression signatures in the bulk tumor. Therefore, while survival of GBM patients is independently stratified by VSVZ contact, with VSVZ + GBM patients displaying a poor prognosis, the VSVZ + GBMs do not possess a distinct molecular signature at the bulk sample level. Focused examination of the interplay between the VSVZ microenvironment and subsets of GBM cells proximal to this region is warranted. ",0

One hundred and fifty patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis that had progressed or was persistently active despite treatment with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or both were randomized to receive induction cidofovir, 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 weeks, then maintenance therapy with either 5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg once every other week. Concomitant probenecid and intravenous hydration were administered with each cidofovir dose. Retinitis progression was assessed in the first 100 patients by bilateral, full-field retinal photographs read at a central reading center by an ophthalmologist masked to treatment assignment. Incidence of side effects, changes in visual acuity, and mortality were also assessed. Median time to retinitis progression as assessed by retinal photography was not reached (95% confidence interval [CI], 115 days-upper limit not reached) in the 5-mg/kg group, and was 49 days (95% CI, 35-52 days) in the 3-mg/kg group (p = .0006). Dose-dependent asymptomatic proteinuria (39%) and serum creatinine elevation (24%) were the most common adverse events thought to be related to cidofovir. Reversible probenecid reactions including constitutional symptoms and nausea occurred in 65 of 150 (43%) patients. Cidofovir therapy is effective in delaying progression of CMV retinitis that had previously progressed using other anti-CMV therapies.",1
2119,16049209,Perioperative beta-blocker therapy and mortality after major noncardiac surgery,"BACKGROUND: Despite limited evidence from randomized trials, perioperative treatment with beta-blockers is now widely advocated. We assessed the use of perioperative beta-blockers and their association with in-hospital mortality in routine clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older who underwent major noncardiac surgery in 2000 and 2001 at 329 hospitals throughout the United States. We used propensity-score matching to adjust for differences between patients who received perioperative beta-blockers and those who did not receive such therapy and compared in-hospital mortality using multivariable logistic modeling. RESULTS: Of 782,969 patients, 663,635 (85 percent) had no recorded contraindications to beta-blockers, 122,338 of whom (18 percent) received such treatment during the first two hospital days, including 14 percent of patients with a Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score of 0 and 44 percent with a score of 4 or higher. The relationship between perioperative beta-blocker treatment and the risk of death varied directly with cardiac risk; among the 580,665 patients with an RCRI score of 0 or 1, treatment was associated with no benefit and possible harm, whereas among the patients with an RCRI score of 2, 3, or 4 or more, the adjusted odds ratios for death in the hospital were 0.88 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.98), 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.80), and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.67), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative beta-blocker therapy is associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital death among high-risk, but not low-risk, patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Patient safety may be enhanced by increasing the use of beta-blockers in high-risk patients.",0
2120,6128216,Ranitidine: a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in peptic ulcer disease and other allied diseases,"Ranitidine is a new histamine H2-receptor antagonist which, unlike cimetidine, does not contain an imidazole group. On a weight basis, ranitidine is 4 to 10 times more potent than cimetidine in inhibiting stimulated gastric acid secretion in humans. Therapeutic trials comparing ranitidine and cimetidine have demonstrated that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily is an effective alternative to cimetidine 1000 mg daily in 4 divided doses in increasing the rate of healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Ranitidine, given as a single 150 mg dose at night, decreases the incidence of ulcer recurrence. Preliminary studies in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to cimetidine, indicate that ranitidine controls the gastric hyperacidity and heals most ulcers, including those which failed to respond to months of treatment with cimetidine 1 to 1.6 g daily. Ranitidine, unlike cimetidine, has no antiandrogenic effects and does not alter hepatic metabolism of drugs. Ranitidine is well tolerated. Preliminary reports of the resolution of cimetidine-induced adverse effects following substitution of ranitidine, suggest that ranitidine may be of value in patients intolerant of cimetidine. However, wider clinical experience with ranitidine is needed to determine the clinical relevance of these reports.",1
2121,21999163,Drug safety evaluation of rosuvastatin,"INTRODUCTION: Rosuvastatin is a highly efficacious statin approved for use throughout the world. Rosuvastatin has been exhaustively evaluated in the setting of a broad variety of dyslipidemias and cardiovascular disease states in clinical trials encompassed within the GALAXY program. AREAS COVERED: The efficacy and adverse event profile of rosuvastatin are evaluated based on the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials and observational studies available in the Medline database. EXPERT OPINION: Rosuvastatin is a safe and efficacious lipid modifying drug in a broad variety of patient populations (men and women, irrespective of race) for treating multiple forms of dyslipidemia. Rosuvastatin reduces atherogenic lipoproteins and triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol better than other statins. Compared to other statins, it has no excess signal for liver, skeletal muscle or renal toxicity. This is supported by evidence from both an extensive clinical trial program as well as post-marketing surveillance. The incidence of myalgia with this drug is comparable to that observed with other statins. Rosuvastatin does not depend on cytochrome P450 3A4-dependent metabolism and has a favorable drug interaction profile. Care must be taken to reduce the dose of rosuvastatin in patients of Asian ancestry or with stage IV chronic kidney disease (severe renal insufficiency), as well as patients being treated with protease inhibitors or cyclosporine.",1

The study population included 75 normal pregnant women and 28 pregnant woman with pregnant hypertension syndrome. The 24 hour urinary calcium excretion in the patients with pregnant hypertension syndrome was significantly lower (0.70 +/- 0.36 mmol/L) than that in normal pregnant women (4.00 +/- 1.90 mml/L) P < 0.0005. The 24 hour calcium excretion correlated well with the calcium to creatinine ratio of a single void morning urine sample in the two groups. We conclude that the urinary calcium excretion can be used as an indicator for pregnant hypertension syndrome. The 24 hour urinary calcium excretion can be estimated from a single void urine sample. Pregnant hypertension syndrome is associated with hypocalciuria, probably due to increased tubular reabsorption of calcium. ",0
2123,15591419,The erythropoietin receptor and its expression in tumor cells and other tissues,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, stimulating growth, preventing apoptosis, and promoting differentiation of red blood cell progenitors. The EPO receptor belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily. Although the primary role of EPO is the regulation of red blood cell production, EPO and its receptor have been localized to several nonhematopoietic tissues and cells, including the central nervous system (CNS), endothelial cells, solid tumors, the liver, and the uterus. The presence of EPO receptors and the possibility of EPO signaling in these tissues and cells have led to numerous studies of the effects of EPO at these sites. In particular, expression of EPO and the EPO receptor in cancer cells has generated much interest because of concern that administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to patients with breast and other cancer cells expressing the EPO receptor may promote tumor growth via the induction of cell proliferation or angiogenesis. However, evidence supporting a growth-promoting effect has been inconclusive. Moreover, several preclinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of EPO on delaying tumor growth. Further, it is conceivable that increased expression of EPO could reduce tumor hypoxia and ameliorate the deleterious effects of hypoxia on tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance. On the other hand, EPO has also been shown to produce an angiogenic effect in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. However, there is no evidence that these effects occur in vivo to promote tumor growth. EPO and EPO receptors are expressed in neural tissue, and they are upregulated there by hypoxia. Animal studies have shown that administration of epoetin alfa (an rHuEPO) reduces tissue injury due to ischemic stroke, blunt trauma, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings suggest that epoetin alfa may provide a therapeutic benefit in patients with stroke, trauma, epilepsy, and other CNS-related disorders. Clearly, further study of EPO and the EPO receptor in nonhematopoietic tissue is warranted to determine the potential therapeutic usefulness of rHuEPO as well as to determine the signaling pathway responsible for its effect in vivo.",1

To investigate whether a fetal pathway of bile acid synthesis exists in infancy, we measured the concentrations of bile acids in the urine, meconium and feces from normal newborns and infants by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mean ratio of total bile acids to creatinine in urine increased between birth and 7 days and then gradually decreased; however, the concentration of total bile acids in urine remained significantly higher than that in adult urine until 3 mo of age. The main urinary bile acid was CA-1 beta-ol, and substantial amounts of fetal bile acids were detected in urine until 3 mo of age. The ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid was abnormally low in meconium (mean, 0.44; range, 0.19 to 0.74), and hyocholic acid constituted 19.3% of total bile acids. The mean total bile acid content of feces decreased between birth and 7 days of age and thereafter increased. The mean percentage of fetal bile acids in feces decreased after birth, but substantial amounts were present in feces until 1 mo of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
2126,2521845,Floxuridine-associated sclerosing cholangitis. A dog model,"The authors developed a dog model for the biliary sclerosis that occurs as a severe complication of protracted hepatic arterial floxuridine (FUDR) infusions (using implanted drug delivery systems) in patients with hepatic cancers. Infusaid pumps attached to hepatic arterial catheters were used for protracted infusions in ten mixed breed hounds. To allow repeated cholangiograms, the animals' gallbladders were removed and catheters connected to subcutaneous infusion ports were positioned in the cystic ducts. Five treated dogs received FUDR 0.3 mg/kg/day through the pump for a total of 30 days. Five control dogs received only saline through the pump. Cholangiograms were obtained before and after treatment in all animals. In the control group, serum liver function test results and the cholangiographic appearance of the biliary tree remained within normal limits. By contrast, in the FUDR-treated group, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase progressively rose above normal, starting 2-3 weeks into FUDR infusion, followed by hyperbilirubinemia (7-28 mg/dl peak levels) beginning 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of the drug infusion. Cholangiograms revealed focal strictures involving the central bile ducts (five dogs) and diffuse attenuation of the intrahepatic ducts (four dogs). Thus, the liver function abnormalities and the cholangiographic findings in this dog model mimic the hepatobiliary toxicity in sensitive patients receiving similar treatment.",1

The input variables were polymer content, drug content, power of sonication and ratio of organic/aqueous phase (i.e. acetone/water), while the NPs size of PLGA-PMBH was assumed as the output variable. Forty samples of PLGA-PMBH NPs containing anticancer drug (i.e. paclitaxel) were synthesized by changing the variable factors in the experiments. The data modeling were performed using ANNs. The effects of input variables (namely, polymer content, drug content, power of sonication and ratio of acetone/water) on the output variables were evaluated using the 3D graphs obtained after modeling. Contrasting the 3D graphs from the generated model revealed that the amount of polymer (PLGA-PMBH) and drug content (PTX) have direct relation with the size of polymeric NPs in the process. In addition, it was illustrated that the ratio of acetone/water was the most important factor affecting the particle size of PLGA-PMBH NPs provided by solvent evaporation technique. Also, it was found that increasing the sonication power (up to a certain amount) indirectly affects the polymeric NPs size however it was directly affected in higher values. ",0

An investigation was carried out in 6 patients with psoriasis capitis and 6 control subjects in order to determine whether the use of Locasalen Tincture on the hairy scalp leads to percutaneous absorption of the corticosteroid and the salicylic acid. In the patients with psoriasis a few slight transient changes in biochemical-endocrinological parameters were observed, but not in the control subjects. However, these changes remained within the normal, non-pathological range so that they are of no clinical consequence. Percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid was not observed in either patient group. ",0
2131,17256764,Concanavalin A induces autophagy in hepatoma cells and has a therapeutic effect in a murine in situ hepatoma model,"Concanavalin A (ConA), a lectin with mannose specificity that can induce acute hepatic inflammation, was tested for its therapeutic effect against hepatoma. ConA is cytotoxic or inhibitory to hepatoma cells, which is mediated by the autophagic pathway through mitochondria. Once it was bound to cell membrane glycoproteins, the ConA was internalized and preferentially localized onto the mitochondria. The mitochondria membrane permeability changed, and an autophagic pathway including LC3-II generation, double-layer vesicle, BNIP3 induction, and acidic vesicular organelle formation was induced. Either 3-MA or siRNA for BNIP3 and LC3, but neither beclin-1 nor ATG 5, partially inhibited the ConA-induced cell death. In addition to the autophagy induction, ConA is known to be a T cell mitogen. Using an in situ hepatoma model, ConA can exert an anti-hepatoma therapeutic effect, inhibiting tumor nodule formation in the liver and prolonging survival. CONCLUSION: ConA can be considered as an anti-hepatoma agent therapeutically because of its autophagic induction and immunomodulating activity. This dual function of ConA provides a novel mechanism for the biological effect of lectin.",0

The VHL gene plausibly plays a key role in the initiation and tumorigenesis of both central nervous system and extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma, therefore, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms of the tumor growth are initially reviewed. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VHLD are summarized, with emphasis on the distinction of sporadic hemangioblastoma from the form fruste of VHLD (eg, hemangioblastoma-only VHLD). The world literature on the topic of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas has been comprehensively reviewed with ∼200 cases reported to date: up to 140 paraneuraxial, mostly of proximal spinal nerve roots, and 65 peripheral, 15 of soft tissue, 6 peripheral nerve, 5 bone, and 39 of internal viscera, including 26 renal and 13 nonrenal. A handful of possible yet uncertain cases from older literature are not included in this review. The clinicopathologic features of extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma are selectively presented by anatomic site of origin, and the differential diagnosis is emphasized in these subsets. Reference is made also to 10 of the authors' personal cases of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas, which include 4 paraneuraxial and 6 peripheral (2 soft tissue hemangioblastoma and 4 renal). ",0
2133,28930591,Lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular disease: current state and future directions for an enigmatic lipoprotein,"""Lipoprotein (a) (Lp (a)) is a complex polymorphic lipoprotein. Although structurally similar to low-density lipoprotein, Lp(a) has a glycoprotein, apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), attached to the apolipoprotein B-100 component. Several unique properties of Lp(a) can be attributed to the presence of apo(a). Several decades of research has improved our understanding of the structure, biochemistry, and pathophysiology of Lp(a) associated diseases. Genetic, epidemiological, and translational data indicate that elevated Lp(a) levels are likely in the causal pathway for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases as well as calcification of the aortic valves. The """"Lp(a) hypothesis,"""" unlike the """"LDL hypothesis,"""" has not been tested in clinical trials yet. Currently, the management of elevated Lp(a) is directed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

We have employed cDNA probes that are specific for the entire beta chain of the T-cell receptor, and for its constant and variable regions, to investigate gene rearrangements in T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and related disorders. In three malignant proliferations of helper (T4-positive) T cells, rearrangements of the beta-chain constant-region gene were readily demonstrated. A patient from the Caribbean who had adult T-cell lymphoma and antibody to human T-cell lymphotrophic virus Type I (HTLV-I), a patient with virus-negative chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a patient with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (S�zary variant) made up the T4-positive group. Three additional patients with chronic T8 (cytotoxic-suppressor) lymphocytosis and neutropenia were studied; in two; rearrangements were found. In all five patients with constant-region rearrangements, deletions of variable-region restriction fragments were observed as well. The presence of rearrangements of a T-cell receptor gene provides presumptive evidence for the clonal nature of T-cell proliferation and for its neoplastic character.",0

On July 12, 2016, a synthetic cannabinoid caused mass intoxication of 33 persons in one New York City neighborhood, in an event described in the popular press as a """"zombie"""" outbreak because of the appearance of the intoxicated persons. METHODS: We obtained and tested serum, whole blood, and urine samples from 8 patients among the 18 who were transported to local hospitals; we also tested a sample of the herbal """"incense"""" product """"AK-47 24 Karat Gold,"""" which was implicated in the outbreak. Samples were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The synthetic cannabinoid methyl 2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3-methylbutanoate (AMB-FUBINACA, also known as MMB-FUBINACA or FUB-AMB) was identified in AK-47 24 Karat Gold at a mean (�SD) concentration of 16.0�3.9 mg per gram. The de-esterified acid metabolite was found in the serum or whole blood of all eight patients, with concentrations ranging from 77 to 636 ng per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS: The potency of the synthetic cannabinoid identified in these analyses is consistent with strong depressant effects that account for the """"zombielike"""" behavior reported in this mass intoxication.

The aim of this open-label study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ixekizumab, a humanized, anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in Japanese patients with plaque psoriasis (n = 78, including 11 psoriatic arthritis), erythrodermic psoriasis (n = 8) and generalized pustular psoriasis (n = 5). Ixekizumab was administrated s.c. at baseline (week 0, 160 mg), from weeks 2 to 12 (80 mg every 2 weeks), and from weeks 16 to 52 (80 mg every 4 weeks). At week 52, 92.3% of patients with plaque psoriasis achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 80.8% achieved PASI 90, 48.7% achieved PASI 100, and 52.6% had remission of plaques (by static Physician Global Assessment, sPGA [0]). Difficult to treat areas of psoriasis (nail or scalp) also responded to ixekizumab. All patients with psoriatic arthritis who were assessed (5/5) achieved an American College of Rheumatology 20 response. Most patients with erythrodermic psoriasis or generalized pustular psoriasis responded to ixekizumab and the clinical outcome was maintained over 52 weeks (75% and 60% of patients achieved sPGA [0, 1] at week 52, respectively). Mostly mild or moderate treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 79 of 91 patients; the most common were nasopharyngitis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, urticaria and injection site reactions.

2137,23121377,Tolvaptan in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,"""BACKGROUND: The course of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is often associated with pain, hypertension, and kidney failure. Preclinical studies indicated that vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonists inhibit cyst growth and slow the decline of kidney function. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year trial, we randomly assigned 1445 patients, 18 to 50 years of age, who had ADPKD with a total kidney volume of 750 ml or more and an estimated creatinine clearance of 60 ml per minute or more, in a 2:1 ratio to receive tolvaptan, a V(2)-receptor antagonist, at the highest of three twice-daily dose regimens that the patient found tolerable, or placebo. The primary outcome was the annual rate of change in the total kidney volume. Sequential secondary end points included a composite of time to clinical progression (defined as worsening kidney function, kidney pain, hypertension, and albuminuria) and rate of kidney-function decline. RESULTS: Over a 3-year period, the increase in total kidney volume in the tolvaptan group was 2.8% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 3.1), versus 5.5% per year in the placebo group (95% CI, 5.1 to 6.0; P<0.001). The composite end point favored tolvaptan over placebo (44 vs. 50 events per 100 follow-up-years, P=0.01), with lower rates of worsening kidney function (2 vs. 5 events per 100 person-years of follow-up, P<0.001) and kidney pain (5 vs. 7 events per 100 person-years of follow-up, P=0.007). Tolvaptan was associated with a slower decline in kidney function (reciprocal of the serum creatinine level, -2.61 [mg per milliliter](-1) per year vs. -3.81 [mg per milliliter](-1) per year; P<0.001). There were fewer ADPKD-related adverse events in the tolvaptan group but more events related to aquaresis (excretion of electrolyte-free water) and hepatic adverse events unrelated to ADPKD, contributing to a higher discontinuation rate (23%, vs. 14% in the placebo group). CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan, as compared with placebo, slowed the increase in total kidney volume and the decline in kidney function over a 3-year period in patients with ADPKD but was associated with a higher discontinuation rate, owing to adverse events.

2139,27552384,A Review of Azathioprine-Associated Hepatotoxicity and Myelosuppression in Myasthenia Gravis,"OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies interfere with neuromuscular transmission. Azathioprine (AZA) is an immunosuppressant frequently used for treatment of various autoimmune conditions, including MG. The literature suggests that the rates of AZA-associated hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression in MG are highly variable. Published studies have not formally analyzed their pattern, severity, timing, and/or recovery. We assessed the prevalence, pattern and timing of AZA associated toxicity in a large group of MG patients. METHODS: We identified 113 patients with MG with AZA-associated toxicity among 571 managed with this immunosuppressant. The timing of when toxicities occurred as well as pattern of laboratory abnormalities was assessed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression was 15.2% and 9.1%, respectively. The most common pattern of hepatotoxicity seen was gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) enzyme elevation in 67.8% of patients. Of note, 21.2% of patients with myelosuppression had normocytic anemia, 17.3% had pancytopenia, and another 17.3% developed macrocytic anemia. CONCLUSIONS: AZA-associated hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression in MG are not uncommon and may be underrecognized depending on the timing, frequency, and specific tests ordered for blood work monitoring.",1

Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of oncogenic V600 BRAF serine-threonine kinase. Mutations in the BRAF gene which substitute the valine at amino acid position 600 constitutively activate BRAF proteins, which will drive cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors. Results from a phase 3 trial (N=675) comparing vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (taken either with or without food) to standard treatment dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma were submitted. The study met its primary efficacy objective after an interim analysis of overall survival. Patients were allowed to cross-over to the experimental arm following disclosure of the study results after the first interim analysis. In the update of the analysis, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months versus 13.2 months for DTIC and vemurafenib, respectively (HR=0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54, 0.84; cut-off 3 October 2011). Based on the updated analysis, the CHMP concluded that a survival benefit over DTIC had been convincingly demonstrated, in the overall population. The follow-up was considered sufficiently mature with close to 50% of the events observed. The most common side effects (affecting more than 30% of patients) in vemurafenib treated patients included arthralgia, fatigue, rash, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, alopecia and pruritus. Some patients treated with vemurafenib developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma which was readily treated by local surgery. The objective of this paper is to summarise the scientific review of the application leading to regulatory approval in the European Union (EU).

There is limited evidence-based literature to help guide the management of patients with lymphoma in the setting of HCV reactivation. To address this issue we report an illustrative case and review the prevalence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in HCV-infected patients; the role of HCV in lymphomagenesis; the role of antiviral therapy in the management of HCV-associated lymphomas; as well as comparing the outcomes for NHL patients with and without HCV infection. CASE REPORT: A patient diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was treated with rituximab and chemotherapy with the patient achieving a complete remission, but treatment was complicated by asymptomatic HCV reactivation. Because conflicting data exist regarding management of such cases, the criteria for discontinuing chemotherapy, in the event of escalation in HCV replication in an asymptomatic patient, remain unclear. CONCLUSION: Patients with HCV have increased prevalence of marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Whether HCV has a role in the lymphomagenesis is still uncertain, and limited to conjecture. The question whether to treat HCV-related lymphomas with antiviral therapy is debatable and not well-supported. Without initial liver dysfunction, HCV-infected patients can experience a similar outcome compared to their HCV-negative counterparts when treated with standard chemotherapy/immunotherapy despite differences in the presentation of the disease.""",1

The primary outcome, assessed in the intent-to-treat population, was therapeutic response (hepatitis B virus DNA <5 log(10) copies/mL and either HBeAg loss or normalization of alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level). RESULTS: The therapeutic response to telbivudine was superior to that of lamivudine in HBeAg-positive (63% vs 48%; P < .001) and HBeAg-negative (78% vs 66%; P = .007) patients. HBeAg-positive patients given telbivudine also had better outcomes compared with lamivudine in terms of nondetectable viremia (< 300 copies/mL) at 55.6% versus 38.5% (P < .001), HBeAg loss at 35.2% versus 29.2% (P = .056), and viral resistance at 25.1% versus 39.5% (P < .001). Hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion was 29.6% versus 24.7% (P = .095) in all patients and 36% versus 27% (P = .022) in patients with baseline ALT level > or = 2 times normal.

The present study investigated whether tangible social support could buffer the effect of financial stress on psychological and psychosomatic health. Two separate postal surveys were sent to random samples in five counties in Sweden in 2004 and 2008, with a total of 84 263 respondents. The questionnaires included questions about financial stress, tangible social support, psychosomatic symptoms, and psychological well-being (General Health Questionnaire-12). Individuals with high financial stress and low tangible social support had six to seven times increased odds ratios for low psychological well-being and many psychosomatic symptoms. By contrast, individuals with high financial stress and high tangible social support had only two to three times increased odds ratios for low psychological well-being and three to four times increased odds ratios for many psychosomatic symptoms, suggesting a buffering effect of tangible social support. Consistent with the buffering hypothesis, there were significant interactions between financial stress and social support, particularly in relation to low psychological well-being. Social support had its strongest effect at high levels of financial stress. The question whether the altering of our social networks may improve physical health is important for the prevention of ill health in people experiencing financial stress. Strengthening social networks may have the potential to influence health-care costs and improve quality of life. ",0

2150,31216398,Magnetic Resonance Perfusion or Fractional Flow Reserve in Coronary Disease,"BACKGROUND: In patients with stable angina, two strategies are often used to guide revascularization: one involves myocardial-perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the other involves invasive angiography and measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR). Whether a cardiovascular MRI-based strategy is noninferior to an FFR-based strategy with respect to major adverse cardiac events has not been established. METHODS: We performed an unblinded, multicenter, clinical-effectiveness trial by randomly assigning 918 patients with typical angina and either two or more cardiovascular risk factors or a positive exercise treadmill test to a cardiovascular MRI-based strategy or an FFR-based strategy. Revascularization was recommended for patients in the cardiovascular-MRI group with ischemia in at least 6% of the myocardium or in the FFR group with an FFR of 0.8 or less. The composite primary outcome was death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization within 1 year. The noninferiority margin was a risk difference of 6 percentage points. RESULTS: A total of 184 of 454 patients (40.5%) in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 213 of 464 patients (45.9%) in the FFR group met criteria to recommend revascularization (P?=?0.11). Fewer patients in the cardiovascular-MRI group than in the FFR group underwent index revascularization (162 [35.7%] vs. 209 [45.0%], P?=?0.005). The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 421 patients (3.6%) in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 16 of 430 patients (3.7%) in the FFR group (risk difference, -0.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 2.4), findings that met the noninferiority threshold. The percentage of patients free from angina at 12 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (49.2% in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 43.8% in the FFR group, P?=?0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stable angina and risk factors for coronary artery disease, myocardial-perfusion cardiovascular MRI was associated with a lower incidence of coronary revascularization than FFR and was noninferior to FFR with respect to major adverse cardiac events.

For many years, anthracyclines and taxanes have been the mainstay of treatment for MBC, but these agents are now commonly administered earlier in the course of the disease. A recent meta-analysis revealed adverse effects on OS and overall response rates in patients with MBC receiving first-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy following relapse on adjuvant chemotherapy. Noncrossresistant cytotoxic agents and combinations that combine high clinical activity and acceptable tolerability while being convenient for patients are therefore needed for the first-line treatment of MBC patients. Capecitabine has substantial antitumor activity in the first-line treatment of patients with MBC in prospective, randomized, phase II/III clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with biologic and novel agents. First-line capecitabine monotherapy has a favorable safety profile, lacking myelosuppression and alopecia, and does not compromise the administration of further lines of chemotherapy. Capecitabine is suitable for long-term administration without the cumulative toxicity that can limit the prolonged use of other chemotherapy agents.

Participants who were HCV antibody-positive at enrolment and those with HCV antibody seroconversion during follow-up (1996 to 2012) were tested for HCV RNA and sequenced (Core-E2 region). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood analysis and clusters were identified using ClusterPicker (90% bootstrap threshold, 0.05 genetic distance threshold). Factors associated with clustering were assessed using logistic regression. Among 655 eligible participants, HCV genotype prevalence was: G1a: 48% (n=313), G1b: 6% (n=41), G2a: 3% (n=20), G2b: 7% (n=46), G3a: 33% (n=213), G4a: <1% (n=4), G6a: 1% (n=8), G6e: <1% (n=1), and unclassifiable: 1% (n=9). The mean age was 36 years, 162 (25%) were female, and 164 (25%) were HIV+. Among 501 participants with HCV G1a and G3a, 31% (n=156) were in a pair/cluster. Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included: age <40 (versus age?40, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 2.63), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AOR=1.82; 95% CI 1.18, 2.81), HCV seroconversion (AOR=3.05; 95% CI 1.40, 6.66), and recent syringe borrowing (AOR 1.59; 95% CI 1.07, 2.36). CONCLUSION: In this sample of PWID, one-third demonstrated phylogenetic clustering. Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included younger age, recent HCV seroconversion, prevalent HIV infection, and recent syringe borrowing.

2157,26928938,"Human intrahepatic regulatory T cells are functional, require IL-2 from effector cells for survival, and are susceptible to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis","Regulatory T cells (Treg ) suppress T effector cell proliferation and maintain immune homeostasis. Autoimmune liver diseases persist despite high frequencies of Treg in the liver, suggesting that the local hepatic microenvironment might affect Treg stability, survival, and function. We hypothesized that interactions between Treg and endothelial cells during recruitment and then with epithelial cells within the liver affect Treg stability, survival, and function. To model this, we explored the function of Treg after migration through human hepatic sinusoidal-endothelium (postendothelial migrated Treg [PEM Treg ]) and the effect of subsequent interactions with cholangiocytes and local proinflammatory cytokines on survival and stability of Treg . Our findings suggest that the intrahepatic microenvironment is highly enriched with proinflammatory cytokines but deficient in the Treg survival cytokine interleukin (IL)-2. Migration through endothelium into a model mimicking the inflamed liver microenvironment did not affect Treg stability; however, functional capacity was reduced. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous IL-2 enhanced PEM Treg phosphorylated STAT5 signaling compared with PEMCD8. CD4 and CD8 T cells are the main source of IL-2 in the inflamed liver. Liver-infiltrating Treg reside close to bile ducts and coculture with cholangiocytes or their supernatants induced preferential apoptosis of Treg compared with CD8 effector cells. Treg from diseased livers expressed high levels of CD95, and their apoptosis was inhibited by IL-2 or blockade of CD95. CONCLUSION: Recruitment through endothelium does not impair Treg stability, but a proinflammatory microenvironment deficient in IL-2 leads to impaired function and increased susceptibility of Treg to epithelial cell-induced Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results provide a mechanism to explain Treg dysfunction in inflamed tissues and suggest that IL-2 supplementation, particularly if used in conjunction with Treg therapy, could restore immune homeostasis in inflammatory and autoimmune liver disease.

2158,12879992,Hepatotoxicity of hypolipidemic drugs,"Dyslipidemic conditions and their cardiovascular related complications are common. Effective primary and secondary prevention strategies include therapies to lower LDL and total cholesterol and to increase HDL. Further, it seems that there is a need for therapeutic reduction in triglycerides as it emerges as an independent risk factor for CVD. Many clinical trials have been designed to evaluate pharmacologic compounds in the treatment of the dyslipidemias and they seem to have shown a safe profile, both in the experiment phases and in post-marketing observation studies. Nevertheless, sporadic reports of hepatotoxicity with statins and niacin still arise (Table 2). Although routine hepatic biochemical test monitoring is recommended, the cost-effectiveness is questionable because often these reactions are idiosyncratic and may not be identified by this routine screening. The risk/benefit ratio is in favor of using these medications in individuals at risk. There is no evidence to suggest intrinsic hepatotoxic activity as such. Drugs that lower triglycerides such as fibrates, have been observed to improve hepatic biochemical tests, although in small series. This leads to speculation whether treatment with fibrates would be beneficial for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is emerging as one of enormous magnitude.",1

HLRCC-associated renal cancer is highly aggressive and frequently presents as a solitary mass. We reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 9 patients with renal tumors presenting as sporadic cases but who were later proven to have FH germline mutations. Histologically, all tumors showed mixed architectural patterns, with papillary as the dominant pattern in only 3 cases. Besides papillary, tubular, tubulopapillary, solid, and cystic elements, 6 of 9 tumors contained collecting duct carcinoma-like areas with infiltrating tubules, nests, or individual cells surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. Prominent tubulocystic carcinoma-like component and sarcomatoid differentiation were identified. Although all tumors exhibited the proposed hallmark of HLRCC (large eosinophilic nucleolus surrounded by a clear halo), this feature was often not uniformly present throughout the tumor. Prior studies have shown that a high level of fumarate accumulated in HLRCC tumor cells causes aberrant succination of cellular proteins by forming a stable chemical modification, S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC), which can be detected by immunohistochemistry. We thus explored the utility of detecting 2SC by immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of HLRCC tumors and other high-grade renal tumors and investigated the correlation between 2SC staining and FH molecular alterations. All confirmed HLRCC tumors demonstrated diffuse and strong nuclear and cytoplasmic 2SC staining, whereas all clear cell (184/184, 100%), most high-grade unclassified (93/97, 96%), and the large majority of """"type 2"""" papillary (35/45, 78%) renal cell carcinoma cases showed no 2SC immunoreactivity. A subset of papillary (22%) and rare unclassified (4%) tumors showed patchy or diffuse cytoplasmic staining without nuclear labeling, unlike the pattern seen with confirmed HLRCC tumors. Sequencing revealed no germline or somatic FH alterations in 14 tumors that either exhibited only cytoplasmic 2SC staining (n=5) or were negative for 2SC (n=9), despite their HLRCC-like morphologic features. Our results emphasize the pivotal role of pathologic examination in the diagnosis of HLRCC patients and indicate immunohistochemical detection of 2SC as a useful ancillary tool in the differentiation of HLRCC renal tumors from other high-grade renal cell carcinomas.

2160,18052761,Role of tolcapone in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,"For decades, the cornerstone of treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been levodopa, which provides a smooth clinical response early in the course of disease. However, many PD patients develop motor complications on long-term levodopa therapy. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a selective and widely distributed enzyme involved in the catabolism of levodopa. Tolcapone and entacapone are selective and potent COMT inhibitors that slow the metabolism of levodopa, thus prolonging its effects. While both drugs act peripherally, tolcapone also inhibits COMT in the CNS. Tolcapone has been shown to be an effective adjunct in the treatment of PD in Phase II and III clinical trials, improving motor fluctuations and reducing levodopa requirements. Rare reports of severe hepatotoxicity, however, limited tolcapone's implementation in the treatment of PD. A reappraisal of the data for tolcapone treatment in PD has found that this risk is very small if proper hepatic monitoring guidelines are followed. This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical data on tolcapone, with particular focus on drug safety and the future role of tolcapone therapy in the treatment of PD.",1

In total, 509 subjects enrolled and received open-label colesevelam hydrochloride 3.75 g/day for 52 weeks. Safety and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride was evaluated by the incidence and severity of adverse events. In total, 360 subjects (70.7%) completed the extension. Of the safety population, 361 subjects (70.9%) experienced an adverse event, most (88.1%) being mild or moderate in severity. Fifty-six adverse events (11.0%) were drug-related; the most frequent drug-related adverse events were constipation and dyspepsia. Thirty-five subjects (6.9%) discontinued due to an adverse event. Fifty-four subjects (10.6%) experienced a serious adverse event; only one was considered drug-related (diverticulitis). Seventeen subjects (3.3%) experienced hypoglycemia; most episodes were mild or moderate in severity.

2163,8781325,Immunogenicity of biliary epithelium: investigation of antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells,"The intrahepatic biliary epithelium is susceptible to extensive T-cell-mediated damage during primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and hepatic allograft rejection. During these processes, human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC) become activated and express high levels of the lymphocyte adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and lymphocyte-associated antigen (LFA)-3, and of class II MHC antigens. It follows that activated HIBEC may also play a direct role in the activation of antigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes. The capacity of class II MHC antigen-expressing HIBEC to present antigen and induce specific proliferation of CD4+ T cells was examined in this study. Lines of purified HIBEC were activated by culture with the proinflammatory cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor a and were mixed in coculture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells. The result of interaction between these cells was assessed by measurement of lymphoproliferation and IL-2 production. Class II MHC antigen-expressing HIBEC failed to induce either lymphoproliferation or IL-2 production. However, both of these parameters of T-cell activation were positive in cocultures when a costimulation signal was delivered to T cells by adding bivalent anti-CD28 antibodies. The antigen-specific activation of these T cells was further enhanced by the addition of a cross-linking secondary antibody that caused CD28 receptor aggregation. The failure of cytokine-stimulated HIBEC to induce T-cell activation is consistent with the observation that HIBEC do not express the costimulatory CD28 ligands B7-1 or B7-2 at either mRNA or protein levels. It may be concluded that HIBEC are unlikely to play a direct role in activation of antigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes within the inflamed liver.",0

Our knowledge has evolved from the patient to the molecule, using experimental models that serve as a source for understanding the complex pathophysiological mechanisms that govern this complex syndrome. We now know that progressive vasodilatation is central to the detrimental effects observed in multiple organs. Although nitric oxide has been shown to be the primary vasodilator molecule in these effects, other molecules also participate in the complex mechanisms of vasodilatation.

Previous trials of amiodarone prophylaxis, while promising, were relatively small and yielded conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a brief perioperative course of oral amiodarone is an effective and safe prophylaxis for atrial tachyarrhythmias after cardiac surgery overall and in important subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Double-blind randomized controlled trial of 601 patients listed for nonemergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and/or valve replacement/repair surgery between February 1, 1999, and September 26, 2003, at a tertiary care hospital. The patients were followed up for 1 year. INTERVENTION: Oral amiodarone (10 mg/kg daily) or placebo administered 6 days prior to surgery through 6 days after surgery (13 days). Randomization was stratified for subgroups defined by age, type of surgery, and use of preoperative beta-blockers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting 5 minutes or longer that prompted therapy by the sixth postoperative day. RESULTS: Atrial tachyarrhythmias occurred in fewer amiodarone patients (48/299; 16.1%) than in placebo patients (89/302; 29.5%) overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.69; P<.001); in patients younger than 65 years (19 [11.2%] vs 36 [21.1%]; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.28-0.94]; P = .02); in patients aged 65 years or older (28 [21.7%] vs 54 [41.2%]; HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.27-0.75]; P<.001); in patients who had CABG surgery only (22 [11.3%] vs 46 [23.6%]; HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.79]; P = .002); in patients who had valve replacement/repair surgery with or without CABG surgery (25 [23.8%] vs 44 [44.1%]; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.31-0.84; P = .008); in patients who received preoperative beta-blocker therapy (27 [15.3%] vs 42 [25.0%]; HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34-0.99]; P = .03); and in patients who did not receive preoperative beta-blocker therapy (20 [16.3%] vs 48 [35.8%]; HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.22-0.71]; P<.001), respectively. Postoperative sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred less frequently in amiodarone patients (1/299; 0.3%) than in placebo patients (8/302; 2.6%) (P = .04). Dosage reductions of blinded therapy were more common in amiodarone patients (34/299; 11.4%) than in placebo patients (16/302; 5.3%) (P = .008). There were no differences in serious postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, or readmission to the hospital within 6 months of discharge or in 1-year mortality. CONCLUSION: Oral amiodarone prophylaxis of atrial tachyarrhythmias after cardiac surgery is effective and may be safe overall and in important patient subgroups.

2167,1528209,The publication of sponsored symposiums in medical journals,"BACKGROUND: An increasing proportion of spending by the pharmaceutical industry has gone to funding symposiums that are published by peer-reviewed medical journals. This study tests the hypothesis that such sponsorship, particularly by a single pharmaceutical company, is associated with a promotional orientation of the symposium and a distortion of the peer-review process. METHODS: We counted the symposiums published in 58 journals of clinical medicine and surveyed the journal editors regarding their policies for symposium issues. We analyzed the symposium issues that appeared in the 11 journals that published the most symposiums in order to determine the sponsor or sponsors, the topics, whether the titles were misleading, whether brand names were used, and whether the featured drugs were classified by the Food and Drug Administration as innovative or approved. RESULTS: The number of symposiums published per year increased steadily from 1966 through 1989. Forty-two percent of those analyzed (262 of 625) had a single pharmaceutical company as the sponsor. These symposiums were more likely than those with other sponsors to have misleading titles (P less than 0.001) and to use brand names (P less than 0.001), and less likely to be peer-reviewed in the same manner as other articles in the parent journal (P less than 0.001). Of the 161 symposiums that focused on a single drug, 51 percent concerned unapproved therapies; 14 percent concerned drugs classified as bringing important therapeutic gains. CONCLUSIONS: Symposiums sponsored by drug companies often have promotional attributes and are not peer-reviewed. Financial relations among symposium participants, sponsors, and journals should be completely disclosed, symposiums should be clearly identified, and journal editors should maintain editorial control over contributions from symposiums.",0
2168,29183391,Oxidative stress and cellular pathologies in Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. The reason for the death of these neurons is unclear; however, studies have demonstrated the potential involvement of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, α-synuclein or dopamine levels in contributing to cellular oxidative stress as well as PD symptoms. Even though those papers had separately described the individual roles of each element leading to neurodegeneration, recent publications suggest that neurodegeneration is the product of various cellular interactions. This review discusses the role of oxidative stress in mediating separate pathological events that together, ultimately result in cell death in PD. Understanding the multi-faceted relationships between these events, with oxidative stress as a common denominator underlying these processes, is needed for developing better therapeutic strategies.

2169,23827971,Impaired autophagy and APP processing in Alzheimer's disease: The potential role of Beclin 1 interactome,"The accumulation of amyloid-β-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-β peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-β. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

2170,7927266,Mechanism of activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by arginine vasopressin in hepatocytes,"Arginine vasopressin has been shown to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger in hepatocytes by calcium/calmodulin-dependent processes. Whether this activation also involves protein kinase C and is associated with changes in the intracellular pH setpoint was investigated in this study. Changes in pHi and intracellular Ca++ concentration were measured with the fluorescent probes BCECF and quin-2, respectively. Intracellular pH recovery rate was calculated from time-dependent changes in intracellular pH in hepatocytes acid-loaded with sodium propionate. Arginine vasopressin, phorbol myristate acetate and thapsigargin stimulated intracellular pH recovery but did not increase basal intracellular pH. Arginine vasopressin and thapsigargin, but not phorbol myristol acetate, increased intracellular Ca++ concentration. The protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C inhibited arginine vasopressin- and phorbol myristol acetate-induced, but not thapsigargin-induced, intracellular pH recovery. Neither staurosporine nor calphostin C affected arginine vasopressin- and thapsigargin-induced increases in intracellular Ca++ concentration, and no inhibitor affected basal intracellular pH recovery. Arginine vasopressin, phorbol myristol acetate and thapsigargin increased intracellular pH dependency of intracellular pH recovery without affecting intracellular pH setpoint. These results indicate that the activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by arginine vasopressin is mediated both by Ca++/calmodulin and protein kinase C and may be due to enhanced interaction of H+ with the internal modifier site of the exchanger.",0
2171,3934499,Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency--the effects of betaine treatment in pyridoxine-responsive patients,"""Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency may be responsive to pyridoxine, a precursor of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, and the amount of residual enzyme activity present is the probable determinant of this. In six treated pyridoxine-responsive patients whose biochemical control of fasting plasma amino acid levels appeared optimal, we assessed the effects on plasma amino acids of standard oral methionine loads (4g/m2 of body area) before and after adding betaine (trimethylglycine) 6 g/d, to the treatment regimen of pyridoxine and folic acid. Our aim was to define the capacity of these patients to metabolize methionine and to determine whether betaine would effect a reduction in postload homocysteine levels. During the 24 hours after the methionine challenge all patients had higher plasma methionine and homocysteine and lower cysteine than did 17 normal subjects. After betaine these homocysteine responses were reduced to near normal, and there was a trend toward increased methionine. There was a direct correlation between premethionine fasting homocysteine and mean homocysteine responses during the 24 hours following the methionine load, both before (r = 0.79) and after betaine (r = 0.71). Betaine also increased plasma cysteine levels in patients with the more severe biochemical abnormalities. After betaine there were modest increases in plasma serine (mean increase 25%; P less than 0.025). Since the vascular complications of homocystinuria are related to increased plasma homocysteine, betaine therapy may reduce this risk in patients receiving a standard pyridoxine and folic acid regimen in whom there are abnormal homocysteine responses after a standard methionine load.""",1

Humidified starch (duration of humidification is 30-35 minutes) was used as a filler material (approximately 20% w/w) in olive oil to make the ER system, and benzocaine (BZN) was used as the model drug. The average particle size of starch in the olive oil was approximately 200 nm. 1N HCl was used as the receiver medium and BZN was assayed by UV spectroscopy at 226 nm. A series of studies was done at five temperatures (25 degrees, 30 degrees, 35 degrees, 40 degrees, and 45 degrees C) and two external electric fields (E-fields) that were generated by applying potential drops across the diffusion apparatus of 0 V and 290 V. Control studies of BZN release from olive oil without filler showed little or no increase in release rates resulting from application of E-fields. In addition, while reversing the polarity for BZN in olive oil caused differences in release rates, these differences were too small to explain the results obtained for the ER systems. It was found that release of BZN increased significantly with the application of the electric field (approximately 53% increase at 25 degrees C). A plot of the log of the release rate vs 1/T was linear for the 0 V data but deviated from linearity for the 290 V data. The increase in release rates due to the E-field became smaller as the temperature was increased. The results are consistent with (but are not sufficient to prove) the hypothesis that the increased release rate is due to a small amount of ordering of the cornstarch filler particles in response to the applied E-field, which results in a reduction in the tortuosity of the system.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir and the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, with and without ribavirin. METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind trial, between Oct 21, 2013, and Oct 30, 2014, we enrolled patients with HCV genotype 1 and compensated cirrhosis who had not achieved SVR after successive treatments with pegylated interferon and protease-inhibitor regimens at 20 sites in France. With a computer-generated randomisation sequence, patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo matched in appearance to study drugs for 12 weeks followed by once daily combination fixed-dose tablets of 90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks, or ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was SVR 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12), for which 95% CIs were calculated with the Clopper-Pearson method. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01965535. FINDINGS: Of 172 patients screened, 155 entered randomisation, 77 were assigned to receive ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin and 78 ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. 114 (74%) were men, 151 (97%), were white, 98 (63%) had HCV genotype 1a, and 145 (94%) had non-CC IL28B alleles. SVR12 rates were 96% (95% CI 89-99) for patients in the ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin group and 97% (91-100) in the ledipasvir-sofosbuvir group. One patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events while receiving only placebo. The most frequent adverse events were asthenia and headache, pruritus, and fatigue. INTERPRETATION: Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks and ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 24 weeks provided similarly high SVR12 rates in previous non-responders with HCV genotype 1 and compensated cirrhosis. The shorter regimen, when given with ribavirin, might, therefore, be useful to treat treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis if longer-term treatment is not possible.

VPA-985 produced a significant overall aquaretic response compared with placebo, with significant dose related increases in free water clearance (P <.05) and serum sodium (P <.05), without significant changes in orthostatic blood pressure or serum creatinine levels. Five patients (50%) on 250 mg twice daily had to have medication withheld on multiple occasions. End-of-study plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly in the 2 larger dose groups. In conclusion, VPA-985 appears effective and safe in appropriate doses in correcting abnormal renal water handling and hyponatremia in conditions associated with water retention. Higher doses of VPA-985 may produce significant dehydration and will require close monitoring with their use.",0
2180,22610996,Tracing hepatitis B virus to the 16th century in a Korean mummy,"A rare find of a mummified child from the 16th century AD, in Korea, with relatively preserved organs, enabled a search for ancient hepatitis B virus (aHBV) DNA sequences from laparoscopic-derived liver biopsies. Analysis of the complete aHBV genome (3,215 base pairs) revealed a unique HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2) sequence commonly spread in Southeast Asia, which probably represents an HBV that infected the Joseon Dynasty population in Korea. Comparison of the aHBV sequences with contemporary HBV/C2 DNA sequences revealed distinctive differences along four open reading frames. Genetic diversity between contemporary and recovered aHBV/C2 DNA may be the result of immunologic, environmental, and/or pharmacologic pressures. The calculated time of most recent common ancestor suggests that the Korean HBV sequence origin dates back at least 3,000 years and possibly as long as 100,000 years. This isolate most likely represents the earliest human HBV sequence that colonized Southeast Asia by human migration. CONCLUSION: This study describes the complete sequence of the oldest HBV isolate and the most ancient full viral genome known so far.",0

2182,31400100,An Online Geographic Data Visualization Tool to Relate Preterm Births to Environmental Factors,"Preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) continues to be a significant cause of disease and death in the United States. Its complex causes are associated with several genetic, biological, environmental, and sociodemographic factors. Organizing and visualizing various data that may be related to preterm birth is an essential step for pattern exploration and hypothesis generation and presents an opportunity to increase public and stakeholder involvement. In this article, we describe a collaborative effort to create an online geographic data visualization tool using open software to explore preterm birth in Fresno County, where rates are the highest in California. The tool incorporates information on births, environmental exposures, sociodemographic characteristics, the built environment, and access to care. We describe data sets used to build the tool, the data-hosting platform, and the process used to engage stakeholders in its creation. We highlight an important example of how collaboration can increase the utility of geographic data visualization to improve public health and address health equity in birth outcomes. ",0
2183,20635398,Is sexual contact a major mode of hepatitis C virus transmission?,"Medical opinion varies considerably regarding the transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) through sexual contact. Based on the study design, representativeness of the study population, and the methods used for case ascertainment, we analyzed 80 qualifying reports regarding the evidence for or against sexual transmission. Regarding heterosexual transmission, the weight of evidence is that there is no increased risk of sexual transmission of HCV among heterosexual couples in regular relationships. This risk increases among persons with multiple sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.2-2.9), but this association may be confounded by increased likelihood of injection drug use with increased number of partners. There appears to be a real increased risk for women coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other sexually transmitted infections (aOR 3.3-3.9) and especially for HIV-infected gay men who are having sex with one another compared with HIV-uninfected men (aOR 4.1-5.7). HIV-infected gay men increase their risk of such transmission in association with practices that lead to mucosal trauma (multiple sexual partners, fisting, use of sex toys) and the presence of genital ulcerative disease. CONCLUSION: This review should inform, and not distract from, recommendations to reduce the risk of HCV transmission. Health care providers need to pay special attention to sexual transmission of HCV among HIV-infected individuals.",0

2186,1458761,Clinical pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine,"""Ketorolac is a new chiral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is marketed for analgesia as the racemate. The drug is administered as the water soluble tromethamine salt and is available in tablets or as an intramuscular injection. The absorption of ketorolac is rapid, Cmax being attained between 20 to 60 min. Its oral bioavailability is estimated to range from 80 to 100%. The drug is extensively bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution (0.1 to 0.3 L/kg) comparable with those of other NSAIDs. Only small concentrations of ketorolac are detectable in umbilical vein blood after administration to women in labour. The elimination half-life is between 4 and 6h and is moderate in comparison with other NSAIDs. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ketorolac is proportional to the dose after intramuscular administration of therapeutic doses to young healthy volunteers. Ketorolac is extensively metabolised through glucuronidation and oxidation; little if any drug is eliminated unchanged. Most of the dose of ketorolac is recovered in the urine as conjugated drug. Although ketorolac is excreted into the breast milk, the amount of drug transferred comprises only a small fraction of the maternal exposure. Little stereoselectivity was present in the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac in a healthy volunteer receiving single intravenous or oral doses. The elderly exhibit reduced clearance of the drug. Renal insufficiency appears to cause an accumulation of ketorolac in plasma, although hepatic disease may not affect the pharmacokinetics.""",1

2188,8712879,A 10 year follow up of parenteral gold therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVES: To study the long term tolerance of parenteral gold and subsequent drug treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including prediction of outcome and 'survival' of sequential treatments. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 376 patients was made, including a detailed screening of 237 patients treated in 1989. Reasons for discontinuing treatment were analysed in life table analyses, which were used to compare patients receiving parenteral gold treatment in 1985 and 1989, and two groups of patients receiving disease modifying antirheumatic drugs after parenteral gold treatment. The causes of discontinuation were followed in sequential treatments. RESULTS: The estimated probability of discontinuation of parenteral gold treatment was 29% after six months and 42%, 55%, 74%, and 92% after 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Mucocutaneous side effects were the main cause of discontinuation of parenteral gold treatment during the first three years, while the probability of discontinuation because of inefficacy dominated after four years. Side effects also constituted the main cause of discontinuation of treatments given after parenteral gold treatment during the first three years of follow up. No significant differences were found when comparing the termination rates between the first and the second and subsequent treatments after parenteral gold treatment. The main reasons for discontinuing one treatment could not predict the cause of discontinuation of the next treatment. CONCLUSION: Mucocutaneous side effects dominated initially, while inefficacy was the dominating cause of discontinuation of long term parenteral gold treatment. No serious side effects were registered. The cause of discontinuation of one treatment did not predict the cause of discontinuation of the following drug. Drug 'survival' was the same in both treatments after parenteral gold treatment.",1
2189,20864900,"Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor: therapy, safety, and appropriate management of adverse events","Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the standard of care for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dasatinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been shown to be efficacious in treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are resistant or intolerant to frontline imatinib. In clinical trials of dasatinib, the adverse events that arise during therapy are mostly mild to moderate in severity and are usually reversible and manageable with appropriate intervention. Cytopenias can be treated with dose modification or interruption. Pleural effusions can be effectively managed with prompt delivery of supportive care and dose modification. Patients at risk of cardiac abnormalities or bleeding-related events require careful monitoring. Pharmacokinetic analysis of dasatinib indicates interactions with a number of other agents and a complete treatment history should be taken before initiating therapy because mitigating drug-drug interactions are critical for patient safety.",1

Recombinant CDH showed the same C-C bond-cleavage and C-C bond-formation activities as the native enzyme. Furthermore, we have shown that CDH catalyzes the asymmetric cross-benzoin reaction of aromatic aldehydes and (decarboxylated) pyruvate (up to quantitative conversion, 92-99 % ee). CDH accepts also hydroxybenzaldehydes and nitrobenzaldehydes; these previously have not (or only in rare cases) been known as substrates of other ThDP-dependent enzymes. On a semipreparative scale, sterically demanding 4-(tert-butyl)benzaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde were transformed into the corresponding 2-hydroxy ketone products in high yields. Additionally, certain benzaldehydes with electron withdrawing substituents were identified as potential inhibitors of the ligase activity of CDH. ",0
2191,6402699,Stimulation of muscle protein degradation and prostaglandin E2 release by leukocytic pyrogen (interleukin-1). A mechanism for the increased degradation of muscle proteins during fever,"To clarify the mechanisms underlying the loss of body protein during fever and sepsis, we incubated rat muscles with highly purified human leukocytic pyrogen. This polypeptide, which appears identical to interleukin-1, is released by leukocytes and signals the onset of fever in the hypothalamus. In muscles incubated at 37 degrees C, leukocytic pyrogen stimulated net protein degradation by 62 to 118 per cent (P less than 0.001). Proteolysis increased, but rates of muscle-protein synthesis did not change. The pyrogen also dramatically stimulated muscle synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which promotes protein breakdown in this tissue. Addition of indomethacin with leukocytic pyrogen prevented prostaglandin E2 synthesis and abolished the increase in proteolysis. The acceleration of protein breakdown induced by pyrogen was also blocked by Ep-475, an inhibitor of lysosomal thiol proteases. When muscles were incubated at 39 degrees C to mimic fever, protein breakdown increased, but addition of leukocytic pyrogen caused a further marked increase in proteolysis and prostaglandin E2 production. Thus, human leukocytic pyrogen can act on skeletal muscle to stimulate intralysosomal proteolysis by increasing the production of prostaglandin E2. These findings suggest that cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of negative nitrogen balance in fever. In addition, the release of prostaglandin E2 induced by leukocytic pyrogen may account for the myalgia that accompanies fever.",0
2192,20972845,Efficacy and safety of flavocoxid compared with naproxen in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee- a subset analysis,"OBJECTIVE: twice-daily flavocoxid, a cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with potent antioxidant activity of botanical origin, was evaluated for 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study against naproxen in 220 subjects with moderate-severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. As previously reported, both groups noted a significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of OA with no detectable differences in efficacy between the groups when the entire intent-to-treat population was considered. This post-hoc analysis compares the efficacy of flavocoxid to naproxen in different subsets of patients, specifically those related to age, gender, and disease severity as reported at baseline for individual response parameters. METHODS: in the original randomized, double-blind study, 220 subjects were assigned to receive either flavocoxid (500 mg twice daily) or naproxen (500 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks. In this subgroup analysis, primary outcome measures including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index and subscales, timed walk, and secondary efficacy variables, including investigator global assessment for disease and global response to treatment, subject visual analog scale for discomfort, overall disease activity, global response to treatment, index joint tenderness and mobility, were evaluated for differing trends between the study groups. RESULTS: subset analyses revealed some statistically significant differences and some notable trends in favor of the flavocoxid group. These trends became stronger the longer the subjects continued on therapy. These observations were specifically noted in older subjects (>60 years), males and in subjects with milder disease, particularly those with lower subject global assessment of disease activity and investigator global assessment for disease and faster walking times at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: initial analysis of the entire intent-to-treat population revealed that flavocoxid was as effective as naproxen in managing the signs and symptoms of OA of the knee. Detailed analyses of subject subsets demonstrated distinct trends in favor of flavocoxid for specific groups of subjects.",1

2194,16697324,Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with the selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist sitaxsentan,"""OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the optimal dose of the selective endothelin A (ET(A)) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); for observation only, an open-label (OL) bosentan arm was included. BACKGROUND: Endothelin is a mediator of PAH. In a preliminary PAH study, the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan improved six-min walk (6MW) distance, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), and hemodynamics. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-week study, 247 PAH patients (idiopathic, or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital heart disease) were randomized; 245 patients were treated: placebo (n = 62), sitaxsentan 50 mg (n = 62) or 100 mg (n = 61), or OL (6MW tests, Borg dyspnea scores, and WHO FC assessments third-party blind) bosentan (n = 60). The primary end point was change in 6MW distance from baseline to week 18. Secondary end points included change in WHO FC, time to clinical worsening, and change in Borg dyspnea score. RESULTS: At week 18, patients treated with sitaxsentan 100 mg had an increased 6MW distance compared with the placebo group (31.4 m, p = 0.03), and an improved WHO FC (p = 0.04). The placebo-subtracted treatment effect for sitaxsentan 50 mg was 24.2 m (p = 0.07) and for OL bosentan, 29.5 m (p = 0.05). The incidence of elevated hepatic transaminases (>3x the upper limit of normal) was 6% for placebo, 5% for sitaxsentan 50 mg, 3% for sitaxsentan 100 mg, and 11% for bosentan. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan, orally once daily at a dose of 100 mg, improves exercise capacity and WHO FC in PAH patients, with a low incidence of hepatic toxicity.""",1

2198,24902006,Overview and management of dermatologic events associated with targeted therapies for medullary thyroid cancer,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have, in recent years, expanded with the approval of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs): vandetanib and cabozantinib. Other agents, including TKIs, are under clinical investigation for MTC. Although patients treated with TKIs are at risk of developing dermatologic adverse events (AE), these untoward events may be mitigated through AE-driven algorithms. SUMMARY: AE-driven algorithms combine effective nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical treatment modalities implemented by a multidisciplinary effort that incorporates nursing interventions, patient education, and referrals to pain-management specialists, podiatrists, and dermatologists, as appropriate. Effective AE prevention and management reduce the need for dose interruptions and modifications, allowing patients the opportunity to derive the maximal benefit from TKI therapy, while maintaining quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal use of targeted therapies in the treatment of MTC depends on careful patient selection, interdisciplinary communication, and patient education and encouragement to enhance compliance and safety, optimize consistent dosing, and maximize the use of effective therapies.",1
2199,18325806,"Changes in Na+/K+-ATPase activity, unsaturated fatty acids and metallothioneins in gills of the shore crab Carcinus aestuarii after dilute seawater acclimation","We have assessed the activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, cAMP, free fatty acids (FFA) and metallothionein (MT) in the posterior gills of the brackish water shore crab Carcinus aestuarii during acclimation to 10 ppt dilute seawater (DSW). Following 3-18 days acclimation in DSW specific activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in native gill homogenates and partially purified membrane vesicles was progressively increased, from 1.7- to 3.9-fold. After short-term acclimation of crabs in DSW with added sucrose to make media isosmotic with the haemolymph the specific Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in homogenates was not increased, relative to SW enzyme activity. Moreover, hyposmotic conditions led to depletion of cAMP in gills. In partially purified membrane vesicles isolated from posterior gills, fatty acids with compositions 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:4 and 20:5 dominated in both SW- and DSW-acclimated Carcinus. During a year in which the metabolic activity of crabs was increased, the arachidonic/linoleic acids ratio (ARA/LA) for DSW-acclimated crabs was markedly increased relative to that in SW. Increased Na(+)+K(+)-ATPase activity under hyposmotic stress may be modulated at least partially by the changed proportion of fatty acids in the purified membranes of posterior gills. Long-term acclimation of shore crabs to DSW resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in cytosolic metallothionein (MT) content in posterior gills over those in SW crabs. Assuming an antioxidant role of MT associated with intracellular zinc partitioning, the observed MT induction in posterior gills may be considered an adaptive response of C. aestuarii to hyposmotic stress.

National mortality data (2007-2009) and small area estimation methods were used to predict age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning at the county level, which were then mapped in order to explore: whether drug poisoning mortality clusters by county, and where hot and cold spots occur (i.e., groups of counties that evidence extremely high or low age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning). Results highlight several regions of the U.S. where the burden of drug poisoning mortality is especially high. Findings may help inform efforts to address the growing problem of drug poisoning mortality by indicating where the epidemic is concentrated geographically.  ",0

METHODS: We used Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System data abstracted from medical records on 21 adverse events in patients hospitalized in the United States between 2005 and 2011 for acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or conditions requiring surgery. We estimated trends in the rate of occurrence of adverse events for which patients were at risk, the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events, and the number of adverse events per 1000 hospitalizations. RESULTS: The study included 61,523 patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (19%), congestive heart failure (25%), pneumonia (30%), and conditions requiring surgery (27%). From 2005 through 2011, among patients with acute myocardial infarction, the rate of occurrence of adverse events declined from 5.0% to 3.7% (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 1.9), the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events declined from 26.0% to 19.4% (difference, 6.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.3 to 10.2), and the number of adverse events per 1000 hospitalizations declined from 401.9 to 262.2 (difference, 139.7; 95% CI, 90.6 to 189.0). Among patients with congestive heart failure, the rate of occurrence of adverse events declined from 3.7% to 2.7% (difference, 1.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4), the proportion of patients with one or more adverse events declined from 17.5% to 14.2% (difference, 3.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.5), and the number of adverse events per 1000 hospitalizations declined from 235.2 to 166.9 (difference, 68.3; 95% CI, 39.9 to 96.7).

In one case, a 43-year-old female health-care worker required liver transplantation after developing fulminant hepatitis and end-stage hepatic failure while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a needlestick injury (1). In the second case, a 38-year-old male physician was hospitalized with life-threatening fulminant hepatitis while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a mucous membrane exposure. To characterize NVP-associated PEP toxicity, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed MedWatch reports of serious adverse events in persons taking NVP for PEP received by FDA (Figure 1). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that healthy persons taking abbreviated 4-week NVP regimens for PEP are at risk for serious adverse events.

2205,18657023,Bicalutamide-associated fulminant hepatotoxicity,"Abstract Bicalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen used extensively during the start of androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist to reduce occurrence of the symptoms of tumor flare in patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma. The most common adverse effects of bicalutamide are induced by its pharmacologic property of competitive androgen receptor blockade and include gynecomastia, hot flashes, fatigue, and decreased libido. Although not as common, increases in liver function test results are also seen with bicalutamide therapy. These elevations are typically transient, and patients remain asymptomatic. We describe a 59-year-old man with metastatic prostate carcinoma treated with bicalutamide as part of androgen deprivation therapy before starting chemotherapy. At baseline, his liver function test results and serum creatinine concentration were within normal limits, and an abdominal computed tomographic scan did not demonstrate liver metastasis. After 4 days of bicalutamide therapy, the patient came to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, distension, and tenderness. His liver function tests were abnormal, and bicalutamide was discontinued. After 2 days of increasing liver function tests and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, the patient developed tachycardia and hypotension that was resistant to fluid resuscitation. Multiorgan damage was manifested by an alanine aminotransferase level greater than 40 times the upper limit of normal, serum creatinine concentration of 4.2 mg/dl, and troponin I level of 18 ng/ml. The patient died 8 days after bicalutamide therapy was begun secondary to multiorgan failure, most likely as a result of fulminant hepatotoxicity. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale showed a probable (score of 5) causal relationship between bicalutamide and fulminant hepatotoxicity. Fulminant hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect of bicalutamide. Liver function tests should be monitored before and during bicalutamide therapy, even for patients who have previously completed a course of this therapy with no signs or symptoms of toxicity.",1

In all, 55 adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH were randomized to receive PTX at a dose of 400 mg three times a day (n = 26) or placebo (n = 29) over 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as improvement in histological features of NASH through reduction in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and/or hepatocellular ballooning as reflected by a decrease of ? 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS). After 1 year, intention-to-treat analysis showed a decrease of ? 2 points in the NAS in 38.5% of patients on PTX versus 13.8% of those on placebo (P = 0.036). Per protocol analysis, a decrease of ? 2 points in the NAS from baseline was observed in 50% of the patients on PTX versus 15.4% of those on placebo (P = 0.01). The mean change in NAS score from baseline was -1.6 in the PTX group, versus -0.1 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). PTX significantly improved steatosis (mean change in score -0.9 versus -0.04 with placebo, P < 0.001) and lobular inflammation (median change -1 versus 0 with placebo, P = 0.02). No significant effects in hepatocellular ballooning were observed. PTX also improved liver fibrosis (mean change in fibrosis score was -0.2 among those on PTX versus +0.4 among those on placebo, P = 0.038). Although not statistically significant (P = 0.17), improvement in fibrosis was observed in a greater proportion (35%) of patients in the PTX group compared to placebo (15%). Adverse effects were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: PTX improved histological features of NASH compared to placebo. PTX was well tolerated in patients with NASH.",1
2207,22555080,Rilpivirine: a second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor,"PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, dosage and administration, and place in therapy of rilpivirine are reviewed. SUMMARY: Rilpivirine is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adult patients not previously treated with antiretroviral therapy. Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A isoenzyme system. Therefore, providers should be cautious when administering drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of this pathway. Coadministration with CYP 3A inhibitors may lead to increased concentrations of rilpivirine, thereby increasing the risk of adverse effects. Coadministration with inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes or drugs that increase gastric pH may lead to decreased concentrations of rilpivirine, thus promoting virological failure or resistance to rilpivirine. Two Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trials compared rilpivirine with efavirenz in HIV-infected adults not previously treated with an antiretroviral. The investigators concluded that rilpivirine, when combined with two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, was noninferior to efavirenz for reaching the endpoint of confirmed virological response (HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL) in adults with HIV infection not previously treated with antiretroviral therapy. The most commonly reported adverse effects included depression, insomnia, headache, and rash. Rilpivirine is administered as a single 25-mg tablet given once daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in order to optimize efficacy and reduce resistance. CONCLUSION: Rilpivirine is a viable NNRTI for HIV-infected patients who have not previously received antiretroviral therapy.",1

A complete list of programs participating in the 2018 integrated interventional radiology match was collected using the online Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database and Electronic Residency Application Service. Residency program websites were evaluated for the presence of 19 variables related to resident education and recruitment, and the percent comprehensiveness of each website was calculated based on the number of variables present. The effect of program size and geographic region on website availability and comprehensiveness was assessed. Of the 69 programs participating in the 2018 match, 18 (26%) programs did not have any locatable website. Of the 51 programs with websites, 30 (59%) had stand-alone interventional radiology websites distinct from the associated diagnostic radiology website. Large programs were more likely to have a residency website than small programs (91% versus 54%, p=0.001). Across all categories, the mean website comprehensiveness was 33%. Mean website comprehensiveness of programs in the Midwest (43%) and Northeast (37%) was significantly greater than mean website comprehensiveness of programs in the West (19%) (p=0.005). Overall, 1 in 4 integrated interventional radiology residency programs did not have locatable websites. Many integrated interventional radiology residency websites lack important content variables. Efforts should be made to improve the residency websites and digital training resources for prospective interventional radiology applicants and to help showcase programs in the best light. ",0
2209,24859203,Effects of vedolizumab induction therapy for patients with Crohn's disease in whom tumor necrosis factor antagonist treatment failed,"""BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is an increasing need for new treatments for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in whom previous therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists has failed. We performed a placebo-controlled, phase 3, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab, an antibody against the integrin ?4?7, as induction therapy. METHODS: Patients with moderately to severely active CD (CD activity index [CDAI] score, 220-400 points) were assigned randomly to groups given vedolizumab (300 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary analysis involved 315 patients with previous TNF antagonist failure (ie, an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance of ?1 TNF antagonists); we determined the proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI, ?150 points) at week 6. Secondary analyses evaluated outcomes at weeks 6 and 10 in this population and in the overall population (N�= 416), which included patients naive to TNF antagonist therapy (n�= 101). RESULTS: Among patients who had experienced previous TNF antagonist failure, 15.2% of those given vedolizumab and 12.1% of those given placebo were in remission at week 6 (P�= .433). At week 10, a higher proportion of this population given vedolizumab was in remission (26.6%) than those given placebo (12.1%) (nominal P�= .001; relative risk, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.6). A higher proportion of patients with previous TNF antagonist failure given vedolizumab also had a CDAI-100 response (?100-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at week 6 than those given placebo (39.2% vs 22.3%; nominal P�= .001; relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5). Adverse event results were similar among all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab was not more effective than placebo in inducing clinical remission at week 6 among patients with CD in whom previous treatment with TNF antagonists had failed. The therapeutic benefits of vedolizumab in these patients were detectable at week 10. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01224171.""",1
2210,25562960,Host factor Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein inhibits replication of the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV)],"We investigated inhibition of Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) upon xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) and made a preliminary study of the mechanism of action. Using transfection, infection, western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that MOV10 inhibited XMRV replication. Using MOV10 overexpressed in viral producer cells, MOV10 was shown to reduce the infectivity of XMRV. MOV10 could be incorporated into XMRV, suggesting that MOV10 could undergo encapsidation by XMRV during viral assembly. MOV10 could also restrict the DNA production of XMRV in target cells. We found that the putative RNA-helicase domain of MOV10 maintained most of its XMRV inhibition. These results suggest that MOV10 could be required during the retroviral lifecycle. Perturbation of MOV10 disrupts the generation of infectious viral particles, suggesting that MOV10 has broad antiretroviral activity. Hence, MOV10 could be actively involved in host defense against retroviral infection. ",0
2211,25709706,Adherence to risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) requirements for monthly testing of liver function,"BACKGROUND: Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), as mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medications with the potential for harm, are increasingly incorporating rigid protocols for patient evaluation, but little is known about compliance with these programs. Despite the inherent limitations, data on administrative claims may provide an opportunity to investigate adherence to these programs. METHODS: We assessed adherence to liver function test (LFT) requirements included in the REMS program for bosentan through use of administrative claims. Patients observed in the Optum Research Database who were initiators of bosentan from November 20, 2001 to March 31, 2013 were included. Adherence to LFTs was calculated using pharmacy claims for bosentan dispensation and medical claims for laboratory services, and was assessed at the time of drug initiation and within specified time intervals throughout follow-up. RESULTS: Of 742 patients, 523 (70.5%) had >/=1 qualifying LFT. Among patients with >/=12 dispensations, claims for LFTs at individual dispensations were 53.2-64.0%. Median proportion of dispensations with >/=1 LFT was 0.8 among patients with >/=6 (interquartile range, 0.7-1.0) or >/=12 (0.7-0.9) dispensations. Adherence was 90-100% for 33.3% of all initiators, whereas 29.3% of initiators were non-adherent (defined as <50% of on-therapy LFTs). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of administrative claims suggest that the REMS program for bosentan may not have adequately guaranteed adherence to the program's monthly monitoring of LFTs. Such investigations of existing REMS programs may provide insight on how to accomplish more successful evaluation of REMS.",1
2212,2930715,Oral contraceptives and primary liver cancer,"The relative risk for developing primary liver cancer in northern Italian users of oral contraceptives, compared to matched controls was calculated based on reported cases in hospitals in the greater Milan area from 1984-1987. The incidence of and mortality from primary liver cancer, as well as the prevalence of oral contraceptive usage, have both been rising to Italy since the late 1950s. 21 cases of liver cancer, in women aged 32-59 (median 50), occurred in the Milan area during the study period. These women, and 145 controls matched for age but admitted to hospitals for a variety of non-neoplastic diseases, were interviewed with a structured questionnaire covering socio-demographics, life style, diet, medical history, and history of use of oral contraceptives and other drugs. 19.0% of the cases had used oral contraceptives compared to 7.6% of controls, a relative risk of 1.8 for up to 5 years' use, and 8.3 for 5 years. History of hepatitis was associated with 14% of cases and 7% of controls. Italians have a higher incidence of liver neoplasms that northern Europeans and Americans, probably because of higher incidence of risk factors, such as hepatitis and alcohol use. The attributable risk for oral contraception, however, is lower in this population.",1
2213,22241104,Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency,"The urea cycle consists of six consecutive enzymatic reactions that convert waste nitrogen into urea. Deficiencies of any of these enzymes of the cycle result in urea cycle disorders (UCDs), a group of inborn errors of hepatic metabolism that often result in life-threatening hyperammonemia. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) catalyzes the fourth reaction in this cycle, resulting in the breakdown of argininosuccinic acid to arginine and fumarate. ASL deficiency (ASLD) is the second most common UCD, with a prevalence of ~1 in 70,000 live births. ASLD can manifest as either a severe neonatal-onset form with hyperammonemia within the first few days after birth or as a late-onset form with episodic hyperammonemia and/or long-term complications that include liver dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, and hypertension. These long-term complications can occur in the absence of hyperammonemic episodes, implying that ASL has functions outside of its role in ureagenesis and the tissue-specific lack of ASL may be responsible for these manifestations. The biochemical diagnosis of ASLD is typically established with elevation of plasma citrulline together with elevated argininosuccinic acid in the plasma or urine. Molecular genetic testing of ASL and assay of ASL enzyme activity are helpful when the biochemical findings are equivocal. However, there is no correlation between the genotype or enzyme activity and clinical outcome. Treatment of acute metabolic decompensations with hyperammonemia involves discontinuing oral protein intake, supplementing oral intake with intravenous lipids and/or glucose, and use of intravenous arginine and nitrogen-scavenging therapy. Dietary restriction of protein and dietary supplementation with arginine are the mainstays in long-term management. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is best considered only in patients with recurrent hyperammonemia or metabolic decompensations resistant to conventional medical therapy.",1

2215,29906667,The high cost of critical care unit over-utilization for patients with NSTE ACS,"There is substantial variability among hospitals in critical care unit (CCU) utilization for patients admitted with non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes (NSTE ACS). We estimated the potential cost saving if all hospitals adopted low CCU utilization practices for patients with NSTE ACS. National hospital claims data were used to identify all patients with a primary diagnosis of NSTE ACS initially admitted to an acute care hospital between 2007 and 2013. Hospital CCU utilization was classified as low (<30%), medium (30-70%), or high (>70%). Among the 270,564 NSTE ACS hospitalizations (71.6% non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; 28.4% unstable angina) admitted to 261 hospitals, 41.9% (inter-hospital range 0.3%-95.1%) were admitted to a CCU. The proportion of patients admitted to a CCU in low, medium and high utilization hospitals was 16.3%, 49.5%, and high 81.1%, respectively. No differences in adjusted inpatient mortality were observed by hospital CCU utilization. The overall inpatient costs of caring for NSTE ACS were $1.1 billion. CCU care accounted for 45.2% of all hospitalization costs including 22.6%, 49.9%, and 69.0% (P < .001) of costs in low, medium and high utilization centers. The national potential direct cost savings of medium and high CCU utilization centers adopting low NSTE ACS CCU utilization practices was $113.4 million over the study period. In a population-based contemporary cohort, CCU utilization for patients with NSTE ACS varied widely and in-hospital mortality was similar between low, medium and high utilization centers. CCU care accounted for 45% of hospitalization costs; thus, implementing policies and admission practices to align hospital resources with patient care needs have the potential to reduce overall health care costs.

2216,25424850,"""The high-dose aldesleukin """"select"""" trial: a trial to prospectively validate predictive models of response to treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma""","""PURPOSE: High-dose aldesleukin (HD IL2) received FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) in 1992, producing a 14% objective response rate (ORR) and durable remissions. Retrospective studies suggested that clinical and pathologic features could predict for benefit. The Cytokine Working Group conducted this prospective trial to validate proposed predictive markers of response to HD IL2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Standard HD IL2 was administered to prospectively evaluate whether the ORR of patients with mRCC with """"good"""" predictive pathologic features based on an """"integrated selection"""" model [ISM (e.g., clear-cell histology subclassification and carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA-9) IHC staining] was significantly higher than the ORR of a historical, unselected population. Archived tumor was collected for pathologic analysis including tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty eligible patients were enrolled between June 11 and September 7; 70% were Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) intermediate risk, 96% had clear cell RCC, and 99% had prior nephrectomy. The independently assessed ORR was 25% (30/120, 95% CI, 17.5%-33.7%, P = 0.0014; 3 complete responses, 27 partial responses) and was higher than a historical ORR. Thirteen patients (11%) remained progression free at 3 years and the median overall survival was 42.8 months. ORR was not statistically different by ISM classification (""""good-risk"""" 23% vs. """"poor-risk"""" 30%; P = 0.39). ORR was positively associated with tumor PD-L1 expression (P = 0.01) by IHC. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, biomarker validation study, HD IL2 produced durable remissions and prolonged survival in both """"good"""" and """"poor-risk"""" patients. The proposed ISM was unable to improve the selection criteria. Novel markers (e.g., tumor PD L1 expression) appeared useful, but require independent validation.""",1
2217,10423207,Transplant pharmacists' opinions on generic product selection of critical-dose drugs,"Factors considered important by transplant pharmacists in decisions about generic product selection and in defining critical-dose drugs, as well as transplant pharmacists' attitudes about bioequivalence testing, were studied. Surveys, completed by telephone and fax in 1997, were used to assess pharmacists' role at solid-organ transplant centers, factors the pharmacists considered important for generic product selection, and pharmacists' attitudes about the FDA guidelines on bioequivalence testing. Surveys were completed by 59 pharmacists. The factors considered important by pharmacists for inclusion of generic products on the formulary were safety (97% of respondents), clinical consequences (97%), efficacy (92%), and bioequivalence (92%). Nearly all the pharmacists (95%) expressed a belief that generic products of some critical-dose drugs should not be dispensed. Only 12% of the respondents said they thought that the FDA guidelines on bioequivalence testing were appropriate for critical-dose drugs, and 92% thought that bioequivalence testing for this category of drugs should be conducted in actual patients. Efficacy, safety, the presence of a narrow therapeutic index, bioequivalence, and clinical consequences were identified by transplant pharmacists as important factors in decisions about generic product selection; current FDA guidelines for establishing bioequivalence were viewed as possibly not appropriate for critical-dose drugs.

2218,24323774,Perfusion/Diffusion mismatch is valid and should be used for selecting delayed interventions,"The mismatch between a larger perfusion lesion and smaller diffusion lesion on magnetic resonance imaging is a validated signal of the ischemic penumbra, namely the region at risk in acute ischemic stroke that is critically hypoperfused and the target of reperfusion therapies. Clinical trials have shown strong correlations between reperfusion in mismatch patients and improved clinical outcomes. Attenuation of infarct growth is associated with reperfusion and corresponding clinical gains. Using computed tomography perfusion, the mismatch between relative cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood volume and perfusion delay is a comparable penumbral marker. Automated techniques allow rapid quantitative assessment of mismatch with thresholding to exclude benign oligemia. The penumbra is often present beyond the current 4.5-h time window, defined for the use of intravenous tPA. Treatment beyond this time point remains investigational. Although the efficacy of thrombolysis in mismatch patients requires further validation in randomized trials, there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that advanced neuroimaging of mismatch should be used for selection of delayed therapies in phase 3 trials.

This study investigated rasagiline efficacy and safety in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations. METHODS: In an 18-week, double-blind, multicentre (74 hospitals and academic centres in Israel, Argentina, and Europe) trial, 687 outpatients were randomly assigned to oral rasagiline (231 individuals; 1 mg once daily), entacapone (227; 200 mg with every levodopa dose), or placebo (229). Primary outcome was change in total daily off-time (intention-to-treat population). Other measures included the clinical global improvement (CGI) score and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 88 (13%) patients who were assigned treatment did not complete the study (23 rasagiline, 30 entacapone, 35 placebo), mainly because of withdrawal of consent (n=34) and adverse events (n=34). Both rasagiline and entacapone reduced mean daily off-time (-1.18 h rasagiline and -1.2 h entacapone vs placebo -0.4 h; p=0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively) and increased daily on-time without troublesome dyskinesia (0.85 h vs placebo 0.03 h; p=0.0005 for both). We recorded significant mean improvements in CGI scores (-0.86 rasagiline and -0.72 entacapone vs -0.37 placebo; p<0.0001, p=0.0002, respectively). Changes in UPDRS scores also significantly improved for activities of daily living during off-time (-1.71 and -1.38 vs placebo; p<0.0001, p=0.0006, respectively) and motor function during on-time (-2.94 and -2.73 vs placebo; both p<0.0001).

2221,23810788,The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor niraparib (MK4827) in BRCA mutation carriers and patients with sporadic cancer: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial,"""BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is implicated in DNA repair and transcription regulation. Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function. We investigated the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and preliminary antitumour activity of niraparib. METHODS: In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled patients with advanced solid tumours at one site in the UK and two sites in the USA. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less; had assessable disease; were not suitable to receive any established treatments; had adequate organ function; and had discontinued any previous anticancer treatments at least 4 weeks previously. In part A, cohorts of three to six patients, enriched for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, received niraparib daily at ten escalating doses from 30 mg to 400 mg in a 21-day cycle to establish the maximum tolerated dose. Dose expansion at the maximum tolerated dose was pursued in 15 patients to confirm tolerability. In part B, we further investigated the maximum tolerated dose in patients with sporadic platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer and sporadic prostate cancer. We obtained blood, circulating tumour cells, and optional paired tumour biopsies for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Toxic effects were assessed by common toxicity criteria and tumour responses ascribed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Circulating tumour cells and archival tumour tissue in prostate patients were analysed for exploratory putative predictive biomarkers, such as loss of PTEN expression and ETS rearrangements. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00749502. FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2008, and Jan 14, 2011, we enrolled 100 patients: 60 in part A and 40 in part B. 300 mg/day was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxic effects reported in the first cycle were grade 3 fatigue (one patient given 30 mg/day), grade 3 pneumonitis (one given 60 mg/day), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (two given 400 mg/day). Common treatment-related toxic effects were anaemia (48 patients [48%]), nausea (42 [42%]), fatigue (42 [42%]), thrombocytopenia (35 [35%]), anorexia (26 [26%]), neutropenia (24 [24%]), constipation (23 [23%]), and vomiting (20 [20%]), and were predominantly grade 1 or 2. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 36?4 h (range 32?8-46?0). Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed PARP inhibition exceeded 50% at doses greater than 80 mg/day and antitumour activity was documented beyond doses of 60 mg/day. Eight (40% [95% CI 19-64]) of 20 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with ovarian cancer had RECIST partial responses, as did two (50% [7-93]) of four mutation carriers with breast cancer. Antitumour activity was also reported in sporadic high-grade serous ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. We recorded no correlation between loss of PTEN expression or ETS rearrangements and measures of antitumour activity in patients with prostate cancer. INTERPRETATION: A recommended phase 2 dose of 300 mg/day niraparib is well tolerated. Niraparib should be further assessed in inherited and sporadic cancers with homologous recombination DNA repair defects and to target PARP-mediated transcription in cancer.

2222,12171680,Analysis of laboratory data in acne patients treated with isotretinoin: is there really a need to perform routine laboratory tests?,"INTRODUCTION: Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Serum levels of liver enzymes and lipids are carried out as a routine in most clinics both before and during treatment. AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the effect of isotretinoin on serum lipids, liver function and other laboratory parameters in order to assess the necessity to perform routine laboratory tests. METHODS: Computerized medical files of 1292 patients in private practice that received isotretinoin for acne were analyzed. RESULTS: 907 patients completed a treatment course of 5 to 9 months. Serum levels of liver enzymes were not elevated to a degree necessitating discontinuation of treatment. Only 1.5% of the patients had serum triglyceride levels above 400 mg%. No laboratory abnormalities were a cause for discontinuation of treatment. During a 6-year follow up only 3.5% of patients received a second course of therapy with isotretinoin. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. It should be prescribed for any inflammatory acne and in our opinion there is no need for a routine laboratory follow-up in young, healthy patients aside from a pregnancy test in females. At present, isotretinoin should be considered as the drug of choice for moderate to severe acne.",1

2224,29342379,Elimination of Cost Sharing for Screening Mammography in Medicare Advantage Plans,"BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most insurers and the Medicare program to eliminate cost sharing for screening mammography. METHODS: We conducted a difference-in-differences study of biennial screening mammography among 15,085 women 65 to 74 years of age in 24 Medicare Advantage plans that eliminated cost sharing to provide full coverage for screening mammography, as compared with 52,035 women in 48 matched control plans that had and maintained full coverage. RESULTS: In plans that eliminated cost sharing, adjusted rates of biennial screening mammography increased from 59.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9 to 65.0) in the 2-year period before cost-sharing elimination to 65.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 69.0) in the 2-year period thereafter. In control plans, the rates of biennial mammography were 73.1% (95% CI, 69.2 to 77.0) and 72.8% (95% CI, 69.7 to 76.0) during the same periods, yielding a difference in differences of 5.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.0 to 8.4). The difference in differences was 9.8 percentage points (95% CI, 4.5 to 15.2) among women living in the areas with the highest quartile of educational attainment versus 4.3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 8.4) among women in the lowest quartile. As indicated by the difference-in-differences estimates, after the elimination of cost sharing, the rate of biennial mammography increased by 6.5 percentage points (95% CI, 3.7 to 9.4) for white women and 8.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.5 to 14.4) for black women but was almost unchanged for Hispanic women (0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.3 to 8.1). CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of cost sharing for screening mammography under the ACA was associated with an increase in rates of use of this service among older women for whom screening is recommended. The effect was attenuated among women living in areas with lower educational attainment and was negligible among Hispanic women. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging.).",0

To induce GVHR, C57BL/6 (B6) spleen cells were injected twice into either (B6 x bm12)F1 (class-II-disparate), (B6 x bm1)F1 (class-I-disparate) or (bm1 x bm12)F1 mice (class-I + II-disparate). For comparison, (C57BL/10 x DBA/2)F1 (BDF1) mice injected with DBA/2 spleen cells were also used. (B6 x bm12)F1 and BDF1 recipients showed marked elevation of anti-DNA antibodies, circulating immune complexes (CIC) and the number of immunoglobulin producing cells (IgPC). At 20 weeks after cell injection, severe immune complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) was observed in (B6 x bm12)F1 recipients, but was far less severe in (bm1 x bm12)F1 recipients and was not observed in (B6 x bm1)F1 recipients. ICGN was also observed in BDF1 recipients at 12 weeks after cell injection. By immunofluorescent microscopy, IC deposition was detected along the capillary loops and also in the mesangial area in (B6 x bm12)F1 recipients, while BDF1 recipients showed only a capillary pattern. By light microscopy, the renal lesion of (B6 x bm12)F1 recipients appeared similar to those of BDF1 recipients. Histologically, (B6 x bm12)F1 recipients serve as a good model for lupus glomerulonephritis induced by class-II-disparate GVHR. ",0

Reports of death events submitted between January 2004 and December 2010 were retrieved and analysed by the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The ROR of case/non-case reports of death associated with an entacapone-containing drug combination was compared with the levodopa/carbidopa combination using the FDA AERS database. Eighty-seven reports linked the entacapone-containing drug combination to death, compared to 27 reports of death linking the levodopa/carbidopa combination. The ROR was statistically significant for the association between deaths with the use of an entacapone-containing drug combination (1.86 [95% CI 1.50-2.31]). In contrast, the ROR of death associated with the combination of levodopa and carbidopa was not statistically significant (0.89 [95% CI 0.61-1.30)]. Based on analysing reports in the FAERS database, there is a risk of death with the use of an entacapone-containing drug combination. These results generated a signal of death with the use of this drug. However, epidemiological studies are required to confirm this association.  ",0

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. METHODS: This multicentre, international, open-label, exploratory, randomised controlled phase 2B trial (LUX-Lung 7) was done at 64 centres in 13 countries. Treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or gefitinib (250 mg per day) until disease progression, or beyond if deemed beneficial by the investigator. Randomisation, stratified by EGFR mutation type and status of brain metastases, was done centrally using a validated number generating system implemented via an interactive voice or web-based response system with a block size of four. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival by independent central review, time-to-treatment failure, and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466660. FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2011, and Aug 8, 2013, 319 patients were randomly assigned (160 to afatinib and 159 to gefitinib). Median follow-up was 27?3 months (IQR 15?3-33?9). Progression-free survival (median 11?0 months [95% CI 10?6-12?9] with afatinib vs 10?9 months [9?1-11?5] with gefitinib; hazard ratio [HR] 0?73 [95% CI 0?57-0?95], p=0?017) and time-to-treatment failure (median 13?7 months [95% CI 11?9-15?0] with afatinib vs 11?5 months [10?1-13?1] with gefitinib; HR 0?73 [95% CI 0?58-0?92], p=0?0073) were significantly longer with afatinib than with gefitinib. Overall survival data are not mature. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (20 [13%] of 160 patients given afatinib vs two [1%] of 159 given gefitinib) and rash or acne (15 [9%] patients given afatinib vs five [3%] of those given gefitinib) and liver enzyme elevations (no patients given afatinib vs 14 [9%] of those given gefitinib). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (11%) patients in the afatinib group and seven (4%) in the gefitinib group. Ten (6%) patients in each group discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events. 15 (9%) fatal adverse events occurred in the afatinib group and ten (6%) in the gefitinib group. All but one of these deaths were considered unrelated to treatment; one patient in the gefitinib group died from drug-related hepatic and renal failure. INTERPRETATION: Afatinib significantly improved outcomes in treatment-naive patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC compared with gefitinib, with a manageable tolerability profile. These data are potentially important for clinical decision making in this patient population. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.""",1
2231,3767121,Isoniazid prophylaxis in hepatitis B carriers,"Both tuberculosis and hepatitis B are endemic in southeast Asia and are common among refugees to the United States from that region. Isoniazid, used for the prophylactic treatment of tuberculosis, is a potentially hepatotoxic drug. Carriers of the hepatitis B virus are likely to have some degree of liver damage due to their chronic infection. We hypothesized that prophylactic treatment of carriers with isoniazid would cause greater liver damage, as measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, than would such therapy of noncarriers. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the southeast Asian refugee population in Philadelphia failed to support this hypothesis. Isoniazid did not cause greater hepatotoxicity in hepatitis B carriers than in noncarriers. Although carriers had higher ALT levels than noncarriers, both groups experienced transient ALT elevations during the first 2 months of isoniazid prophylactic therapy. Therefore, we concluded that chronic infection with hepatitis B virus is not a contraindication to the prophylactic use of isoniazid.",1

2233,18343849,The block to membrane fusion differs with the site of ligand insertion in modified retroviral envelope proteins,"Efforts to achieve cell type-specific transduction of retroviral vectors for gene therapy have centred on modification of the envelope protein (Env). Typically, addition of a ligand to Env gives binding to the new or target receptor, but little or no infection, and affects the subunit association of the modified Env. We previously discovered two point mutations that increase targeted infection by over 1000-fold when added to an Env modified by N-terminal insertion of the receptor-binding domain from amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env. Here, we asked whether these mutations would similarly increase transduction by Env modified with a clinically relevant ligand, human interleukin-13 (IL-13L). Addition of the point mutations stabilized the weak subunit association observed in some IL-13L-modified Env proteins, but infection via the target IL-13 receptor still did not occur. Fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays and studies with a membrane-curving agent revealed that defects in membrane fusion differed with the site of ligand insertion. When IL-13 was inserted into the N terminus of Env, membrane fusion was blocked prior to membrane-lipid mixing, regardless of whether flanking flexible linkers were added. Unexpectedly, insertion of IL-13 in the proline-rich region showed evidence of initiation of fusion and fusion-peptide exposure, but fusion was blocked at a subsequent step prior to fusion-pore formation. Thus, the site of ligand insertion influenced initiation of membrane fusion and its progression. These observations suggest that a novel site for ligand insertion must be identified before clinically useful targeted transduction will be achieved. ",0
2234,17407625,Comparison of bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate in the treatment of chronic constipation,"""BACKGROUND: Chronic constipation is a widespread condition. Although laxatives are generally accepted as being effective treatments, few studies have made formal comparisons of their efficacy and safety in chronic use. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate in the treatment of chronic constipation over a 4-week period. METHODS: Patients with chronic constipation (N = 144), recruited from out-patient clinics, were analysed for safety and efficacy in this open-label, randomised, parallel-group study. Patients were treated daily for 4 weeks (bisacodyl, 5-10 mg daily: 70 patients; sodium picosulphate, 5-10 mg daily: 74 patients). Primary efficacy criteria consisted of the number of bowel movements and stool consistency. Secondary efficacy criteria were straining at stool and physicians' global efficacy assessment. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, tolerability and changes in laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Both treatments were equally effective in treating chronic constipation, providing sustained improvement in symptoms. Compared to baseline, there were significant (p < 0.001) improvements in stool frequency and consistency and in the occurrence of straining at 14 and 28 days for both treatment groups. Based on the physicians' global assessment, a significant improvement was observed in 74.6% (bisacodyl) and 79.2% (sodium picosulphate) of patients. Neither treatment had significant effects on serum electrolytes. There was a trend for better tolerability in patients receiving bisacodyl treatment based on the number of drug-related adverse events (bisacodyl: 7; sodium picosulphate: 14, two patients withdrawn). CONCLUSIONS: Bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate are equally well tolerated and effective in the treatment of chronic constipation over a 4-week period.""",1

2236,28941769,"A neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative model of prenatal and postpartum depression","A large body of evidence indicates that major affective disorders are accompanied by activated neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO&NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto)immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine, leaky gut and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO&NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO&NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO&NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general. This review provides a new IO&NS model of prenatal and postpartum depression. ",0

We did a randomised, controlled, phase III trial (TITAN) to compare 48-week efficacy and safety of darunavir-ritonavir with that of lopinavir-ritonavir in treatment-experienced, lopinavir-naive patients. METHODS: Patients received optimised background regimen plus non-blinded treatment with darunavir-ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily or lopinavir-ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority (95% CI lower limit for the difference in treatment response -12% or greater) for HIV RNA of less than 400 copies per mL in plasma at week 48 (per-protocol analysis). TITAN (TMC114-C214) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00110877. FINDINGS: Of 595 patients randomised and treated, 187 (31%) were protease inhibitor naive; 476 of 582 (82%) were susceptible to four or more protease inhibitors. At week 48, significantly more darunavir-ritonavir than lopinavir-ritonavir patients had HIV RNA of less than 400 copies per mL (77% [220 of 286] vs 68% [199 of 293]; estimated difference 9%, 95% CI 2-16). Fewer virological failures treated with darunavir-ritonavir than with lopinavir-ritonavir developed primary protease inhibitor mutations (21% [n=6] vs 36% [n=20]) and nucleoside analogue-associated mutations (14% [n=4] vs 27% [n=15]). Safety data were generally similar between the groups; grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 80 (27%) darunavir-ritonavir and 89 (30%) lopinavir-ritonavir patients. INTERPRETATION: In lopinavir-naive, treatment-experienced patients, darunavir-ritonavir was non-inferior to lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in terms of our virological endpoint, and should therefore be considered as a treatment option for this population.""",1
2239,6479871,Liquid crystalline phase formation by cholesterol in aqueous fatty acid salt solutions,"The interaction of cholesterol with fatty acid salt solutions was investigated as a potential method for gallstone dissolution. In the presence of sodium oleate or laurate, crystalline cholesterol was rapidly converted into a lamellar liquid crystalline phase. Analysis of the mesophase showed that it contained approximately equimolar amounts of the lipid components, although water was the major constituent. The rate of conversion of cholesterol to mesophase was determined from a compressed disc immersed in a stirred solution, as if it were a simple dissolution process. The apparent rate of solubilization was independent of oleate concentration in the 2.5 to 10% range and was approximately 200 times faster than micellar dissolution of cholesterol in 5% sodium cholate. A mechanism is proposed in which the rate-limiting step in mesophase formation is dispersion of liquid crystalline fragments into the bulk medium.",0

It was determined that partitioning of steroid hormones (SH) between the aqueous medium and the surfaces of lipoproteins (LP) was the initial (first order) SH-LP interaction. For some SH, especially dehydroepiandrosterone, significant second order interactions, which may involve chemical conversions, were detected. The first order binding values of the twelve SH with three LP were combined with the corresponding binding values of SH with sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and albumin in a 6 X 12 matrix.

The rate of CR was 52%. Maintenance therapy was very simple and the only association with stanozolol during this period suggested to us that an androgen, at low dosages, might be responsible for the unusual long-term survival time (45 months with a 95% confidence limit from 30 to 86 months). On the basis of our first observation, high dosages of the androgen were used during the induction phase of treatment but failed to demonstrate any advantage when associated with a drug regimen, including cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The reevaluation of each parameter for our group of patients did not allow selection of patients in terms of their age or the hematologic data obtained at presentation. Effects of androgen on the socalled normal hemopoietic cells and on the leukemic cells are discussed, particularly the possible antagonistic effect with ARA-C.

2243,15639300,Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"""Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, which has a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects on various key effector cells involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The therapeutic ratio for PDE4 inhibitors is thought to be determined by selectivity on receptor subtypes for relative effects on PDE4B (anti-inflammatory) and PDE4D (emesis). The two main orally active PDE4 inhibitors in the late phase III of clinical development are cilomilast and roflumilast; the latter (and its active metabolite N-oxide) is more selective and potent with a superior therapeutic ratio. Studies on cilomilast in COPD based on bronchial biopsy material have shown a broad range of anti-inflammatory activity, and the available evidence on clinical outcomes for up to 6 months with cilomilast 15 mg twice daily and roflumilast 500 mug once daily have shown variable but significant effects on exacerbations and quality of life, with small improvements in measures of pulmonary function. Roflumilast has a better safety and tolerability profile than cilomilast, with the main adverse effects being nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Roflumilast also has activity in asthma as assessed by its attenuation of allergen and exercise challenges, and it shows clinical efficacy equivalent to that of beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mug daily. The emerging results of clinical trials on PDE4 inhibitors in asthma and COPD should be interpreted with cautious optimism since much of the evidence has been published only in abstract form to date. The next few years should resolve important issues about the potential role of these drugs as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma and COPD and their place in management guidelines. Ultimately, clinicians will want to know whether PDE4 inhibitors are anything more than expensive """"designer"""" theophylline, the archetypal non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor.""",1

This commentary will elaborate on key points that academic departments must recognize and incorporate into their functional and organizational imperatives in order to remain successful with regard to physician recruitment and retention. Recognition of differences between newer-generation vs. established physician issues and concerns include differences in: learning style, teaching style, approach to clinical schedules and the concept of life-work balance, academic and personal motivation, desire for control of their work experience, effective productivity incentives, as well as communication style issues and implications thereof. The spectrum of physicians who contribute to the impact of these factors on contemporary academic anesthesiology departments include faculty, nonfaculty staff physicians, residents and medical students. Academic departments of anesthesiology which can successfully incorporate the changes and most importantly the functional and organizational flexibility needed to respond to the newer generations' worldview and so-called balanced goals will be able to best attract high-caliber housestaff and future faculty.

2245,28104635,Transverse Sinus Stenosis Is the Most Sensitive MR Imaging Correlate of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,"Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension have transverse sinus stenosis on gadolinium-bolused MRV, but other MR imaging signs are less consistently seen. Our aim was to demonstrate that transverse sinus stenosis could be identified on conventional MR imaging, and this identification would allow improved diagnostic sensitivity to this condition. MR imaging and MRV images from 63 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and 96 controls were reviewed by using 3 independent procedures. MRV images were graded for the presence and degree of stenosis of the transverse sinus. Postgadolinium coronal T1-weighted sequences were evaluated independent of MRV. The dimensions of the proximal and distal transverse sinus were measured from the MRV examinations, and the cross-sectional area of the transverse sinus was calculated. Correlation among the 3 modes of evaluation of the transverse sinus was conducted by using Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson, and Spearman ρ nonparametric statistical techniques. Transverse sinus stenosis was identified bilaterally on MRV in 94% of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and in 3% of controls. On coronal T1 postgadolinium MR images, transverse sinus stenosis was identified in 83% of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and 7% of controls. Previously described MR imaging signs of intracranial hypertension were identified in 8%-61% of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Correlation among the 3 modes of evaluation was highly significant ( Even without the assistance of an MRV sequence, neuroradiologists can validly identify bilateral transverse sinus stenosis in patients with intracranial hypertension more reliably than other previously described MR imaging findings in this condition. We conclude that transverse sinus stenosis is the most useful and sensitive imaging indicator of this disease state. ",0

It is not known whether this rate will increase if laypersons are trained to attempt defibrillation with the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). METHODS: We conducted a prospective, community-based, multicenter clinical trial in which we randomly assigned community units (e.g., shopping malls and apartment complexes) to a structured and monitored emergency-response system involving lay volunteers trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) alone or in CPR and the use of AEDs. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: More than 19,000 volunteer responders from 993 community units in 24 North American regions participated. The two study groups had similar unit and volunteer characteristics. Patients with treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the two groups were similar in age (mean, 69.8 years), proportion of men (67 percent), rate of cardiac arrest in a public location (70 percent), and rate of witnessed cardiac arrest (72 percent). No inappropriate shocks were delivered. There were more survivors to hospital discharge in the units assigned to have volunteers trained in CPR plus the use of AEDs (30 survivors among 128 arrests) than there were in the units assigned to have volunteers trained only in CPR (15 among 107; P=0.03; relative risk, 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 3.77); there were only 2 survivors in residential complexes. Functional status at hospital discharge did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Training and equipping volunteers to attempt early defibrillation within a structured response system can increase the number of survivors to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in public locations. Trained laypersons can use AEDs safely and effectively.",0

The search for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of lung cancer is important. Here, we reported that the AKT inhibitor perifosine and the MEK\ERK inhibitor MEK-162 synergistically induced lung cancer cell (A549 and H460 lines) growth inhibition and apoptosis. The combined efficiency was significantly higher than either agent alone. For the molecular study, perifosine and MEK-162 worked together to concurrently block AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), and MEK-ERK signalings in lung cancer cells, while either agent alone only affected one or two signalings with lower efficiency. In vivo, MEK-162 and perifosine co-administration dramatically inhibited A549 lung cancer xenograft growth, without inducing apparent toxicities. The synergistic activity in vivo was again superior than either agent alone. Thus, perifosine and MEK-162 combination is biologically plausible by acting through effects on different proliferation and survival-related signaling pathways. Our in vitro and in vivo results support the feasibility of investigating the synergism regimen in clinical tests.  ",0

His serum creatinine peaked at 1.12 mg/dL. An ibuprofen level drawn 7 h postingestion was 739.2 mg/L (therapeutic 5-49 mg/L). We describe a case of a massive ibuprofen overdose characterized by metabolic acidosis, coma, and a state of high urine output who survived with aggressive supportive care. This case is unique in several ways. First, ibuprofen levels this high have only rarely been described. Second, polyuria is very poorly described following ibuprofen ingestions.",1
2263,23647699,Graduated driver license nighttime compliance in U.S. teen drivers involved in fatal motor vehicle crashes,"Examination of teen driver compliance with graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws could be instrumental in identifying factors associated with persistently high motor vehicle mortality rates. Fatality analysis reporting system (FARS) data from the years 2006 to 2009 were used in this nation-wide cross-sectional study of drivers covered by a state nighttime GDL law (n=3492). A new definition of weekend, based on the school night in relation to the teenage social landscape, redefined Friday night as a weekend night and Sunday night as a weekday/school night and compared it to previous weekend definitions. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine independent effects of demographic, behavioral, environmental, contextual, and other factors on compliance with nighttime GDL laws. All analyses were performed in Stata version 11. Given coverage under nighttime GDL laws, drivers aged 15-17 years were non-compliant in 14.9% of the fatal MVCs in which they were involved, and nearly one-fifth (18.8%) of all fatalities aged 15-17 years were associated with non-compliance. Mortality risk was 10% higher using a revised social (school night) versus traditional (Sat-Sun) weekend definitions. In multivariable analysis, drivers non-compliant with nighttime GDL laws were more likely to be drinking (OR=4.97, 3.85-6.40), unbelted (OR=1.58, 1.25-1.99), driving on the weekend (OR=1.82, 1.47-2.24), and killed (OR=1.31, 1.04-1.65). GDL non-compliance contributes to teen motor vehicle mortality. Legislative and enforcement efforts targeting non-school night driving, seatbelt nonuse and alcohol have potential to further reduce teen driving mortality. ",0
2264,28230928,Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients of chronic hepatitis C with hepatitis B virus infection treated with direct acting antivirals,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) may reactivate when treating chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with direct acting antivirals (DAA). We aim to investigate the risk of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy. METHODS: Chronic hepatitis C patients receiving pan-oral DAA therapy from December 2013 to August 2016 were evaluated. Fifty-seven patients that had a past HBV infection (negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and positive hepatitis B core antibody) and seven patients that had a current HBV infection (positive HBsAg) were enrolled. Serum HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) markers were regularly measured. The endpoints were the HCV sustained virological response (SVR) and the HBV virological/clinical reactivation. RESULTS: The overall SVR(12) rate was 96.9%, and two patients, one with positive HBsAg, had a relapse of HCV. No episodes of HBV virological reactivation were observed among the patients with a past HBV infection. For the seven patients with a current HBV infection, HBV virological reactivation was found in four (57.1%) of the seven patients. Clinical reactivation of HBV was observed in one patient with pretreatment detectable HBV DNA and recovered after entecavir administration. For the other three patients with HBV virological reactivation, the reappearance of low level HBV DNA without clinical reactivation was observed. HBsAg levels demonstrated only small fluctuations in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a minimal impact of hepatitis B core antibody seropositivity on HCV efficacy and safety. For CHC patients with current HBV infection, the risk of HBV reactivation was present, and monitoring the HBV DNA level during therapy is warranted.",1
2265,15069221,Re-thinking accountability: trust versus confidence in medical practice,"In seeking to prevent a reoccurrence of scandals such as that involving cardiac surgery in Bristol, the UK government has adopted a model of regulation that uses rules and surveillance as a way of both improving the quality of care delivered and increasing confidence in healthcare institutions. However, this approach may actually act to reduce confidence and trust while also reducing the moral motivation of practitioners. Accountability in health care is discussed, and it is suggested that openness about the difficult dilemmas that arise when practitioners have a duty to be accountable to more than one audience may be an alternative means of restoring trust. A greater emphasis on the sharing of information between individual health professionals and their patients would increase trust and would allow patients to hold their doctors to account for the quality of care they receive. Concentrating more on developing trust by the sharing of information and less on the futile search for complete confidence in systems and rules may improve the quality of care delivered while also nurturing the moral motivation of professionals upon which the delivery of high quality health care depends.

2266,22432938,Non-genetic risk factors and predicting efficacy for docetaxel--drug-induced liver injury among metastatic breast cancer patients,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Docetaxel has been chosen as one of the most popular anticancer drugs in the treatment of breast cancer for more than a decade. There is increasingly awareness for the occurrence of docetaxel and/or docetaxel-drug-induced liver injury (DILI), although the underlying mechanism of occurrence and its risk factors remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to identify non-genetic risk factors for docetaxel-DILI among 647 metastasis breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel-containing regimens. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (10.36%) patients were diagnosed as docetaxel-DILI. By logistic regression analysis, premenopausal status (odds ratio [OR][95% confidence interval {CI}] = 2.24 [1.30-3.87]), past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (OR [95% CI] = 4.23 [1.57-11.42]), liver metastasis (OR [95% CI] = 3.70 [2.16-6.34]). The predominant occurrence of DILI was seen in groups with docetaxel combination regimens. (OR [95% CI] = 2.66 [1.59-4.55]). The potential increasing occurrence of docetaxel-DILI was associated with multiple risk factors in an exposure-response manner (P < 0.001), and patients with more than three risk factors would be exposed to a 36.61-fold risk of DILI (95% CI = 10.18-131.62). Further analysis by the risk score and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) showed that those four factors contributed to an AUC of 0.7536 (95% CI = 0.70-0.81), with a predictive sensitivity of 74.63% and specificity of 65.17%. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel-DILI with a relatively higher incidence should be addressed among metastatic breast cancer patients. Four predominant risk factors, including premenopausal status, past HBV infection, liver metastasis, and docetaxel combination regimens, were potential predicators for DILI.",1
2267,29174322,Comparison of Patient Survival Between Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Among Patients Eligible for Both Modalities,"Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) costs less to the health care system compared to in-center hemodialysis (HD), it is an underused therapy. Neither modality has been consistently shown to confer a clear benefit to patient survival. A key limitation of prior research is that study patients were not restricted to those eligible for both therapies. Retrospective cohort study. All adult patients developing end-stage renal disease from January 2004 to December 2013 at any of 7 regional dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada, who had received at least 1 outpatient dialysis treatment and had completed a multidisciplinary modality assessment. HD or PD. Mortality from any cause. Among all incident patients with end-stage renal disease (1,579 HD and 453 PD), PD was associated with lower risk for death among patients younger than 65 years. However, after excluding approximately one-third of all incident patients deemed to be ineligible for PD, the modalities were associated with similar survival regardless of age. This finding was also observed in analyses that were restricted to patients initiating dialysis therapy electively as outpatients. The impact of modality on survival did not vary over time. The determination of PD eligibility was based on the judgment of the multidisciplinary team at each dialysis center. HD and PD are associated with similar mortality among incident dialysis patients who are eligible for both modalities. The effect of modality on survival does not appear to change over time. Future comparisons of dialysis modality should be restricted to individuals who are deemed eligible for both modalities to reflect the outcomes of patients who have the opportunity to choose between HD and PD in clinical practice.

2268,3006073,Translation of open reading frame E5 of bovine papillomavirus is required for its transforming activity,"A series of mutations in open reading frame (ORF) E5 of bovine papillomavirus type 1 has been constructed to determine whether this putative gene is required for in vitro oncogenic transformation by viral DNA. Frameshift mutations at either of two different positions located exclusively in ORF E5 cause a substantial reduction in the ability of the cloned viral DNA to induce the appearance of transformed foci of mouse C127 cells. A genetic mapping experiment with one of the mutants indicates that this characteristic transformation defect is actually due to the constructed mutation in ORF E5. Analysis of 10 different mutants with sequence changes at a single position in the ORF showed that there is an exact correspondence between transformation-competence and the ability of the 3' half of ORF E5 to be correctly translated. The transformation defect of an ORF E5 frameshift mutant can be suppressed by a second mutation that restores the correct reading frame to most of the ORF, but not by one that restores the reading frame near the 3' end of the ORF. These results constitute strong genetic evidence that translation of ORF E5 is required for efficient transformation of mouse C127 cells by bovine papillomavirus DNA. Wild-type ORF E5 has the potential to encode a short hydrophobic protein or polypeptide domain. ",0
2269,12688327,Hepatosplenic T-gammadelta lymphoma in a patient with Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine,"Hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphoma (HS-gammadeltaTCL) is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which has been associated in some cases with immunosuppression, mainly after solid organ transplants. We describe a case of HSgammadeltaTCL with a leukaemic course in a patient with Crohn's disease who had received azathioprine during the previous 5.5 years. Sinusoidal infiltration by atypical lymphocytes was observed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and the typical cytogenetic abnormalities (isochromosome 7 and trisomy 8) were found. The patient did not respond to intensive chemotherapy. This case shows the importance of ruling out HSgammadeltaTCL in patients with hepatosplenomegaly, B-symptoms and any immunosuppressive condition.",1
2270,6243170,The use of lithium carbonate to reduce infection and leukopenia during systemic chemotherapy,"To investigate whether lithium ameliorates the infectious complications that accompany systemic chemotherapy, we studied 45 patients with small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma receiving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Twenty received lithium carbonate, and 25 received no additional therapy. Control subjects experienced more days with neutropenia than the lithium-treated group (2.17 days per 100 patient-days vs. 0.29), more severe febrile episodes (seven patients vs. one patient), more days hospitalized with fever and neutropenia (1.92 per 100 patient-days vs. 0.18), and more infection-related deaths (five vs. none). Infection-free survival was significantly longer in the lithium-treated group than in controls (P less than 0.05). Delay in subsequent chemotherapy was longer (P less than 0.01) and the number of dose reductions greater (P less than 0.01) in the control group. For both leukocytes and neutrophils, the first cycle nadir, mean of all treatment nadirs, and the lowest nadir observed during treatment were significantly higher in the lithium group. Mean mid-cycle monocyte counts were greater in the lithium group (P less than 0.05) and correlated with concurrent serum lithium levels (rs = 0.74, P less than 0.05). We believe that lithium carbonate shows promise as a means of lowering the risk of infection among patients receiving cytotoxic therapy.",0
2271,17523162,Bile salt-dependent efflux of cellular phospholipids mediated by ATP binding cassette protein B4,"Human ABCB4 (multidrug resistance [MDR]3 P-glycoprotein) is expressed in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte. ABCB4 has been shown to be required for phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion into the bile and to translocate PC across the plasma membrane. To further investigate the function of ABCB4, we established a cell line stably expressing ABCB4 (human embryonic kidney [HEK]/ABCB4). The efflux of phospholipids from HEK/ABCB4 cells was remarkably increased by the addition of taurocholate. In addition, the cholesterol efflux from HEK/ABCB4 cells was also enhanced in the presence of taurocholate. Light scattering measurements suggested that the taurocholate monomer plays an important role in ABCB4-mediated lipid secretion. On the other hand, the efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol was not mediated by ABCB1 (MDR1) even in the presence of taurocholate. Taurocholate promoted the efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol from HEK/ABCB4 cells more efficiently than glycocholate and cholate. ABCB4-K435M and ABCB4-K1075M, Walker A lysine mutants, did not mediate the phospholipid and cholesterol efflux in the presence of taurocholate, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is essential for the efflux. Verapamil completely inhibited the taurocholate-dependent efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol from HEK/ABCB4 cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that, in the presence of taurocholate, HEK/ABCB4 cells preferentially secreted PC compared to sphingomyelin. PC vesicles induced cholesterol diffusion from cell membrane, but did not accept cholesterol from ABCB4. CONCLUSION: ABCB4 mediates the efflux of phospholipids into the canalicular lumen in the presence of bile salts, and plays a crucial role in bile formation and lipid homeostasis.",0
2272,1618738,Effects of low culture temperature on the induction of hsp70 mRNA and the accumulation of hsp70 and hsp105 in mouse FM3A cells,"We have shown that heat shock does not induce the synthesis of hsp70 in FM3A cells maintained at a low culture temperature of 33 degrees C although it does so in cells maintained at 37 degrees C [T. Hatayama et al. (1991) Biochem. Int. 24, 467-474]. In this paper, we show that FM3A cells maintained at 37 degrees C produced hsp70 mRNA during continuous heating at 42 degrees C or during postincubation at either 37 or 33 degrees C after being heated at 45 degrees C for 15 min, whereas cells maintained at 33 degrees C did not produce hsp70 mRNA during continuous heating at 37, 39, 42, or 45 degrees C, or during postincubation after being heated at any temperature. Thus the lack of hsp70 synthesis in cells maintained at 33 degrees C seemed to be due to the absence of hsp70 mRNA induction. Also, hsp70 was accumulated in cells maintained at 37 degrees C during continuous heating at 42 degrees C and during postincubation at 37 degrees C after heat shock at 45 degrees C, but not during postincubation at 33 degrees C. The cellular level of the constitutive hsp73 as well as the mRNA level were both similar in cells maintained at 33 and 37 degrees C. On the other hand, the cellular level of the constitutive hsp105 in cells maintained at 33 degrees C was only half of that in cells maintained at 37 degrees C. These hsp105 levels increased significantly in both types of cells after continuous heating at 39 degrees C. These findings indicate that the culture temperature affects not only the induction of hsp70 mRNA but also the accumulation of hsp70 and hsp105 in the cells. ",0
2273,29901702,YebC controls virulence by activating T3SS gene expression in the pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida,"Edwardsiella piscicida is an infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes great losses to the aquaculture industry worldwide. Based on pattern analysis of conditional essentiality (PACE), a new method for transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) data analysis, we investigated the genome-wide genetic requirements during the dynamic process of infection and colonization in turbot in this study. As a result, disruption of ETAE_1437 was discovered to lead to substantially reduced colonization, which was similar to the in vivo dynamic patterns of the mutants of T3SS or T6SS. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that ETAE_1437 is a YebC/PmpR family regulator. Moreover, we found that ETAE_1437 not only regulated quorum sensing by directly binding to the edwR promoter region but also activated T3SS expression by directly binding to the promoter region of the T3SS gene ETAE_0873. In addition, ETAE_1437 mutants exhibited substantial colonization defects and significantly decreased virulence in turbot. Overall, this study identified ETAE_1437 as a novel virulence regulator in E. piscicida and enriched our understanding of the pathogenesis of E. piscicida in fish. We thus reannotated ETAE_1437 as YebC. ",0
2274,19582719,Upregulation of glycolytic enzymes in proteins secreted from human colon cancer cells with 5-fluorouracil resistance,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, resistance to this drug is a major obstacle in CRC chemotherapy. Accurate prediction of response to 5-FU would avoid unnecessary chemotherapy and allow the selection of other effective drugs. To identify a candidate predictor of 5-FU resistance, we isolated secreted proteins that were up- or downregulated in a 5-FU-resistant cancer cell line, compared with the parent cell line (SNU-C4), using a stable isotope-coded labeling protocol. For validating the clinical applicability of this method, levels of the identified proteins were determined in the sera of 46 patients treated with 5-FU. In total, 238 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 50 to 75 kDa were identified. Among these, 45 and 35 secreted proteins were up- and downregulated in the 5-FU-resistant cell line, respectively. We observed significant upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 (PK-M2), transketolase, and NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme 1. In particular, the level of PK-M2, a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, showed an increasing tendency in both sera and tissues from CRC patients displaying no response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy (progressive and stable disease cases), compared with that in complete or partial responders to 5-FU-based chemotherapy; however, it did not reach the statistical significance. In conclusion, increasing pattern of PK-M2 observed with 5-FU resistance induced in vitro and in sera and tissues from CRC patients displaying poor response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy suggest the relevance of dysregulated glycolysis and 5-FU-resistant CRC.

2275,24730465,Prospective long-term study of hepatitis B virus reactivation in patients with hematologic malignancy,"""BACKGROUND AND AIM: To elucidate the clinical characteristics of hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBV-R), we performed a prospective long-term study of patients with hematologic malignancy, including both hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and those with resolved HBV infection. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with hematopoietic stem-cell transplants (HSCT) and 36 patients given rituximab-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Entecavir was administered prophylactically to eight patients with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). HBV-DNA was measured every month in 49 patients with resolved HBV infection, and preemptive therapy was given to eight patients with HBV-R. RESULTS: HBV-R developed in five (26%) of 19 patients with HSCT and three (10%) of 30 patients given rituximab-based chemotherapy. HBV-R occurred a median of 3 months (range: 2-10) after the end of rituximab-based chemotherapy and 22 months (range: 9-36) after HSCT. HBV-R did not develop in patients with an antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) titer exceeding 200?mIU/mL at baseline. Mutations in the """"a"""" determinant region with amino acid replacement were detected in four of the eight patients with HBV-R. Preemptive therapy prevented severe hepatitis related to HBV-R. Entecavir treatment was stopped in four patients with HBV-R. Since the withdrawal of entecavir, HBV-DNA has not been detected in two patients persistently positive for anti-HBs. No patient had fatal hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Proper management of patients with HBsAg or resolved HBV infection prevented fatal hepatitis related to HBV-R in patients who received immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy. Entecavir could be safely discontinued in patients with HBV-R who had acquired anti-HBs.""",1
2276,20515399,Life-threatening complications of vitamin D intoxication due to over-the-counter supplements,"INTRODUCTION: Ninety percent of hypercalcemic cases are caused by primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. Less frequent causes are granulomatous diseases, drug-induced diseases, and intoxications. CASE REPORT: We present two women with life-threatening hypercalcemia due to the intake of vitamin D-concentrated supplements, which turned out to be 100-1,000 times higher than stated on the label of over-the-counter dietary supplements. Laboratory analysis revealed ionized calcium levels of 4.00 (16.00) and 4.56 mmol/L (18.24 mg/dL) with vitamin D(25) concentrations of 1,372 and 644 nmol/L, respectively. Apart from a patient with general symptoms of hypercalcemia, a case of refractory status epilepticus after correction of serum calcium levels, and in need of prolonged ICU treatment, is described. CONCLUSION: Initial drug-taking history in the presented cases did not reveal the use of over-the-counter supplements, which underlines the importance of a thorough evaluation of (non-)prescribed medication. Moreover, these supplements may contain higher levels of vitamin D than the label states. As a result, hypercalcemia may be an underlying cause for life-threatening complications, including a well-documented refractory status epilepticus.",1
2277,6849209,"Prospective, randomized comparison of metronidazole and clindamycin, each with gentamicin, for the treatment of serious intra-abdominal infection","Metronidazole (M) has potent bactericidal activity against anaerobic bacteria. This study was designed to compare its efficacy and safety when combined with gentamicin (M + G) to those of an accepted regimen, clindamycin plus gentamicin (C + G), for the treatment of intra-abdominal infection. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 500 mg of M or 600 to 800 mg of clindamycin (C) each combined with G, 1.5 mg/kg, all administered intravenously every 8 hours. Of 186 patients enrolled, 45 were excluded from analysis (22, M + G). Of the remaining 141 patients, 72 had been allocated to the M + G group. Data refer to M + G and C + G groups, respectively. Infections included abscess in 37 and 30 patients and peritonitis in 30 and 31. Appendicitis was the most common underlying disease, causing intra-abdominal infection in 21 and 22 patients, with diverticulitis occurring next most frequently, seven and 10 patients. Both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from abdominal pus in 32 and 27 patients, anaerobes alone in seven and four, and aerobes alone in 24 and 25. In six and seven patients, pus was not cultured. Anaerobic bacteremia occurred in 10/66 and 6/64 patients from whom blood was cultured. Patients were classified as cured, improved, or treatment failures. These ratios were 60:8:4 and 58:8:3. Median trough serum concentrations of M and C were 13.0 and 3.7 micrograms/ml, respectively, and at 15 minutes after infusion, 15 and 10.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. The frequencies of rash, diarrhea, and superinfection were not different in the two treatment groups although abnormal serum tests of liver function occurred more commonly in the C+G group. M+G and C+G are not different in efficacy and acceptability for the therapy of serious intra-abdominal infections in adults.",1

Thiazolidinediones, a commonly used drug class for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, have emerged as a potentially useful treatment for NAFLD. There are, however, lingering concerns about their potential toxicity as well as emerging concerns about how to monitor for and assess hepatotoxicity. We conducted a randomized, long-term, double-blind, hepatic safety study at 171 centres in the US in which 2097 patients with type 2 diabetes received either pioglitazone or glibenclamide (glyburide). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either pioglitazone (15-45 mg once daily) or glibenclamide (5-15 mg once daily) for 3 years. The primary objective was to evaluate drug-induced liver injury manifested by liver enzyme elevations, measured every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was a confirmed ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal (>3 x ULN) with a secondary endpoint of 8 x ULN. MAIN RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 1051 pioglitazone-treated and 1046 glibenclamide-treated patients; of these, 411 pioglitazone patients and 413 glibenclamide patients completed the study. The incidence of hepatocellular injury was 0 with pioglitazone and 4 (0.38%) with glibenclamide (p = 0.0617). Analyses of the secondary endpoints revealed no ALT >8 x ULN for pioglitazone versus 1 with glibenclamide (p = 0.4988); no ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin 2 x ULN with pioglitazone versus 1 with glibenclamide (p = 0.4988); and fewer ALT >3 x ULN single elevations with pioglitazone (n = 3) than with glibenclamide (n = 9; p = 0.0907). Significantly (p < or = 0.05) fewer cases of ALT >1.5 x ULN, aspartate aminotransferase >1.5 x ULN and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase >1.5 x ULN were seen with pioglitazone compared with glibenclamide. No case of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic failure was reported in either treatment group; two cases of hepatic cirrhosis with glibenclamide were reported. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an hepatic safety profile of pioglitazone similar to that of glibenclamide in long-term use in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

We reviewed the liver functions of 16 haematological patients with no previous liver disorders who received ATG as part of their pre-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) conditioning regimen, and the liver function tests of five SAA patients who received ATG as part of their treatment. Liver functions were evaluated at day -1 pre-, and days +3 and +10 post-ATG treatment. All patients had normal liver functions before treatment.

The mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels increased from 51.9 +/- 11.3 U to 184.6 +/- 74.6 U (n = 16; p < 0.036), and then declined to 121.9 +/- 61.3 U (n = 16; NS). The mean aspartate amino transferase (AST) levels increased from 31.2 + 5.7 U to 152.0 +/- 67.0 U (n = 16; p < 0.44) and then declined to 46.0 +/- 14 (n = 16; p < 0.049). The mean tau-glutamyltransferase (GTP) levels increased from 93.0 +/- 34 to 188.0 +/- 36 (n = 16; p < 0.02), and were 168.0 +/- 37.0 at day +10 (n = 16; NS). The mean bilirubin levels increased from 18.0 +/- 1.9 microM l(-1) to 22.7 +/- 2.8 (n = 16); NS), at day +3 and to 31.9 +/- 6.9 at day +10 (n = 16; NS).

2282,21248613,Thinking beyond the obvious: hepatotoxicity secondary to idiosyncratic depakote toxicity,"""Depakote-induced hepatotoxicity has been well established as an adverse effect, and periodic monitoring of drug level is often required. Depakote-induced hepatotoxicity mostly occurs at supratherapeutic drug level. Rarely, an idiosyncratic response is triggered, and hepatotoxicity can occur at the therapeutic drug level mostly in chronic users. Here, we describe a rare case of idiosyncratic depakote-induced hepatotoxicity. A 25-year-old female with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and Dandy Walker Syndrome presented with an unwitnessed seizure and altered mental status. The patient's medication list included zonisamide, depakote, and synthroid. She was noted to be lethargic, disoriented, nonverbal, but awake. An arterial blood gas examination showed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis. Blood work was consistent with hepatitis, hyperammonemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The Depakote level was therapeutic. Head computed tomography and liver ultrasound results were not significant. After ruling out all other causes and seeing improvement of parameters after the drug was discontinued, idiosyncratic depakote toxicity was diagnosed.

2283,25695775,Role of pentraxin 3 in shaping arthritogenic alphaviral disease: from enhanced viral replication to immunomodulation,"The rising prevalence of arthritogenic alphavirus infections, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and the lack of antiviral treatments highlight the potential threat of a global alphavirus pandemic. The immune responses underlying alphavirus virulence remain enigmatic. We found that pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was highly expressed in CHIKV and RRV patients during acute disease. Overt expression of PTX3 in CHIKV patients was associated with increased viral load and disease severity. PTX3-deficient (PTX3(-/-)) mice acutely infected with RRV exhibited delayed disease progression and rapid recovery through diminished inflammatory responses and viral replication. Furthermore, binding of the N-terminal domain of PTX3 to RRV facilitated viral entry and replication. Thus, our study demonstrates the pivotal role of PTX3 in shaping alphavirus-triggered immunity and disease and provides new insights into alphavirus pathogenesis. ",0

2285,29899502,Development of a consent resource for genomic data sharing in the clinical setting,"Data sharing between clinicians, laboratories, and patients is essential for improvements in genomic medicine, but obtaining consent for individual-level data sharing is often hindered by a lack of time and resources. To address this issue, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) developed tools to facilitate consent, including a one-page consent form and online supplemental video with information on key topics, such as risks and benefits of data sharing. To determine whether the consent form and video accurately conveyed key data sharing concepts, we surveyed 5,162 members of the general public. We measured comprehension at baseline, after reading the form and watching the video. Additionally, we assessed participants' attitudes toward genomic data sharing. Participants' performance on comprehension questions significantly improved over baseline after reading the form and continued to improve after watching the video. Results suggest reading the form alone provided participants with important knowledge regarding broad data sharing, and watching the video allowed for broader comprehension. These materials are now available at http://www.clinicalgenome.org/share . These resources will provide patients a straightforward way to share their genetic and health information, and improve the scientific community's access to data generated through routine healthcare.

2286,1143304,Protecting the medical commons: who is responsible?,"The resources for medical care are clearly finite, but demands on those resources are growing rapidly. Of particular concern are the demands on those resources for medical practices of three kinds: those that pose conflicts between the interests of the individual and those of society; those of no value or of undetermined value; and those for potentially preventable conditions. Such practices must be evaluated in terms of social and medical priorities, and this requirement will become more urgent with the establishment of national health insurance. Who will make decisions is less clear, but it is not likely to be physicians alone. It is imperative that physicians and other health providers work closely with professionals from many fields, and with consumers, to ensure the availability and dissemination of information that will permit decisions that are in the best interests of society.",0
2287,26202488,The effect of 8 or 5 years of denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: results from the FREEDOM Extension study,"""The FREEDOM study and its Extension provide long-term information about the effects of denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Treatment for up to 8 years was associated with persistent reduction of bone turnover, continued increases in bone mineral density, low fracture incidence, and a favorable benefit/risk profile. INTRODUCTION: This study aims to report the results through year 5 of the FREEDOM Extension study, representing up to 8 years of continued denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. METHODS: Women who completed the 3-year FREEDOM study were eligible to enter the 7-year open-label FREEDOM Extension in which all participants are scheduled to receive denosumab, since placebo assignment was discontinued for ethical reasons. A total of 4550 women enrolled in the Extension (2343 long-term; 2207 cross-over). In this analysis, women in the long-term and cross-over groups received denosumab for up to 8 and 5 years, respectively. RESULTS: Throughout the Extension, sustained reduction of bone turnover markers (BTMs) was observed in both groups. In the long-term group, mean bone mineral density (BMD) continued to increase significantly at each time point measured, for cumulative 8-year gains of 18.4 and 8.3 % at the lumbar spine and total hip, respectively. In the cross-over group, mean BMD increased significantly from the Extension baseline for 5-year cumulative gains of 13.1 and 6.2 % at the lumbar spine and total hip, respectively. The yearly incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures remained low in both groups. The incidence of adverse and serious adverse events did not increase over time. Through Extension year 5, eight events of osteonecrosis of the jaw and two events of atypical femoral fracture were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab treatment for up to 8 years was associated with persistent reductions of BTMs, continued BMD gains, low fracture incidence, and a consistent safety profile.""",1
2288,32286709,Functional consequences of metabolic zonation in murine livers: New insights for an old story,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Zone-dependent differences in the expression of metabolic enzymes along the porto-central axis of the acinus are a long-known feature of liver metabolism. A prominent example is the preferential localization of the enzyme glutamine synthetase in pericentral hepatocytes, where it converts potentially toxic ammonia to the valuable amino acid glutamine. However, with the exception of a few key regulatory enzymes, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of zonal differences in the abundance of metabolic enzymes and much more importantly, an estimation of the associated functional differences between portal and central hepatocytes is missing thus far. APPROACH & RESULTS: We addressed this problem by establishing a new method for the separation of periportal and pericentral hepatocytes that yields sufficiently pure fractions of both cell populations. Quantitative shotgun proteomics identified hundreds of differentially expressed enzymes in the two cell populations. We used zone-specific proteomics data for scaling of the maximal activities to generate portal and central instantiations of a comprehensive kinetic model of central hepatic metabolism (Hepatokin1). CONCLUSION: The model simulations revealed significant portal-to-central differences in almost all metabolic pathways involving carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids and detoxification.",0

2290,18329182,Psychological coping styles and cortisol over the day in healthy older adults,"Patterns of psychological coping are associated with a variety of health outcomes but the underlying pathways are not yet established. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between salivary cortisol output over the course of a day and coping style. Data were available from 350 men and 192 women with an average age of 60.9 years. Participants were drawn from the Whitehall II cohort, and had no history of cardiovascular disease. Individuals who were taking medication that might affect cortisol levels were also excluded. Saliva samples were provided on waking, then 0.5, 2.5, 8 and 12h after waking, and just before the participant went to sleep. Coping style was measured with a standard instrument, the COPE, and data were factor analysed to generate three factors: seeking social support, problem engagement and problem avoidance. The relationships between these factors and the cortisol awakening response (CAR), the slope of cortisol change over the day and total cortisol output over the day (excluding the waking period) were assessed using multiple linear regression. Cortisol output over the day was inversely associated with coping with stress by seeking social support (p=0.034) and by problem engagement (p=0.003), independently of age, gender, body mass index, smoking, depression, self-rated health, time of waking and income. Individuals who coped by problem engagement and seeking support had lower cortisol levels. Additionally, gender, BMI, smoking, self-rated health and time of waking were independently related to cortisol output over the day. There were no significant associations between coping and the CAR or cortisol slope over the day. The results indicate that adaptive coping styles are related to low levels of cortisol over the day, suggesting that neuroendocrine pathways may partly mediate relationships between psychological coping and health.

2291,14752829,AQP4 transfected into mouse cholangiocytes promotes water transport in biliary epithelia,"Rodent cholangiocytes express 6 of the 11 known channel proteins called aquaporins (AQPs) that are involved in transcellular water transport in mammals. However, clarifying the role of AQPs in mediating water transport in biliary epithelia has been limited in part because of the absence of physiologically relevant experimental models. In this study, we established a novel AQP4-transfected polarized mouse cholangiocyte cell line suitable for functional studies of transepithelial water transport, and, using this model, we define the importance of this AQP in water transport across biliary epithelia. Polarized normal mouse cholangiocytes (NMCs) lacking endogenous AQP4 were transfected stably with functional AQP4 or cotransfected with functional AQP4 and a transport-deficient AQP4 dominant negative mutant using a retroviral delivery system. In transfected NMCs, AQP4 is expressed on both the mRNA and protein levels and is localized at both the apical and basolateral membranes. In nontransfected NMCs, the transcellular water flow, P(f), value was relatively high (i.e., 16.4 +/- 3.2 microm/sec) and likely was a reflection of endogenous expression of AQP1 and AQP8. In NMCs transfected with AQP4, P(f) increased to 75.7 +/- 1.4 microm/sec, that is, by 4.6-fold, indicating the contribution of AQP4 in channel-mediated water transport across MNCs monolayer. In cotransfected NMCs, AQP4 dominant negative reduced P(f) twofold; no changes in P(f) were observed in NMCs transfected with the empty vector. In conclusion, we developed a novel polarized mouse cholangiocyte monolayer model, allowing direct study of AQP4-mediated water transport by biliary epithelia and generated data providing additional support for the importance of AQP4 in cholangiocyte water transport.",0
2292,18944498,Suppression of Phytophthora cinnamomi in Potting Mixes Amended with Uncomposted and Composted Animal Manures,"ABSTRACT We examined the effects of fresh and composted animal manures on the development of root rot, dieback, and plant death caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Fresh chicken manure, or chicken manure composted for 5 weeks before incorporation into the potting mix (25%, vol/vol), significantly reduced pathogen survival and the development of symptoms on Lupinus albus seedlings. Chicken manure composted for 2 weeks was less suppressive. Cow, sheep, and horse manure, whether fresh or composted, did not consistently suppress populations of P. cinnamomi or disease symptoms at the rates used (25%, vol/vol). All composts increased organic matter content, total biological activity, and populations of actinomycetes, fluorescent pseudomonads, and fungi. Only chicken manure stimulated endospore-forming bacteria, a factor that was strongly associated with seedling survival. Fallowing the potting mix for an additional 8 weeks after the first harvest increased the survival of lupin seedlings in a second bioassay, with survival rates in chicken manure compost-amended potting mix exceeding 90%. These data suggest that the ability of composted manure to stimulate sustained biological activity, in particular the activity of endospore-forming bacteria, is the key factor in reducing disease symptoms caused by P. cinnamomi. Supporting these results, the survival of rooted cuttings of Thryptomene calycina was significantly higher in sand-peat potting mix following amendment with commercially available chicken manure (15% vol/vol). However, this protection was reduced if the potting mix was steam pasteurized before amendment, indicating that suppression was due to endogenous as well as introduced microbes. Chicken manure compost incorporated at 5% (vol/vol) or more was strongly phytotoxic to young Banksia spinulosa plants and is not suitable as an amendment for phosphorus-sensitive plants. ",0
2293,8778601,Comparison of regularly scheduled with as-needed use of albuterol in mild asthma. Asthma Clinical Research Network,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled beta-agonists are the most commonly used treatment for asthma, but data suggest that regularly scheduled use of these agents may have deleterious effect on the control of asthma. We compared the effects of regularly scheduled use of inhaled albuterol with those of albuterol used only as needed in patients with mild chronic, stable asthma. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind study, we randomly assigned 255 patients with mild asthma to inhale albuterol either on a regular schedule (126 patients) or only as needed (129 patients). The patients were followed for 16 weeks. RESULTS: The primary outcome indicator, peak expiratory air flow measured in the morning, did not change significantly during the treatment period in the scheduled (416 liters per minute after the run-in period and 414 liters per minute after the treatment period) or the as-needed (424 liters per minute at both times) treatment groups (P=0.71). There were no significant differences between the two groups in peak flow variability, forced expiratory volume in one second, the number of puffs of supplemental albuterol needed, asthma symptoms, asthma quality-of-life score, or airway responsiveness to methacholine. The statistically significant differences between the groups in evening peak flow and in the short-term bronchodilator response to inhaled albuterol were small and judged to be clinically unimportant. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild asthma, neither deleterious nor beneficial effects derived from the regular use of inhaled albuterol beyond those derived from use of the drug as needed. Inhaled albuterol should be prescribed for patients with mild asthma on an as-needed basis.",0
2294,17661416,Is waiting time a measure of access to liver transplantation? Is shorter necessarily better?,"BACKGROUND: The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been used since February 2002 to allocate livers for transplantation from deceased donors according to medical need. Allocation based on MELD scores should ensure that sicker patients receive transplants first regardless of transplantation center volume. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the MELD score at transplantation and waiting time of liver transplant recipients differs by transplantation center volume. DESIGN: Analysis of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database. Centers were classified according to the volume of transplantations performed in 2005: high (> or =100 transplantations), medium (50 to 99 transplantations), and low (<50 transplantations). SETTING: Transplantation centers in the United States. PATIENTS: 20,075 transplant recipients between 27 February 2002 and 30 April 2006. MEASUREMENTS: MELD scores and waiting times of liver transplant recipients. RESULTS: Transplant recipients at high-volume centers had lower MELD scores (35.1% with MELD scores < or =18 vs. 22.7% and 27.0% at medium- and low-volume centers, respectively; P < 0.001), and the median MELD score was 22 compared with 24 at both medium- and low-volume centers. Despite having lower MELD scores, recipients at high-volume centers also experienced shorter waiting times (median waiting time, 69 days vs. 98 days and 94 days at medium-and low-volume centers, respectively; P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The definition of transplantation center volume was subjective. The recent implementation of MELD precluded analysis of differences in long-term outcomes related to waiting time or center volume. CONCLUSIONS: The MELD scores and waiting time of liver transplant recipients differed by transplantation center volume. High-volume centers have shorter waiting times and perform more transplantations for less sick patients. The reasons for these differences are unclear but warrant further investigation.",0

2296,12763939,Safety and effectiveness of long-term therapy with the oral iron chelator deferiprone,"The identification of a safe, orally active iron chelator is critically important for the prevention of morbidity and early death in patients receiving regular red cell transfusions. Based on our findings in a 1-year multicenter, prospective study of the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in patients with thalassemia major, we have extended the treatment period to 4 years. The mean dose of the chelator was 73 mg/kg per day during 531 patient-years. The rates of agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 500 x 10(9)/L) and milder forms of neutropenia (ANC, 500-1500 x 10(9)/L) were 0.2 and 2.8 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Neutropenia occurred significantly more commonly in patients with intact spleens. Gastrointestinal and joint symptoms decreased significantly after the first year of therapy, and led to discontinuation of deferiprone in only one patient in years 2 to 4. The mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value of 71 U/L after 4 years of therapy was significantly higher than the baseline value of 61 U/L. Trend analysis showed no increase in the ALT levels or the percentage of patients with ALT levels greater than twice the upper limit of the reference range. Ferritin levels did not change significantly from the values at the time of change from deferoxamine to deferiprone in either the intention-to-treat analysis or in the 84 patients who completed 4 years of therapy. Because of concerns regarding the effectiveness of the studied dose of deferiprone, 47 patients discontinued therapy, whereas 15 patients interrupted therapy because of concerns regarding low iron levels. The results of this study help to define the safety and effectiveness of long-term therapy with deferiprone.",1

Parkinson's disease: a modest effect,"""(1) If patients with Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa develop end-of-dose motor fluctuations, the standard therapy is to add bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, to their ongoing treatment. (2) Evaluation data available in 1999 on entacapone, a catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, failed to show whether the balance of benefits versus harm was at least equivalent to that of bromocriptine. (3) Entacapone is now also available as a triple fixed-dose combination with levodopa + carbidopa. (4) Three double-blind trials have compared triple combinations of levodopa + carbidopa (or benserazide) + entacapone with levodopa + carbidopa (or benserazide) + placebo. Two of these trials showed an increase of about 1 hour in """"on"""" phases during the day, together with a small reduction in the daily dose of levodopa. These results are consistent with earlier studies. (5) Entacapone has still not been compared with a dopamine agonist. (6) The fixed-dose combination of levodopa + carbidopa + entacapone has been compared with unfixed combinations in two unblinded trials only. (7) These two trials showed that efficacy was similar whether entacapone was used separately or included in a fixed-dose combination with levodopa + carbidopa. The only relevant trial (a non randomised cross-over trial) failed to show patient preference for the fixed-dose combination. (8) In France, a short-acting combination of levodopa and carbidopa is available, with a dose ratio of 10:1. This compares to a ratio of 4:1 for levodopa and carbidopa in the fixed-dose combination of levodopa + carbidopa + entacapone. The dose of carbidopa is therefore higher for a given dose of levodopa, provoking more dyskinesias and nausea. (9) Entacapone can cause drowsiness. Cases of cholestatic hepatitis have also been reported. Risks of liver toxicity, rhabdomyolysis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome remain to be determined. (10) In practice, bromocriptine remains the first-choice for adjunctive therapy when levodopa becomes ineffective.""",1

2300,17760894,Side effects of HIV therapy,"The use of highly active effective antiretroviral therapies (ART) has dramatically decreased the morbidity and mortality of the HIV infection. Over 20 anti-retroviral substances are available in four different classes. Side effects of HIV therapy are common and may influence the prognosis, as the medications are required lifelong for the still incurable infection. ART-associated allergic reactions, lipodystrophy syndrome and immune reconstitution syndrome are side effects frequently seen by dermatologists. Exanthems are challenging as drug reactions must be separated from immune reconstitution, syphilis and viral exanthems and then the causative agent must be identified from a long list of medications. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors typically cause allergic exanthems. Mitochondrial toxicity caused by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is responsible for lipoatrophy and fatty changes in the liver. Protease inhibitors cause diarrhea, abnormalities of glucose and fat metabolism and lipohypertrophy. Before other medications or surgical measures are undertaken to address side effects of ART, the regimen should be adjusted to include alternative but equally effective agents.",1

The aim of our report was to describe the first case of lethal hepatic failure in a female patient undergoing kidney transplantation (KTx) from a living donor after repeated sevoflurane anaesthesia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old hypertensive and diabetic female patient received kidney from her 70-year-old mother. There was an immediate graft function and around 800 ml of blood loss on the abdominal drains, which gradually decreased after the erythrocyte and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) substitution. On the first postoperative (p.o.) day she gradually became anuric and overweighed at the next day undergoing dialysis. Because of prolonged hypotension and somnolence she required reintubation. The second day transaminases increased (AST&ALT>700, LDH>1200 U/L). On the third p.o. day she was urgently reoperated because of a sudden excessive bleeding. However, there was a rather slow flow of tears from the whole operative field that was even more excessive after the operation with signs of a consumptive coagulopathy. She was adequately substituted until the bleeding stopped more than 24 hrs after its onset. The new laboratory results showed further increase in transaminazes (3300 U/L-ALT, 5100-AST, 8900-LDH) and ultrasound investigation confirmed an extensive toxic hepatic lesion. On the fourth p.o. night the patient was stable, diuresis rate was at 100 ml/hour, but in the morning she became hyposaturated because of an increased bronchial secretion. The dialysis could not improve the cardio-respiratory insufficiency and she died 30min later. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that sevoflurane can lead to a severe hepatotoxicity in at-risk individuals with repeated sevoflurane anaesthesia, having renal failure, in those with a preoperative known history of cardiovascular disorders, as well as in those with excessive extracellular volume. A particular precaution should be considered in cases of an elective surgery including organ transplantation.",1
2303,26536169,Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Papillary Renal-Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Papillary renal-cell carcinoma, which accounts for 15 to 20% of renal-cell carcinomas, is a heterogeneous disease that consists of various types of renal cancer, including tumors with indolent, multifocal presentation and solitary tumors with an aggressive, highly lethal phenotype. Little is known about the genetic basis of sporadic papillary renal-cell carcinoma, and no effective forms of therapy for advanced disease exist. METHODS: We performed comprehensive molecular characterization of 161 primary papillary renal-cell carcinomas, using whole-exome sequencing, copy-number analysis, messenger RNA and microRNA sequencing, DNA-methylation analysis, and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Type 1 and type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinomas were shown to be different types of renal cancer characterized by specific genetic alterations, with type 2 further classified into three individual subgroups on the basis of molecular differences associated with patient survival. Type 1 tumors were associated with MET alterations, whereas type 2 tumors were characterized by CDKN2A silencing, SETD2 mutations, TFE3 fusions, and increased expression of the NRF2-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. A CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was observed in a distinct subgroup of type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinomas that was characterized by poor survival and mutation of the gene encoding fumarate hydratase (FH). CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 and type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinomas were shown to be clinically and biologically distinct. Alterations in the MET pathway were associated with type 1, and activation of the NRF2-ARE pathway was associated with type 2; CDKN2A loss and CIMP in type 2 conveyed a poor prognosis. Furthermore, type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinoma consisted of at least three subtypes based on molecular and phenotypic features. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",0
2304,28445927,Vaccines targeting preS1 domain overcome immune tolerance in hepatitis B virus carrier mice,"Strong tolerance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigens limits the therapeutic effect of the conventional hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccination in both preclinical animal models and patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. In contrast, we observed that clinical CHB patients presented less immune tolerance to the preS1 domain of HBV large surface antigen. To study whether targeting the weak tolerance of the preS1 region could improve therapy gain, we explored vaccination with the long peptide of preS1 domain for HBV virions clearance. Our study showed that this preS1-polypeptide rather than HBsAg vaccination induced robust immune responses in HBV carrier mice. The anti-preS1 rapidly cleared HBV virions in vivo and blocked HBV infection to hepatocytes in vitro. Intriguingly, vaccination of preS1-polypeptide even reduced the tolerized status of HBsAg, opening a therapeutic window for the host to respond to the HBsAg vaccine. A sequential administration of antigenically distinct preS1-polypeptide and HBsAg vaccines in HBV carrier mice could finally induce HBsAg/hepatitis B surface antibody serological conversion and clear chronic HBV infection in carrier mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that preS1 can function as a therapeutic vaccine for the control of CHB. (Hepatology 2017;66:1067-1082).",0

2308,9024733,The efficacy and six-week tolerability of simvastatin 80 and 160 mg/day,"""The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin is the most effective of the currently approved hypolipidemic drugs and has been shown to reduce mortality and coronary morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease. For these patients the United States National Cholesterol Education Program advocates reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to <100 mg/dl. However, in some patients this cannot be achieved using monotherapy with simvastatin 40 mg/day, the current maximal recommended dose. To evaluate the effectiveness of extending the dosage range, 156 subjects with LDL cholesterol >160 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) <350 mg/dl were randomized to simvastatin at doses of 40, 80, and 160 mg/day in a 26 week, double-blind, 3-period, complete block crossover study. Each active treatment period was 6 weeks in duration with intervening 2 week washout periods. Median reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol were 41%, 47%, and 53% in the 40-, 80-, and 160-mg groups, respectively. The corresponding reductions in plasma TG were 21%, 23%, and 33%. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 6% to 8% in each group. One patient (0.7%) taking 160 mg developed myopathy; 1 patient (0.7%) taking 80 mg, and 3 (2.1%) taking 160 mg had transaminase elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal. No new or unexpected adverse effects were observed. We conclude that simvastatin at doses of 80 and 160 mg/day provides additional efficacy with a low short-term incidence of adverse effects; our results support the continued investigation of simvastatin at these doses.""",1

The effect of protease inhibitor (PI) therapy on liver fibrosis is unknown. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of PI therapy on HCV-related liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluated in a long-term follow-up retrospective cohort study the influence of antiretroviral therapy containing PI on liver fibrosis in 182 consecutive HIV/HCV coinfected patients. At liver biopsy, 63 patients had received PI and 119 patients had never been treated with PI. Relationships between liver histologic features, age, alcohol consumption, CD4 cell count, HIV-RNA load, and antiretroviral regimens were analyzed. Liver fibrosis stage was lower in patients receiving PIs by comparison with patients who had never received PIs (P =.03). The 5-, 15-, and 25-year cirrhosis rates were 2% versus 5%, 5% versus 18%, and 9% versus 27%, respectively, in patients who had received PIs compared with PI-untreated patients (P =.0006). Multivariate analysis identified 4 independent predictors of progression to cirrhosis: absence of protease inhibitor therapy (relative risk [RR] = 4.74, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-16.67), heavy alcohol consumption (> or = 50 g daily) (RR = 4.71, 95% CI, 1.92-11.57), low CD4 cell count (<200/microL) (RR = 2.74, 95% CI, 1.17-6.41), and age at HCV contamination (> or = 20 years) (RR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.04-5.38). In conclusion, protease inhibitor therapy might not accelerate progression to HCV-related cirrhosis. Furthermore, chronic use of antiretroviral therapy containing PI together with reduction of alcohol consumption and maintenance of high CD4 count could have a beneficial impact on liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.",1

2312,19570573,"Effect of interferon gamma-1b on survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (INSPIRE): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal disease for which no effective treatment exists. We assessed whether treatment with interferon gamma-1b improved survival compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and mild-to-moderate impairment of pulmonary function. METHODS: 826 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were enrolled from 81 centres in seven European countries, the USA, and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned (double-blind) in a 2:1 ratio to receive 200 microg interferon gamma-1b (n=551) or equivalent placebo (n=275) subcutaneously, three times per week. Eligible patients were aged 40-79 years, had been diagnosed in the past 48 months, had a forced vital capacity of 55-90% of the predicted value, and a haemoglobin-corrected carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of 35-90% of the predicted value. The primary endpoint was overall survival time from randomisation measured at the second interim analysis, when the proportion of deaths had reached 75% of those expected by the study conclusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00075998. FINDINGS: At the second interim analysis, the hazard ratio for mortality in patients on interferon gamma-1b showed absence of minimum benefit compared with placebo (1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.71, p=0.497), and indicated that the study should be stopped. After a median duration of 64 weeks (IQR 41-84) on treatment, 80 (15%) patients on interferon gamma-1b and 35 (13%) on placebo had died. Almost all patients reported at least one adverse event, and more patients on interferon gamma-1b group had constitutional signs and symptoms (influenza-like illness, fatigue, fever, and chills) than did those on placebo. Occurrence of serious adverse events (eg, pneumonia, respiratory failure) was similar for both treatment groups. Treatment adherence was good and few patients discontinued treatment prematurely in either group. INTERPRETATION: We cannot recommend treatment with interferon gamma-1b since the drug did not improve survival for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which refutes previous findings from subgroup analyses of survival in studies of patients with mild-to-moderate physiological impairment of pulmonary function.

2313,19306059,Differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions by mechanical imaging,"Mechanical imaging yields tissue elasticity map and provides quantitative characterization of a detected pathology. The changes in the surface stress patterns as a function of applied load provide information about the elastic composition and geometry of the underlying tissue structures. The objective of this study is the clinical evaluation of breast mechanical imager for breast lesion characterization and differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. The breast mechanical imager includes a probe with pressure sensor array, an electronic unit providing data acquisition from the pressure sensors and communication with a touch-screen laptop computer. We have developed an examination procedure and algorithms to provide assessment of breast lesion features such as hardness related parameters, mobility, and shape. A statistical Bayesian classifier was constructed to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions by utilizing all the listed features as the input. Clinical results for 179 cases, collected at four different clinical sites, have demonstrated that the breast mechanical imager provides a reliable image formation of breast tissue abnormalities and calculation of lesion features. Malignant breast lesions (histologically confirmed) demonstrated increased hardness and strain hardening as well as decreased mobility and longer boundary length in comparison with benign lesions. Statistical analysis of differentiation capability for 147 benign and 32 malignant lesions revealed an average sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 86.8% with a standard deviation of +/-6.1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve characterizing benign and malignant lesion discrimination is 86.1% with the confidence interval ranging from 80.3 to 90.9%, with a significance level of P = 0.0001 (area = 50%). The multisite clinical study demonstrated the capability of mechanical imaging for characterization and differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions. We hypothesize that the breast mechanical imager has the potential to be used as a cost effective device for cancer diagnostics that could reduce the benign biopsy rate, serve as an adjunct to mammography and to be utilized as a screening device for breast cancer detection.

To analyze the prevalence of anti-LC1 in childhood liver disease, we have tested the sera of 95 patients using immunoblot, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunodiffusion. Fifteen children had smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and/or anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)-positive AIH, 13 had anti-LKM-1-positive AIH, 14 had autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) (all SMA and/or ANA positive), and 53 had non-autoimmune liver disease (10 had alpha 1-anti-trypsin deficiency [alpha 1-ATD], 11 had Wilson's disease [WD], 14 had Alagille's syndrome, and 18 had chronic hepatitis B virus [HBV] infection). Twenty healthy children were studied as controls. Anti-LC1 positivity in immunodiffusion and strong reactivity in immunoblot were found in 4 LKM-1- and 2 SMA/ANA-positive patients with AIH and in 1 patient with ASC, but in none of the patients with other liver diseases nor in controls. A weak 60-kd band was detected by immunoblot in 6 more patients with AIH (2 were LKM-1- and 4 were SMA/ANA-positive) and 6 patients with ASC, all anti-LC1-negative by immunofluorescence and immunodiffusion. No distinct clinical features characterized the anti-LC1-positive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
2316,7549833,"A phase I-II study of high-dose thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen for autologous transplantation for malignant lymphoma","Thirty-four adults with malignant lymphoma at high-risk for relapse were treated on a Phase I-II study of high-dose thiotepa (THIO), busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) with autologous marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support. Four patients were in untreated relapse, 7 had stable or progressive disease, 12 were in partial remission, and 11 were in complete remission after reinduction chemotherapy before proceeding to the preparative regimen. Median follow-up time is 22 months. Grades 3-4 regimen-related toxicity occurred in 3 (14%) of 22 patients treated with THIO 250 mg/m2 x 3, BU 1 mg/kg x 10 and CYC 50 mg/kg x 3, and this was considered the maximal tolerated dose-schedule. Of the 23 patients with active disease at the time of transplantation, 52% (95% CI 31-73%) achieved a complete response, and 26% (95% CI 10-48%) achieved a partial response. For all patients, median time to progression was 13 months, median survival was 16 months, and disease-free survival at 18 months was 34% (95% CI 18-51%). The combination of THIO, BU and CYC is tolerable as a preparative regimen for lymphoma and has a high response rate, but further measures are needed to reduce the relapse rate for patients with advanced disease.",1
2317,25417615,"""The validity and reliability of """"The liver disease symptom index 2.0"""" for Turkish society""","Chronic liver diseases have been shown to adversely affect the quality of life. Standardized tools for patient assessment are of great importance for treatment and follow-up of these patients. In this study, we aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the Liver Symptom Index 2.0 (LDSI 2.0) for Turkish society, for use in other studies and in daily clinical practice. A total of 308 patients with chronic liver disease attending to the outpatient liver clinic of the Department of Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylül University between September 2011 and May 2012 were included in this study. A sociodemographic data questionnaire, the LDSI 2.0 comprising 24 items, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) were completed by the participating patients. After 6 weeks, these tools were re-administered to a total of 115 patients. After obtaining the required permissions, LDSI 2.0 was translated into Turkish using the translation/re-translation method. Of the 308 participants, 160 (51.9%) were male and 184 (43.1%) were female, with an average age of 48.67±13.31 years. Of all cases, 70.5% had viral hepatitis. The average Child-Pugh score was 5.9±1.2, and the average Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 10.2±3.2. The assessment tool comprised the following sub-items: itching, joint pain, abdominal pain, sleepiness, worry, appetite, depression, fear, jaundice, memory, personality, financial status, use of time, sexual desire, and sexual activity. For more than 50% of the patients, worry (68.8%), depression (65.3%), joint pain (62.3%), itch (56.5%), sleepiness (54.2%), memory problems (53.6), and sexual problems (50%) were present. The internal coefficient of consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficient) was 0.908, which indicates a very high level of consistency. The correlation coefficient for the intraobserver test/re-test reliability was 0.746 (p<0.000), which denotes a significant and good level of reliability. The construct validity between each sub-item of the tool and sub-items of SF-36 was assessed using Spearman's correlation test, which showed a weak to moderate correlation (<0.04 and 0.4-0.7) in the reverse direction. Our study findings provide supportive evidence of the reliability of the assessment tool. Its validity is similar to the original construct validity and was confirmed in our sample. Therefore, it was concluded that LDSI 2.0 was an appropriate tool for daily clinical use and research purposes. Simultaneous use of this life-quality assessment tool and SF-36 will enable a comprehensive but practical assessment of our patients. ",0
2318,11640997,Diabetic ketoacidosis in a case of pheochromocytoma,"A 31-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Ultrasound sonography revealed the existence of the left adrenal tumor and endocrinological examinations established a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. She had been healthy and there was no evidence for gestational diabetes in her personal history. Characteristic features were not found in her tumor size and the catecholamine levels as compared with typical cases of pheochromocytoma. An overwhelming secretion of catecholamine might suppress insulin secretion, as evidenced by the improvement after the resection of the tumor. However, a significant insulin resistance continued after tumor resection. Obesity and the heterozygosity of beta3-adrenergic receptor gene (Try64Arg) might play a role in insulin resistance, which resulted in DKA at least in part. Literature survey revealed four cases of DKA in the patients with pheochromocytoma including ours, three of which were Japanese. Pancreatic capacity to secrete insulin has been reported to be less than Caucasians, which might be another reason for DKA. Thus, we speculate that both suppressed insulin secretion and insulin resistance deteriorated by obesity or other factor(s) such as abnormality in beta3 adrenergic receptor probably depress beta-cell function resulting in abnormal metabolic imbalance such as DKA.

2319,24980778,Induced CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells in rheumatoid arthritis are modulated by p38 phosphorylation and monocytes expressing membrane tumor necrosis factor α and CD86,"Limiting the severity of inflammation and promoting its eventual resolution are vital for protecting host tissues both in autoimmunity and chronic infection. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of repurposing anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by analyzing its ability to induce CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Anti-CD3 mAb was cultured with RA PBMCs to induce CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells, which were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their phenotype. Treg cell induction was investigated via neutralization or blocking antibodies, cellular depletion, or ImageStream technology. Blotting was used to determine the signaling pathways involved in CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cell induction. Suppression of CD4+ T cell effector responses was assessed by Treg cell suppression assays and Mosaic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potent CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells were induced from RA PBMCs by anti-CD3 mAb. Unlike their CD4+ counterparts, CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells inhibited Th17 responses in a contact-dependent manner, thereby functioning to limit a wider range of inflammatory pathways. CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cell induction was supported both by p38 phosphorylation intrinsic to naive CD8+ T cells and by monocytes via CD86 and membrane tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Artificially increasing monocyte membrane TNFα or inhibiting CD8+ T cell p38 phosphorylation drove FoxP3 expression in a subset of initially unresponsive CD8+ T cells. These data define an unknown mechanism of CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cell induction by anti-CD3 mAb, which could be combined with a p38 inhibitor to improve therapeutic efficacy in RA patients and resolve chronic inflammation via the restoration of tolerance.

2320,15382127,Peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin-1 and -2 contribute to antimicrobial defense of the intrahepatic biliary tree,"Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are important antimicrobial peptides that contribute to innate immunity at mucosal surfaces. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of hBD-1 and hBD-2 in intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells in specimens of human liver, and 4 cultured cell lines (2 consisting of biliary epithelial cells and 2 cholangiocarcinoma cells). In addition, hBD-1 and hBD-2 were assayed in specimens of bile. hBD-1 was nonspecifically expressed immunohistochemically in intrahepatic biliary epithelium and hepatocytes in all patients studied, but expression of hBD-2 was restricted to large intrahepatic bile ducts in 8 of 10 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO), 7 of 11 with hepatolithiasis, 1 of 6 with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 1 of 5 with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 0 of 6 with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C), and 0 of 11 with normal hepatic histology. hBD-2 expression was evident in bile ducts exhibiting active inflammation. Serum C reactive protein levels correlated with biliary epithelial expression of hBD-2. Real-time PCR revealed that in all of 28 specimens of fresh liver, including specimens from patients with hepatolithiasis, PBC, PSC, CH-C and normal hepatic histology, hBD-1 messenger RNA was consistently expressed, whereas hBD-2 messenger RNA was selectively expressed in biliary epithelium of patients with hepatolithiasis. Immunobloting analysis revealed hBD-2 protein in bile in 1 of 3 patients with PSC, 1 of 3 with PBC, and each of 6 with hepatolithiasis; in contrast, hBD-1 was detectable in all bile samples examined. Four cultured biliary epithelial cell lines consistently expressed hBD-1; in contrast these cell lines did not express hBD-2 spontaneously but were induced to express hBD-2 by treatment with Eschericia coli, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In conclusion, these findings suggest that in the intrahepatic biliary tree, hBD-2 is expressed in response to local infection and/or active inflammation, whereas hBD-1 may constitute a preexisting component of the biliary antimicrobial defense system.",0
2321,3347339,Autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis reportedly coexists with disorders of autoimmune origin. The prevalence with which such disorders occur in the MS population has not been adequately investigated. We reviewed the medical records of 828 patients with definite MS and found that 4.8% had a past or present associated disorder in which autoimmune mechanisms presumably play a role. The cumulative prevalence of these disorders was no higher than that estimated for the general population. Serum from 105 patients, without clinical evidence of an associated autoimmune disorder, was tested for the presence of antinuclear, thyroid, parietal cell, smooth muscle, and mitochondrial antibodies. A significantly higher prevalence (p less than 0.01) of generally low titers of one or more autoantibodies was found in serum from the MS group, compared with a control group of 105 patients with other neurologic disorders. The increased frequency of serum autoantibodies probably reflects the existence of a nonspecific B cell overactivity in MS.",1
2322,18347132,Turning the gene tap off; implications of regulating gene expression for cancer therapeutics,"Cancer poses a tremendous therapeutic challenge worldwide, highlighting the critical need for developing novel therapeutics. A promising cancer treatment modality is gene therapy, which is a form of molecular medicine designed to introduce into target cells genetic material with therapeutic intent. Anticancer gene therapy strategies currently used in preclinical models, and in some cases in the clinic, include proapoptotic genes, oncolytic/replicative vectors, conditional cytotoxic approaches, inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of growth factor signaling, inactivation of oncogenes, inhibition of tumor invasion and stimulation of the immune system. The translation of these novel therapeutic modalities from the preclinical setting to the clinic has been driven by encouraging preclinical efficacy data and advances in gene delivery technologies. One area of intense research involves the ability to accurately regulate the levels of therapeutic gene expression to achieve enhanced efficacy and provide the capability to switch gene expression off completely if adverse side effects should arise. This feature could also be implemented to switch gene expression off when a successful therapeutic outcome ensues. Here, we will review recent developments related to the engineering of transcriptional switches within gene delivery systems, which could be implemented in clinical gene therapy applications directed at the treatment of cancer.

2323,3070713,[Hepatitis secondary to current non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents],"The authors report 83 cases of acute hepatitis secondary to non steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), published in the literature. The NSAID in question are: niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, pirprofen and sulindac. Six deaths are directly ascribed to NSAID: although rare, these forms of hepatitis deserve therefore to be reported. They are usually mixed immuno-allergic forms of hepatitis (cytolytic as well as cholestatic). They often affect elderly women taking multiple medications. Monitoring of the liver function tests is necessary, during prolonged treatment with NSAID, especially during the first six months.",1
2324,6087460,Hepatic tumors induced by sex steroids,"Our study of more than 250 women with hepatic tumors, accessioned in our tumor registry at the University of Louisville, disclosed three types of tumor: FNH , HCA, and HCC. The ingestion of sundry kinds of sex steroids by the majority of these women, chiefly for purposes of preventing conception, warrants the suspicion that such hormones induced these different types of hepatic tumors. Publications by others reporting similar hepatic tumors in men using male sex steroids lends support to this hypothesis. Rupture of the hepatic tumor and consequent hemorrhage, producing hemoperitoneum, is a major risk factor. Other presenting symptoms are pain and palpable mass. Symptomatic women using OCs should be subjected to a CT or technetium hepatic scan as an initial screening assessment. Because of the imminent possibility of rupture, large turgid vascular tumors should be resected without biopsy. Biopsy-proved HCC should also be removed surgically. All other tumors, including small multiple tumors, will usually regress when exogenous sex steroids are withdrawn and pregnancy avoided. Other significant hepatic changes observed in this study are peliosis hepatis, periportal sinusoidal dilation, and vascular lesions. The branches of the hepatic artery and the tributaries of the portal vein show combinations of intimal and smooth muscle proliferation, vascular thickening, occlusive intimal thickening, and, at times, obstructing thrombosis. Similar smooth muscle proliferation in the afferent vessels of the livers of animals treated with sex steroids suggests that there is a cause and effect relationship in women using OCs.",1

2326,15349911,Hepatitis C virus NS5A-regulated gene expression and signaling revealed via microarray and comparative promoter analyses,"Most individuals exposed to hepatitis C virus (HCV) become chronically infected and are predisposed to liver disease. The mechanisms underlying viral persistence and disease progression are unknown. A role for the HCV NS5A protein in viral replication and interferon resistance has been demonstrated. To identify mechanisms affected by NS5A, we analyzed the gene expression of Huh7 cells expressing NS5A and control cells using oligonucleotide microarrays. A set of 103 genes (43 up-regulated, 60 down-regulated) whose expression was modified by at least twofold was selected. These included genes involved in cell adhesion and motility, calcium homeostasis, lipid transport and metabolism, and genes regulating immune responses. The finding of modulated expression of genes related to the TGF-beta superfamily and liver fibrosis was observed. Interestingly, both the tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin beta receptors were down-regulated by NS5A. Similar data were obtained following expression of four NS5A mutants obtained from patients who were not responsive or were sensitive to interferon therapy. Through computational analysis, we determined that 39 of the 43 genes up-regulated by NS5A contained one or more nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding sites within their promoter region. Using the Gibbs sampling method, we also detected enrichment of NF-kappaB consensus binding sites in the upstream regions of the 43 coexpressed genes. Activation of NF-kappaB by NS5A was subsequently demonstrated in luciferase reporter assays. Adenovirus-mediated expression of IkappaBalpha reverted NS5A mediated up-regulation of gene expression. In conclusion, this study suggests a role of NS5A and NF-kappaB in HCV pathogenesis and related liver disease.

Because this agent is currently being administered experimentally to human beings, we studied its effect on coagulation and platelet function in man. In five subjects, a four-hour infusion of somatostatin (500 micrograms per hour) had no definite effect on platelet count, leukocyte count, hematocrit, platelet adhesiveness and aggregation, bleeding time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen levels. A similar infusion for 18 hours in three subjects was likewise without effect. These studies indicate that somatostatin does not affect coagulation and platelet function in man and that its prolonged administration lacks ostensible toxicity.",0

Literature was identified, selected and appraised in accordance with the methods of a systematic review. Articles potentially relevant to the research question were identified by searching the following electronic databases: Amed, Cinahl, Index to UK theses, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Sports discus and Web of science. Duplicates were removed and, based on the title and abstract, the full text of relevant studies were retrieved. Two reviewers independently assessed papers; this formed the basis for the inclusion of the most appropriate trials. From the 479 articles originally identified, nine were deemed appropriate for inclusion in the review. In general, specific data relating to this relationship was limited. Outcomes of the nine investigations were difficult to compare due to differing methods used across studies. Results have proved conflicting, with limited evidence found to implicate any specific foot type as a potential risk factor for tibial stress injuries. No definitive conclusions can be drawn relating foot structure or function to an increased risk of tibial stress injuries. Extremes of foot types are likely to pose an increased risk of tibial stress injuries compared to normal arched feet. ",0
2329,29130810,Outcomes after Angiography with Sodium Bicarbonate and Acetylcysteine,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous sodium bicarbonate and oral acetylcysteine are widely used to prevent acute kidney injury and associated adverse outcomes after angiography without definitive evidence of their efficacy. METHODS: Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 5177 patients at high risk for renal complications who were scheduled for angiography to receive intravenous 1.26% sodium bicarbonate or intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride and 5 days of oral acetylcysteine or oral placebo; of these patients, 4993 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary end point was a composite of death, the need for dialysis, or a persistent increase of at least 50% from baseline in the serum creatinine level at 90 days. Contrast-associated acute kidney injury was a secondary end point. RESULTS: The sponsor stopped the trial after a prespecified interim analysis. There was no interaction between sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine with respect to the primary end point (P=0.33). The primary end point occurred in 110 of 2511 patients (4.4%) in the sodium bicarbonate group as compared with 116 of 2482 (4.7%) in the sodium chloride group (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.22; P=0.62) and in 114 of 2495 patients (4.6%) in the acetylcysteine group as compared with 112 of 2498 (4.5%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.33; P=0.88). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of contrast-associated acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high risk for renal complications who were undergoing angiography, there was no benefit of intravenous sodium bicarbonate over intravenous sodium chloride or of oral acetylcysteine over placebo for the prevention of death, need for dialysis, or persistent decline in kidney function at 90 days or for the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury.

2330,24311635,The mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor AZD2014 enhances the radiosensitivity of glioblastoma stem-like cells,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been suggested as a target for radiosensitization. Given that radiotherapy is a primary treatment modality for glioblastoma (GBM) and that mTOR is often dysregulated in GBM, the goal of this study was to determine the effects of AZD2014, a dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor, on the radiosensitivity of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs). mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities were defined by immunoblot analysis. The effects of this mTOR inhibitor on the in vitro radiosensitivity of GSCs were determined using a clonogenic assay. DNA double strand breaks were evaluated according to γH2AX foci. Orthotopic xenografts initiated from GSCs were used to define the in vivo response to AZD2014 and radiation. Exposure of GSCs to AZD2014 resulted in the inhibition of mTORC1 and 2 activities. Based on clonogenic survival analysis, addition of AZD2014 to culture media 1 hour before irradiation enhanced the radiosensitivity of CD133+ and CD15+ GSC cell lines. Whereas AZD2014 treatment had no effect on the initial level of γH2AX foci, the dispersal of radiation-induced γH2AX foci was significantly delayed. Finally, the combination of AZD2014 and radiation delivered to mice bearing GSC-initiated orthotopic xenografts significantly prolonged survival as compared with the individual treatments. These data indicate that AZD2014 enhances the radiosensitivity of GSCs both in vitro and under orthotopic in vivo conditions and suggest that this effect involves an inhibition of DNA repair. Moreover, these results suggest that this dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor may be a radiosensitizer applicable to GBM therapy. ",0

This loss in plasticity or flexibility leads to overdependence on the metabolism of an individual category of substrates, with the predominance in fatty acid metabolism characteristic of diabetic heart disease and the accelerated glucose use associated with pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy being prime examples. There is a strong demand for accurate noninvasive imaging approaches of myocardial substrate metabolism that can facilitate the crosstalk between the bench and the bedside, leading to improved patient management paradigms. In this article potential future applications of metabolic imaging, particularly radionuclide approaches, for assessment of cardiovascular disease are discussed. ",0
2332,10979796,Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men,"""BACKGROUND: Despite its association with disability, death, and increased medical costs, osteoporosis in men has been relatively neglected as a subject of study. There have been no large, controlled trials of treatment in men. METHODS: In a two-year double-blind trial, we studied the effect of 10 mg of alendronate or placebo, given daily, on bone mineral density in 241 men (age, 31 to 87 years; mean, 63) with osteoporosis. Approximately one third had low serum free testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density. RESULTS: The men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density. The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate group (P=0.02). Alendronate was generally well tolerated.

2334,10385557,Secretion of activin A in recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma,"Activin A is a dimeric protein, composed of two beta-A subunits, that belongs to the TGF-beta family of growth factors. Most primary epithelial ovarian tumors (96%) synthesize and secrete activin protein in vitro and preliminary studies show that serum levels of activin are frequently elevated in women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Our objectives were to expand on studies of serum activin A levels in women with epithelial ovarian cancer and to determine whether levels of activin A correlate with the clinical course of disease. Preoperative serum activin A levels were measured in 41 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. In addition, serum activin A levels were measured in all available postoperative samples from the subset of these patients (n = 26) who had an elevated preoperative serum activin A level. Medical record information was used to compare each patient's serum levels of activin A to the clinical course of disease. Seventy-two percent of the stage III and IV patients (26/36), and none (0/5) of the stage I patients, had an elevated preoperative serum activin level. In postoperative samples, activin A levels were increased with persistent or recurrent (n = 9) stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Activin A levels dropped postoperatively and remained at or below the control level in patients in remission. Serum activin A levels correlate with recurrent or persistent disease in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. ",0

The detection ratio of HCHs and DDTs' isomers ranged from 77.78% to 100.00%. Concentrations of HCHs and DDTs in surface soils ranged from 0.97 ng x g(-1) to 247.40 ng x g(-1) (mean 10.17 ng x g(-1)) and 0.01 ng x g(-1) to 384.75 ng x g(-1) (mean 18.91 ng x g(-1)), respectively. Compared with other regions, the pollution of OCPs in Jiufeng Mountain Range stayed at a low level. The residue level in different types of lands was in the order as: paddy field > vegetable land > tea land > woodland. Source analysis indicated that Lindane and dicofol might be used recently in this area. The incremental lifetime, cancer risks (ILCRs) of different age groups (children, youths, and adults) were all within the acceptable risk range of 10(-6) to 10(-4) recommended by USEPA for carcinogenic chemicals. The residue level of OCPs in soil may not cause cancer risk for local residents basically. ",0
2336,16517021,Brain regional alterations in the modulation of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in liver cirrhosis. Role of hyperammonemia and cell types involved,"Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome present in patients with liver disease that includes impaired intellectual function and alterations in personality and neuromuscular coordination. Hyperammonemia and liver failure result in altered glutamatergic neurotransmission, which contributes to hepatic encephalopathy. Alterations in the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway may be responsible for some of the neurological alterations found in hepatic encephalopathy. The function of this pathway is altered in brain from patients died with liver cirrhosis and one altered step of the pathway is the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide, which is increased in cerebral cortex and reduced in cerebellum from these patients. Portacaval anastomosis and bile duct ligation plus hyperammonemia in rats reproduce the alterations in the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO both in cerebellum and cerebral cortex. We assessed whether hyperammonemia is responsible for the region-selective alterations in guanylate cyclase modulation in liver cirrhosis and whether the alteration occurs in neurons or in astrocytes. Activation of guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide is lower in cerebellar neurons exposed to ammonia (1.5-fold) than in control neurons (3.3-fold). The activation of guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide is higher in cortical neurons exposed to ammonia (8.7-fold) than in control neurons (5.5-fold). The activation is not affected in cerebellar or cortical astrocytes. These findings indicate that hyperammonemia is responsible for the differential alterations in the modulation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide in cerebellum and cerebral cortex of cirrhotic patients. Moreover, under the conditions used, the alterations occur selectively in neurons and not in astrocytes. ",0
2337,10383699,Origin of hyperplastic epithelial cells in idiopathic collapsing glomerulopathy,"Glomerular epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia are listed as the primary criteria for the diagnosis of collapsing glomerulopathy (CG), a distinct variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, the extent of podocyte phenotypic alterations that occur in CG, and the origin of the hyperplastic epithelial cells remain to be established. Renal biopsy materials from seven out of three patients with CG were studied by serial section analysis for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Markers for podocytes (PHM5 and synaptopodin), parietal epithelial cells (PECs: cytokeratin) and macrophages (CD68) were used for the immunohistochemistry. Multiple ultrathin sections from a total of 15 glomeruli, including some from patients with CG, were examined by electron microscopy. Glomerular adhesions occurred in 71% of the serially sectioned glomeruli taken from patients with CG. Hyperplastic epithelial cells were immunonegative for podocyte markers and CD68, but invariably immunopositive for cytokeratin. Electron microscopy revealed that detachment of the podocytes from involved glomerular capillary walls was extensive. Many of the detached podocytes appeared to be necrotic and apoptotic. In contrast, junctional complexes of desmosomes and zonula adherens connected hyperplastic epithelial cells to each other. Cilia were also often observed. The results of our ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study suggest that the hyperplastic epithelial cells observed in cases of CG are derived from PECs. Our results raise the possibility that PECs play a general role in covering glomerular tufts from which the podocytes have disappeared. ",0

It was found that 5-hour exposure did not change physiological responses to test workloads, when compared to the baseline studies. In the simulation studies, changes in acid-base equilibrium of venous blood were more significant than those of mixed capillary blood. The variations of the parameters under study reflected primarily the effect of hyperoxia on metabolic processes. The head-down position affected the level of variations in gas composition and acid-base equilibrium of venous blood. These changes were transient and rapidly returned to the norm after termination of the exposure. ",0
2340,25563992,Hematopoietic stem cell infusion/transplantation for induction of allograft tolerance,"The present review updates the current status of basic, preclinical, and clinical research on donor hematopoietic stem cell infusion for allograft tolerance induction. Recent basic studies in mice provide evidence of significant involvement of both central deletional and peripheral regulatory mechanisms in induction and maintenance of allograft tolerance effected through a mixed chimerism approach with donor hematopoietic stem cell infusion. The presence of heterologous memory T cells in primates hampers the induction of persistent chimerism. Durable mixed chimerism, however, now has been recently induced in inbred major histocompatibility complex-mismatched swine, resulting in tolerance of vascularized composite tissue allografts. In clinical transplantation, allograft tolerance has been achieved in human leukocyte antigen-mismatched kidney transplantation after the induction of transient mixed chimerism or persistent full donor chimerism. Tolerance induction in clinical kidney transplantation has been achieved by donor hematopoietic stem cell infusion. Improving the consistency and safety of tolerance induction and extending successful protocols to other organs, and to organs from deceased donors, are critical next steps to bringing tolerance to a wider range of clinical applications.

2341,11484689,Clinical and molecular genetic features of pulmonary hypertension in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with familial primary pulmonary hypertension have defects in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPR2), a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of receptors. Because patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia may have lung disease that is indistinguishable from primary pulmonary hypertension, we investigated the genetic basis of lung disease in these patients. METHODS: We evaluated members of five kindreds plus one individual patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and identified 10 cases of pulmonary hypertension. In the two largest families, we used microsatellite markers to test for linkage to genes encoding TGF-beta-receptor proteins, including endoglin and activin-receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), and BMPR2. In subjects with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary hypertension, we also scanned ALK1 and BMPR2 for mutations. RESULTS: We identified suggestive linkage of pulmonary hypertension with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on chromosome 12q13, a region that includes ALK1. We identified amino acid changes in activin-receptor-like kinase 1 that were inherited in subjects who had a disorder with clinical and histologic features indistinguishable from those of primary pulmonary hypertension. Immunohistochemical analysis in four subjects and one control showed pulmonary vascular endothelial expression of activin-receptor-like kinase 1 in normal and diseased pulmonary arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can involve mutations in ALK1. These mutations are associated with diverse effects, including the vascular dilatation characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and the occlusion of small pulmonary arteries that is typical of primary pulmonary hypertension.",0
2342,8855174,"Long-term ganciclovir chemotherapy for congenital duck hepatitis B virus infection in vivo: effect on intrahepatic-viral DNA, RNA, and protein expression","Long-term antiviral chemotherapy using the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir was undertaken with the aim of eliminating hepadnaviral covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA from the livers of ducks that were congenitally infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Twenty-four weeks of ganciclovir therapy caused a substantial reduction in viremia, intrahepatic viral DNA replicative intermediates, and viral core proteins. Unfortunately, ganciclovir therapy did not substantially affect CCC DNA or viral RNA levels, and the treatment resulted in an increase in the intrahepatic expression of the viral envelope proteins, pre-S and S. By the completion of therapy, the viral envelope proteins had assembled into large aggregates within the cytoplasm of most hepatocytes. Viral replication in the bile duct epithelial cells and in the extrahepatic sites was likewise not affected by long-term ganciclovir therapy. In conclusion, 24 weeks of ganciclovir therapy decreased most viral replication markers within the liver, except for those of viral CCC DNA, RNA, and envelope proteins. Long-term therapeutic strategies using nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir should be used with caution in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The careful monitoring of serum and hepatic markers of viral replication may therefore be important to avoid possible toxic consequences, such as the selective accumulation of viral proteins.",0

Five hundred and thirty-two thalassaemia patients from 86 treatment centres were enrolled in this programme. One hundred and eighty-seven patients (32%) experienced a total of 269 events that led to a temporary interruption or, in some cases, to a discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of agranulocytosis and milder neutropenias were 0.4/100 and 2.1/100 patient-years respectively. Neutropenia occurred predominantly in younger and non-splenectomized patients. Transient alanine transaminase increase, gastrointestinal discomfort and arthralgia were the other most commonly reported events. Ferritin levels showed a significant decrease in time after 3 years of therapy. This is the largest number of deferiprone-treated patients to have been reported to date. These data show that the drug was effective in reducing serum ferritin levels and the incidence of adverse events was not greater than the frequency reported in clinical trials.",1

We also intend to use this antiserum to investigate normal, age-related changes in human articular cartilage. The antiserum was raised in rabbits and its localization in cryosections of normal articular cartilage was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The concentration of the aggrecanase neo-epitope was also investigated in extracts of the tissue using SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis in large pore/agarose gels. The product of aggrecanase action appears to accumulate in the extracellular matrix during normal aging of the tissue. Furthermore, the concentration of the fragment depended on the topographical site on the femoral condyle from which the sample was selected. Electrophoretic and immunohistochemical analysis of the fragment in normal cartilage showed that in immature cartilage it was deposited mainly in the surface layers, whereas in mature samples it was distributed throughout the depth of the tissue. In contrast, immunoreactivity of osteoarthritic cartilage was always less and the distribution was more variable than in normal cartilage of the same age. (1) The proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan by aggrecanase is a normal homeostatic event and much of the neo-C terminal fragment produced by the enzyme is retained in the tissue. (2) The presence of this immunoreactive product in normal cartilage can be used as an indication of aggrecan turnover. (3) That in osteoarthritic cartilage there is a reduction in the concentration of the G1-fragments. ",0
2346,15849435,Efficacy of colestimide coadministered with atorvastatin in japanese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH),"BACKGROUND: Colestimide, a 2-methylimidazole-epichlorohydrin polymer, is a new bile-acid-sequestering resin, that is 4-fold as powerful at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the conventional resin (cholestyramine). Moreover, colestimide has excellent patient compliance because it is available in tablet form. METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical efficacy of colestimide coadministered with atorvastatin on lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations was examined in 15 patients (M/F=10/5, mean+/-SE age=54+/-9 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). After a period of wash-out of any lipid-lowering drugs, atorvastatin (20-40 mg) was administered to patients for at least 8 weeks, and then 3 g of colestimide was administered for a further 8 weeks. Total and LDL-C significantly (<0.0001) decreased by 35% from 361 to 233 mg/dl and 41% from 274 to 161 mg/dl, respectively. Addition of colestimide caused a further significant 12% and 20% reduction, respectively, from the initial values to 205 and 129 mg/dl, respectively. Colestimide was also effective in reducing serum LDL-C concentrations in heterozygous FH patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides>or=150 mg/dl). CONCLUSIONS: When monotherapy with atorvastatin is insufficient to treat severely hypercholesterolemic patients, such as those with heterozygous FH, colestimide acts to reinforce the action of statins.",1
2347,8690406,Interferon gamma down-regulates cytochrome P450 3A genes in primary cultures of well-differentiated rat hepatocytes,"Administration of interferons of both the gamma and alfa/beta classes down-regulates hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes when administered to humans or rats. In male rats, interferons decrease expression of CYP3A2 at a pretranslational level, but because interferons also release other cytokines in vivo, it is unclear whether this is a direct effect on hepatocytes. We therefore examined the effects of rat recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on CYP3A2, other 3A genes, and 2C11 in stable primary cultures of male rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were cultured on matrigel in Williams' E, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for 3A2, 3A1-like CYPs, and 2C11 mRNA were determined by RNase protection assays. CYP3A and 2C11 proteins were immunoquantified, and their catalytic activities were estimated by testosterone hydroxylation pathways. In control cells, 3A2 mRNA decreased initially but then recovered, and stable levels (15% of freshly isolated cells) were attained between days 3 and 7. Phenobarbital increased 3A2 mRNA to 60-120% values of freshly isolated cells, and mRNA for 3A1-like CYPs were increased 20-fold. In both control and phenobarbital-treated hepatocytes, rat recombinant IFN-gamma (33 U/mL) reduced mRNA for 3A2 and 3A1-like CYPs, as well as 3A protein and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity. Interferon had no effect on CYP2C11 at mRNA or protein levels in untreated cells, although a reduction in 2C11 protein was evident in phenobarbital-treated cultures. It is concluded that interferon directly alters expression of constitutive and inducible CYP3A genes in well-differentiated male rat hepatocytes in culture, but has no effect on constitutive expression of CYP2C11.",0

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study (NCT00617461). SETTING: Thirty-five outpatient centers in Germany and the United States. SUBJECTS: Subjects aged ?18 years with a diagnosis of PHN. METHODS: During a 2-week baseline period, subjects received open-label treatment with 1,800?mg/day gabapentin. Subjects who had a mean 24-hour average pain intensity score ?4 during the last 7 days of the baseline period were randomized to receive GEn (1,200 or 3,600?mg/day) for treatment period 1 (28 days), followed by GEn 2,400?mg/day (4 days), and the alternate GEn dose for treatment period 2 (28 days). RESULTS: There was a modest but significant improvement in pain intensity scores with GEn 3,600?mg vs 1,200?mg (adjusted mean [90% confidence interval] treatment difference, -0.29 [-0.48 to -0.10]; P?=?0.013). The difference in efficacy between doses was observed primarily in subjects who received the higher dose during treatment period 2; certain aspects of the study design may have contributed to this outcome. Plasma steady-state gabapentin exposure during GEn treatment was as expected and consistent between treatment periods. No new safety signals or adverse event trends relating to GEn exposure were identified. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall results demonstrated efficacy in a PHN population, the differences between treatment periods confound the interpretation. These findings could provide insight into future trial designs.""",1

2351,20197595,[Hepatotoxicity associated with the use of Herbalife],"""OBJECTIVE: Many herbal products are known to be hepatotoxic. In a recent survey in Iceland concerning adverse reactions related to herbal medicines, Herbalife products were implicated in the majority of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity. METHODS: The clinical presentations of five cases of Herbalife related liver injury during the period of 1999-2008 are analysed. Causality was assessed by using the WHO-UMC system for causality assessment and the RUCAM method. RESULTS: Of the five cases there were four females and one male; median age was 46 years (range 29-78). Herbalife had been used for 1 to 7 months prior to presentation. Four patients presented with a hepatocellular and one with a cholestatic reaction. Median values were for bilirubin 190 micromol/L (range: 26-311; ref. < 20 micromol/L), ALP 407 U/L (range: 149-712; ref. 35-105 U/L) and ALT 24 87 U/L (range: 456-2637; ref. 70 and 45 U/L for males and females, respectively). Liver biopsy was performed in 2 patients and was consistent with toxic hepatitis in both cases. Other causes of hepatitis were excluded by appropriate serological testing and ultrasound. Causality assessment according to RUCAM was probable in three cases and possible in two. Using the WHO-UMC criteria causality was certain in one case, probable in two and possible in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatotoxicity is probably associated with the use of Herbalife products. Hepatotoxicity due to herbal remedies is an important differential diagnosis in the diagnostic work-up of liver injury.""",1

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed. After an 8-week baseline phase, patients were randomized to a 16-week double-blind treatment period (8-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extension study. Primary efficacy was the percentage change from baseline in monthly seizure frequency and compared across treatment arms. Secondary efficacy comparisons included the proportion of patients experiencing >/=50% reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate), emergence of new seizure types, and physician assessment of global clinical improvement. Safety/tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), physical and neurologic examinations, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population. RESULTS: Of the 399 randomized patients, 279 (69.9%) completed the double-blind treatment period. The median percent change in monthly total partial seizure frequency from baseline was -23% for 600 mg/day, -29% for 900 mg/day, and -35% for 1,200 mg/day vs -13% for placebo (p < 0.001 for overall difference across all treatment arms).

Five hundred and seventy-six patients with type 2 diabetes of at least 6 months' duration were randomized to receive monotherapy with repaglinide (n = 383) or glyburide (n = 193). During weeks 1-8, doses were gradually increased to achieve a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) range of 80-140 mg/dl. The final adjusted dose was maintained for 12 months. Repaglinide patients received a starting dose of 0.5 mg three times/day preprandially, adjusted as necessary to 1, 2 or 4 mg before breakfast, lunch and dinner. Glyburide patients received a starting dose of 2.5 mg before breakfast and placebo before lunch and dinner. Glyburide was increased as necessary to 5 or 10 mg before breakfast (placebo before lunch and dinner) or to 15 mg (10 mg before breakfast, placebo before lunch, and 5 mg before dinner). After study drug was stopped, patients were transferred to an appropriate therapy, as recommended by the investigator. Efficacy was assessed by changes from baseline in glycemic control parameters and in C-peptide, insulin, and lipid profiles. Repaglinide provided glycemic control that was at least as effective and potentially safer than that provided by glyburide. The glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide was most pronounced in pharmacotherapy-naive patients, who showed rapid and marked decreases in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels from baseline (9.4%) to month 3 (7.6%) and month 12 (7.9%). Mean FPG levels also decreased overall in this group, from 222 mg/dl at baseline, to 175 mg/dl at month 3, to 188 mg/dl at month 12. At endpoint, morning C-peptide levels had increased significantly in glyburide-treated patients compared with those treated with repaglinide, but morning fasting insulin levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. Repaglinide efficacy was sustained over 1 year and was not influenced by age or sex. Overall safety and changes in lipid profile and body weight were similar with both agents, with no significant change after extended pharmacotherapy. Weight gain data for the subset of pharmacotherapy-na?ve patients suggest that patients given repaglinide may gain less weight than those given glyburide. Repaglinide, at doses of 0.5-4.0 mg administered three times preprandially, was well tolerated and provided safe and consistently effectiveglycemic control during this 1-year study.

Emptying half-time in normals was 68 +/- 5 min with 16.9 +/- 2.9% remaining at 120 min. Nine of 11 patients gained weight, with a mean increase of 6.7 +/- 1.6 lb (range 2-12 lb). We conclude that cisapride significantly reduces gastrointestinal symptoms and promotes weight gain in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis and is associated with improvement in solid gastric emptying. The drug is useful in patients who previously failed metoclopramide.",1

2361,18562231,Cross-sectional multicenter study of patients with urea cycle disorders in the United States,"Inherited urea cycle disorders comprise eight disorders (UCD), each caused by a deficiency of one of the proteins that is essential for ureagenesis. We report on a cross-sectional investigation to determine clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with UCD in the United States. The data used for the analysis was collected at the time of enrollment of individuals with inherited UCD into a longitudinal observation study. The study has been conducted by the Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium within the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) funded by the National Institutes of Health. One-hundred eighty-three patients were enrolled into the study. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency was the most frequent disorder (55%), followed by argininosuccinic aciduria (16%) and citrullinemia (14%). Seventy-nine percent of the participants were white (16% Latinos), and 6% were African American. Intellectual and developmental disabilities were reported in 39% with learning disabilities (35%) and half had abnormal neurological examination. Sixty-three percent were on a protein restricted diet, 37% were on Na-phenylbutyrate and 5% were on Na-benzoate. Forty-five percent of OTC deficient patients were on L-citrulline, while most patients with citrullinemia (58%) and argininosuccinic aciduria (79%) were on L-arginine. Plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids were reduced in patients treated with ammonia scavenger drugs. Plasma glutamine levels were higher in proximal UCD and in neonatal type disease. The RDCRN allows comprehensive analyses of rare inherited UCD, their frequencies and current medical practices.",1

2363,22762315,Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C,"BACKGROUND: Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that are based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C is an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR. METHODS: Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1119 participants from 5 different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials. RESULTS: Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) with the combined equation, as compared with 3.7 and 3.4 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P=0.07 and P=0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2), respectively [P=0.001 and P<0.001]), and the results were more accurate (percentage of estimates that were >30% of measured GFR, 8.5 vs. 12.8 and 14.1, respectively [P<0.001 for both comparisons]). In participants whose estimated GFR based on creatinine was 45 to 74 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2), the combined equation improved the classification of measured GFR as either less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) or greater than or equal to 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) (net reclassification index, 19.4% [P<0.001]) and correctly reclassified 16.9% of those with an estimated GFR of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) as having a GFR of 60 ml or higher per minute per 1.73 m(2). CONCLUSIONS: The combined creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations based on either of these markers alone and may be useful as a confirmatory test for chronic kidney disease.

2364,28099951,Complex X-Chromosomal Rearrangements in Two Women with Ovarian Dysfunction: Implications of Chromothripsis/Chromoanasynthesis-Dependent and -Independent Origins of Complex Genomic Alterations,"Our current understanding of the phenotypic consequences and the molecular basis of germline complex chromosomal rearrangements remains fragmentary. Here, we report the clinical and molecular characteristics of 2 women with germline complex X-chromosomal rearrangements. Patient 1 presented with nonsyndromic ovarian dysfunction and hyperthyroidism; patient 2 exhibited various Turner syndrome- associated symptoms including ovarian dysfunction, short stature, and autoimmune hypothyroidism. The genomic abnormalities of the patients were characterized by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, high-resolution karyotyping, microsatellite genotyping, X-inactivation analysis, and bisulfite sequencing. Patient 1 carried a rearrangement of unknown parental origin with a 46,X,der(X)(pter→ p22.1::p11.23→q24::q21.3→q24::p11.4→pter) karyotype, indicative of a catastrophic chromosomal reconstruction due to chromothripsis/chromoanasynthesis. Patient 2 had a paternally derived isochromosome with a 46,X,der(X)(pter→ p22.31::q22.1→q10::q10→q22.1::p22.31→pter) karyotype, which likely resulted from 2 independent, sequential events. Both patients showed completely skewed X inactivation. CpG sites at Xp22.3 were hypermethylated in patient 2. The results indicate that germline complex X-chromosomal rearrangements underlie nonsyndromic ovarian dysfunction and Turner syndrome. Disease-causative mechanisms of these rearrangements likely include aberrant DNA methylation, in addition to X-chromosomal mispairing and haploinsufficiency of genes escaping X inactivation. Notably, our data imply that germline complex X-chromosomal rearrangements are created through both chromothripsis/chromoanasynthesis-dependent and -independent processes. ",0
2365,24429311,Correlation of plasma anti-tuberculosis drug levels with subsequent development of hepatotoxicity,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the free and total plasma drug concentrations of rifampicin (RMP), isoniazid and pyrazinamide in subjects with or without anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH). METHODS: A total of 110 tuberculosis (TB) patients were administered daily anti-tuberculosis treatment and were prospectively followed for the development of DIH. Plasma drug levels were measured at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h on days 1, 7 and 14 of treatment. Plasma drug levels in 15 patients who developed DIH (cases) were compared with 95 patients who did not (controls). RESULTS: Female sex, body mass index < 17 kg/m(2) and baseline serum albumin < 4 g/dl predicted risk of DIH on univariate analyses. Free and total plasma RMP levels (Cmax and AUC0-4) on days 1, 7 and 14 were significantly higher in cases compared to controls and predicted development of DIH. Day 7 total RMP Cmax and AUC0-4 were higher in cases (mean 26.73, standard deviation [SD] 5.72 and 47.58, SD 33.10) than in controls (7.87, SD 10.95 and 14.01, SD 10.69, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma RMP levels were higher in cases than in controls and independently predicted subsequent development of DIH. The Cmax of Day 7 total RMP level (cut-off 12.50 mg/l) predicted subsequent development of DIH in 93.3% of the patients.",1

DESIGN: Multicenter, 25-week, phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group. SETTING: Outpatient; visits every 4 weeks. PATIENTS: Aged 18 to 64 years; DSM-IV criteria for chronic primary insomnia; > or =3 months of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or experiencing nonrestorative sleep. INTERVENTIONS: Single-dose zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg (n = 669) or placebo (n = 349), self-administered from a minimum of 3 nights/week to a maximum of 7 nights/week. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patient's Global Impression (PGI) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) were assessed every 4 weeks up to week 24. Patient Morning Questionnaire (PMQ), recorded daily, assessed subjective sleep measures-sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), number of awakenings (NAW), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and quality of sleep (QOS)-and next-day functioning. At week 12, PGI, Item 1 (aid to sleep), the primary endpoint, was scored as favorable (i.e., """"helped me sleep"""") by 89.8% of zolpidem patients vs. 51.4% of placebo patients (P < 0.0001, based on rank score) and at week 24 by 92.3% of zolpidem extended-release patients vs. 59.7% of placebo patients. Zolpidem extended-release also was statistically significantly superior to placebo at every time point for PGI (Items 1-4) and CGI-I (P < 0.0001, rank score), TST, WASO, QOS (P < 0.0001), and SOL (P < or = 0.0014); NAW (Months 2-6; P < 0.0001). Sustained improvement (P < 0.0001, all time points) was observed in morning sleepiness and ability to concentrate (P = 0.0014, month 6) with zolpidem extended-release compared with placebo. Most frequent adverse events for zolpidem extended-release were headache, anxiety and somnolence. No rebound effect was observed during the first 3 nights of discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish the efficacy of 3 to 7 nights per week dosing of zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg for up to 6 months. Treatment provided sustained and significant improvements in sleep onset and maintenance and also improved next-day concentration and morning sleepiness.""",1

In patients treated with RT alone, initial local control rate was 72% for tumors involving supraglottic larynx and 90% for glottic larynx; in postoperative RT patients, the rate was 65% in the supraglottic and 67% in the glottic larynx group. The laryngeal preservation rate in patients treated with RT alone was 87% in those with early lesions (T1 and T2) and 63% in those with advanced tumors (T3 and T4). The overall five-year determinate survival rates of the RT-only group and the postoperative RT group were 90% and 57%, respectively. In patients with advanced tumors (stages III and IV), survival rates were comparable for RT alone and postoperative RT (56% and 52%, respectively). ",0
2369,24306680,Biochemical analysis of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint with magnetic resonance T2 mapping: a feasibility study,"Symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction can seriously compromise patients' quality of life. The aim of our study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping of the articular disc to determine whether T2 mapping of the TMJ disc is feasible in routine clinical imaging and to assess the normal T2 relaxation time distribution within the TMJ. Included were ten asymptomatic volunteers without pain, any mouth-opening limitations, or any clicking phenomena. MR imaging was performed on a 3-T MR scanner using a flexible, dedicated, eight-channel multielement coil. T2 mapping was performed in the oblique sagittal plane. The regions of interest (ROIs) for the T2 relaxation time maps of the disc were selected manually. The mean values for ROIs ranged between 22.4 and 28.8 ms, and the mean for all ROIs was 26.0 ± 5.0 ms. Intraclass correlation (ICC) for interobserver variability was 0.698, and ICC for intraobserver variability was 0.861. There was no statistically significant difference between raters (p = 0.091) or sides (p = 0.810). The T2 mapping technique enables ultrastructural analysis of the composition of TMJ disc. This biochemical technique is feasible in vivo, as shown in our study, when a high-field (3 T) MR and a dedicated TMJ coil are used. T2 mapping as a biochemical technique, together with morphological MRI, may help to gain more insights into the physiology and into the pathophysiology of the articular disc in the TMJ noninvasively and in vivo.

2370,12189369,Risk factors for antituberculous chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity in Japanese pediatric patients,"""OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to clarify risk factors associated with the development of severe hepatotoxicity during antituberculosis chemotherapy in Japanese children. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis in a 350-bed referral children's hospital in a metropolitan area, the medical charts of all pediatric patients who received antituberculosis chemotherapy between January 1995 and November 1999 were surveyed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to find any demographic parameters (ie, sex, age, height, and body weight), clinical characteristics (ie, nutritional or developmental status, co-infection with hepatitis viruses [B or C] or human immunodeficiency virus, presence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, or medical history of liver disease), or individual antituberculosis agents used that would be associated with the likelihood of development of severe hepatotoxicity during antituberculous chemotherapy. Severe hepatotoxicity (defined as an elevation of ALT and AST levels that were greater than 5 times the respective reference values) was attributed to the chemotherapy when it developed in children with normal pretreatment values for these parameters and no other potential causes were identified. Those who had abnormal ALT or AST values before treatment were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Among the 117 patients surveyed (58 males and 59 females; age range, 0 to 16 years), 18 were excluded from the analysis because of abnormal baseline ALT and AST values. Severe hepatotoxicity developed in 8 of the 99 eligible children, and all 8 of those children were younger than 5 years old. The univariate analysis revealed that the children in whom hepatotoxicity developed were significantly (P <.05) younger, were predominantly male, had extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and were given pyrazinamide more often than those who had no hepatotoxicity. However, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only age and the administration of pyrazinamide would have a significant contribution (P <.05) to the development of severe hepatotoxicity, with odds ratios of 143 (95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 4934.9) and 0.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.90), respectively: the estimated probability of development of hepatotoxicity in a typical pediatric patient at 1, 5, and 10 years receiving pyrazinamide with rifampin (INN, rifampicin) and isoniazid would be 0.95, 0.72, and 0.16, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that intensive monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be performed for younger children (<5 years) receiving pyrazinamide for antituberculosis chemotherapy.""",1
2371,11391531,Induction of Mdr1b expression by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in rat liver cells is independent of p53 but requires NF-kappaB signaling,"The multidrug resistance protein Mdr1b in rats is up-regulated during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or after endotoxin treatment. We hypothesize that up-regulation of Mdr1b in these models is TNF-alpha-dependent. The mechanism of Mdr1b activation by TNF-alpha is unknown as TNF-alpha can signal through various pathways, including NF-kappaB and p53, transcription factors for which binding sites in the Mdr1b promoter have been identified. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of up-regulation of Mdr1b by TNF-alpha. We selectively used constructs expressing dominant negative Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), TNF receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) or IkappaB to inhibit pathways downstream of the TNF receptor. Further, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was used, which prevents the breakdown of IkappaB. We show a critical role for NF-kappaB in activation of Mdr1b gene expression both in primary rat hepatocytes and in rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cells. Because p53 is up-regulated by TNF-alpha in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner and the Mdr1b promoter contains a p53 binding site, we used liver cells expressing a dominant negative p53 to show that TNF-alpha up-regulation of Mdr1b is independent of functional p53. Using transient transfection assays, we show that Mdr1b up-regulation correlates with activation of the promoter. Mutation of the NF-kappaB site in the Mdr1b promoter prevents its induction by TNF-alpha. In conclusion our results show that activation of the rat Mdr1b gene by TNF-alpha is a result of NF-kappaB signaling and independent of p53.",0
2372,23386589,Wnt5a signaling mediates biliary differentiation of fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells in mice,"The molecular mechanisms regulating differentiation of fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells, called hepatoblasts, which play pivotal roles in liver development, remain obscure. Wnt signaling pathways regulate the development and differentiation of stem cells in various organs. Although a ?-catenin-independent noncanonical Wnt pathway is essential for cell adhesion and polarity, the physiological functions of noncanonical Wnt pathways in liver development are unknown. Here we describe a functional role for Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, in the differentiation of mouse hepatoblasts. Wnt5a was expressed in mesenchymal cells and other cells of wild-type (WT) midgestational fetal liver. We analyzed fetal liver phenotypes in Wnt5a-deficient mice using a combination of histological and molecular techniques. Expression levels of Sox9 and the number of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1?(+) HNF4?(-) biliary precursor cells were significantly higher in Wnt5a-deficient liver relative to WT liver. In Wnt5a-deficient fetal liver, in vivo formation of primitive bile ductal structures was significantly enhanced relative to WT littermates. We also investigated the function of Wnt5a protein and downstream signaling molecules using a three-dimensional culture system that included primary hepatoblasts or a hepatic progenitor cell line. In vitro differentiation assays showed that Wnt5a retarded the formation of bile duct-like structures in hepatoblasts, leading instead to hepatic maturation of such cells. Whereas Wnt5a signaling increased steady-state levels of phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in fetal liver, inhibition of CaMKII activity resulted in the formation of significantly more and larger-sized bile duct-like structures in vitro compared with those in vehicle-supplemented controls. CONCLUSION: Wnt5a-mediated signaling in fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells suppresses biliary differentiation. These findings also suggest that activation of CaMKII by Wnt5a signaling suppresses biliary differentiation. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;).",0
2373,25561169,"Structural insights into stereospecific reduction of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl substrates by old yellow enzyme from Gluconobacter oxydans","We report the crystal structure of old yellow enzyme (OYE) family protein Gox0502 (a.a 1-315) in free form at 3.3 Å. Detailed structural analysis revealed the key residues involved in stereospecific determination of Gox0502, such as Trp66 and Trp100. Structure-based computational analysis suggested the bulky side chains of these tryptophan residues may play important roles in product stereoselectivity. The introduction of Ile or Phe or Tyr mutation significantly reduced the product diastereoselectivity. We hypothesized that less bulky side chains at these critical residues could create additional free space to accommodate intermediates with different conformations. Notably, the introduction of Phe mutation at residue Trp100 increased catalytic activity compared to wild-type Gox0502 toward a set of substrates tested, which suggests that a less bulky Phe side chain at residue W100F may facilitate product release. Therefore, Gox0502 structure could provide useful information to generate desirable OYEs suitable for biotechnological applications in industry.  ",0

2376,1847350,Differences in glycolytic capacity and hypoxia tolerance between hepatoma cells and hepatocytes,"Viability, glycolytic capacity and energy metabolism under anaerobic conditions were studied in the hepatoma cell lines HTC, FU5 and HepG2 and in rat and human hepatocytes using glucose and fructose as glycolytic precursors. During 6 hr of anaerobic incubation without additional substrate, viability decreased rapidly in FU5 and HTC cells, whereas viability of HepG2 cells was not significantly affected. In all tumor cells, 10 mmol/L glucose prevented hypoxic cell injury almost completely. Lactate formation from glucose was about five times higher than in hepatocytes under these circumstances. ATP content of the tumor cells remained almost constant under anaerobic conditions in the presence of glucose. Ten millimoles per liter of fructose diminished glycolysis in the hepatoma cells compared with glucose, ranging from 87% reduction in HTC cells to 43% reduction in HepG2 cells. Accordingly, ATP content decreased rapidly in the FU5 and slowly in the HepG2 cells. Viability was strongly diminished in the HTC and FU5 cells in the presence of fructose, whereas in the HepG2 cells no effect of fructose on viability was detectable. In contrast to the hepatoma cells, rat and human hepatocytes exhibited higher rates of anaerobic glycolysis in the presence of fructose and thus were able to maintain their viability under these conditions. These differences in glycolytic capacity, energy metabolism and hypoxia tolerance of hepatoma cells compared with hepatocytes may be used for the treatment of liver cancer by isolated liver perfusion and ex situ revision of the organ.",0

We excluded patients who underwent alternative approaches to suprapubic catheter placement including open abdominal approach (12) and percutaneous approach (5). Preoperative patient demographics, operative detail, success rate and 30-day complication rate were recorded. We successfully placed an 18 Fr suprapubic catheter using the T-SPeC(®) device in 98.2 % of patients. During the procedure, the capture housing was missed twice. The mean patient age was 56.6, BMI 29.4 kg/m(2), skin to bladder distance 6.7 cm and operative time 3.6 min.

2378,9185755,Assessment of the role of activin A and transforming growth factor beta in the regulation of AML12 cell growth,"The present study was conducted to determine the role of two autocrine factors, activin A and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), in the growth regulation of AML12 hepatocytes. We overexpressed truncated type II activin and/or TGF-beta receptors in AML12 cells. In AML12 cells overexpressing truncated type II activin receptors (AML-tAR cells), the inhibitory effect of activin A on DNA synthesis was completely blocked. AML-tAR cells proliferated faster than parental cells, both in the presence and absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, AML-tAR cells could not grow in soft agar. Follistatin augmented EGF-induced DNA synthesis in AML12 cells, whereas it was ineffective in AML-tAR cells. In AML12 cells overexpressing truncated type II TGF-beta receptor (AML-tTR cells), the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on DNA synthesis was blocked. AML-tTR cells proliferated faster than parental cells, both in the presence and absence of EGF, but at a slower rate than that of AML-tAR cells. AML-tTR cells did not grow in soft agar. The growth rate of cells overexpressing both types of truncated receptors was identical to that of AML-tAR cells, and these cells did not grow in soft agar. These results indicate that both activin A and TGF-beta act as autocrine inhibitors of DNA synthesis in AML12 cells, and that the blocking of the actions of two factors does not lead to transformation. Activin A is a predominant autocrine factor in these cells.",0

HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to compare the antianginal efficacy of trapidil with that of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in patients with stable angina pectoris. METHODS: We studied 95 patients with stable angina pectoris who were randomized into a double-blind parallel group study with either oral trapidil or ISDN. After a 1-week run-in period and a 2-week wash-out phase, the patients received either trapidil 200 mg t.i.d. (n = 48) or ISDN 20 mg t.i.d. (n = 47) for 12 weeks. All antianginal medication, except sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), was discontinued during the study. Patients underwent an exercise electrocardiogram on an ergometer bicycle according to a modified Bruce protocol before and at 6 and 12 weeks during treatment. RESULTS: The workload capacity increased from 583 +/- 281 W.min before treatment to 833 +/- 444 W.min after 12 weeks of treatment in the trapidil group (p < 0.01) and from 555 +/- 276 W.min to 827 +/- 361 W.min in the ISDN group (p < 0.01). The anginal attacks per week as well as the use of GTN decreased significantly in both groups. After 12 weeks of therapy, the cumulative ST-segment depression during exercise decreased by 67% in the trapidil patients and by 23% in the ISDN patients. Compared with baseline, the double product at the 75 W level was reduced in both groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate at rest remained nearly unchanged. Overall, no statistical difference was found between the two study groups. The tolerability was good.

A comparison of hospital use in the United States and Canada,"In an effort to determine how lower health care expenditures in Canada as compared with the United States translate into actual hospital services received, we examined discharge rates, lengths of stay, and the case-mix index (calculated from diagnosis-related group weights) for those 65 years of age and older hospitalized with cardiovascular disease in the United States and two Canadian provinces, Manitoba and Ontario, in 1981 and 1985. We expected that the effect of the prospective payment system might be reflected in changes between 1981 and 1985. Discharge rates for medical treatment of cardiovascular diseases were 2.9 percent higher in the United States than in Canada in 1981, but 1.8 percent lower in 1985; however, the case-mix index was 3.0 percent lower in 1981 and 4.8 percent higher in 1985. The case-mix index for combined medical and surgical discharges was 5.0 percent lower in the United States in 1981, but 10.7 percent higher in 1985. U.S. surgical discharge rates were 20 percent lower in 1981, but 20 percent higher in 1985. Rates of coronary bypass surgery were much higher in the United States in both years, but increased rapidly in both countries, particularly among those 75 and older. Elderly Canadians appeared to have access to cardiovascular surgery, with the exception of coronary bypass surgery, and to other hospital care for cardiovascular disease similar to that of elderly people in the United States.",0
2383,2699137,Detection of lymph vessel changes in venous diseases of the leg using imaging procedures],"Chronic venous insufficiency reveals both functional correlations with the lymphatic system of the limbs as well as pathological-anatomical. The functional correlation initially consists in an enhancement of function as a manifestation of a compensation mechanism of lymphatic drainage in relation to the insufficient venous system. Finally, if the lymphatics are themselves damaged in their further course, a safety valve insufficiency occurs with resulting lymphostasis. Apart from this participation, regional damages to the lymphatic fascicles play a role in chronic venous insufficiency in trophic disorders, as for example leg ulcer and atrophy. However, these are far less significant for the overall function of lymphatic drainage. As a role, they show a pronounced collateralization, and thus good possibilities of functional compensation. In particular indirect lymphography with water-soluble contrast medium is suitable as imaging technique in diagnostics with regard to the morphology. Isotope lymphography is suitable with regard to investigating the function of lymphatic drainage and for circumscribed local disorders. As native techniques, xeroradiography and computed tomography are very suitable to analyse tissue damage of the cutis and subcutis resulting from chronic venous insufficiency and from lymphostasis and to make indirect inferences from this with regard to the chronicity of this disease process.

2385,29782209,Practical Assessment and Management of Vulnerabilities in Older Patients Receiving Chemotherapy: ASCO Guideline for Geriatric Oncology,"Purpose To provide guidance regarding the practical assessment and management of vulnerabilities in older patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods An Expert Panel was convened to develop clinical practice guideline recommendations based on a systematic review of the medical literature. Results A total of 68 studies met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. Recommendations In patients ≥ 65 years receiving chemotherapy, geriatric assessment (GA) should be used to identify vulnerabilities that are not routinely captured in oncology assessments. Evidence supports, at a minimum, assessment of function, comorbidity, falls, depression, cognition, and nutrition. The Panel recommends instrumental activities of daily living to assess for function, a thorough history or validated tool to assess comorbidity, a single question for falls, the Geriatric Depression Scale to screen for depression, the Mini-Cog or the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test to screen for cognitive impairment, and an assessment of unintentional weight loss to evaluate nutrition. Either the CARG (Cancer and Aging Research Group) or CRASH (Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients) tools are recommended to obtain estimates of chemotherapy toxicity risk; the Geriatric-8 or Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 can help to predict mortality. Clinicians should use a validated tool listed at ePrognosis to estimate noncancer-based life expectancy ≥ 4 years. GA results should be applied to develop an integrated and individualized plan that informs cancer management and to identify nononcologic problems amenable to intervention. Collaborating with caregivers is essential to implementing GA-guided interventions. The Panel suggests that clinicians take into account GA results when recommending chemotherapy and that the information be provided to patients and caregivers to guide treatment decision making. Clinicians should implement targeted, GA-guided interventions to manage nononcologic problems. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines . ",0
2386,12531167,Efficacy and safety of herbal stimulants and sedatives in sleep disorders,"""World-wide use of herbal medicines is increasing, following regulatory and manufacturing developments. Herbs are attractive alternative medications to many patients with sleep disorders, who may be averse to using conventional drugs. We review here the most common herbal stimulants and sedatives. Caffeine, in herbal teas, black tea, coffee, soft drinks and pharmaceuticals, is used widely to control sleepiness, but more research is needed on its use in sleep disorders. Ephedra, and its constituent ephedrine, are used in both stimulant and weight loss preparations, sometimes with caffeine; safety concerns have arisen with this practice. Yohimbe is another herb used in stimulant and body-building preparations which has safety concerns. Asian and Siberian ginseng have been traditionally used for fatigue, and have some supportive experimental evidence for this use. Herbal sedatives also have some evidence for efficacy; the observations that certain plant flavonoid compounds bind to benzodiazepine receptors adds interest to their use. Valerian and kava have received the most research attention; both have decreased sleep onset time and promoted deeper sleep in small studies, and kava also shows anxiolytic effects. German chamomile, lavender, hops, lemon balm and passionflower are reputed to be mild sedatives but need much more experimental examination.""",1

It is a potent dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, which preferentially binds to the D3 receptor. Cariprazine also has partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. In September 2015, cariprazine received its first global approval in the USA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It is also in development in a variety of countries for the treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms (phase III), as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (phase II/III) and for the treatment of bipolar depression (phase II). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of cariprazine leading to this first approval for schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.",1
2388,17176621,Safety profile of proton pump inhibitors according to the spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions,"OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To evaluate similarities and differences in safety among proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) under the usual conditions of prescription. METHODS: A search of spontaneous reports on adverse reactions associated with these drugs and registered between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 was undertaken in the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System Database. We compared the frequency of reports with the consumption of PPIs, and analyzed the organ and system distribution for each PPI. Of the organ and system groups more commonly affected, diarrhea, myalgia, abnormal vision and hepatitis were selected for further analysis. RESULTS: Nearly 8 times more reports for omeprazole compared to other drugs were found but a similar difference was observed in their consumption. Skin and appendage disorders were more frequently reported for omeprazole and rabeprazole, the urinary, female reproductive and endocrine systems for lansoprazole, musculoskeletal for omeprazole and esomeprazole, vision for pantoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole, gastrointestinal tract for omeprazole and lansoprazole and liver and biliary systems for omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole. Myalgia appears more often in younger patients than diarrhea, abnormal vision or hepatitis and shows longer periods of latency and recovery. The four adverse reactions analyzed were mainly reversible. CONCLUSION: A direct relationship was found between consumption and the number of reports. Some organ and system groups were affected by more than one PPI and this showed a specific pattern of group toxicity to these pharmacological agents. Some reports involved only lansoprazole and these require further analysis.",1
2389,17518370,The mannose receptor on murine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is the main denatured collagen clearance receptor,"The purpose of this study was to identify the receptor responsible for endocytosis of denatured collagen from blood. The major site of clearance of this material (at least 0.5 g/day in humans) is a receptor on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). We have now identified an 180-kDa endocytic receptor on LSECs, peptide mass fingerprinting of which revealed it to be the mannose receptor. Challenge of mannose-receptor knockout mice and their cultured LSECs revealed significantly reduced blood clearance and a complete absence of LSEC endocytosis of denatured collagen. Organ analysis of wild-type versus knockout mice after injection of denatured collagen revealed significantly reduced liver uptake in the knockout mice. Clearance/endocytosis of ligands for other receptors in these animals was as that for wild-type mice, and denatured collagen uptake in wild-type mice was not affected by other ligands of the mannose receptor, namely mannose and mannan. Furthermore, unlike that of mannose and mannan, endocytosis of denatured collagen by the mannose receptor is calcium independent. This suggests that the binding site for denatured collagen is distinct from that for mannose/mannan. Mannose receptors on LSECs appear to have less affinity for circulating triple helical type I collagen. CONCLUSION: The mannose receptor is the main candidate for being the endocytic denatured collagen receptor on LSECs.",0

2391,14561005,Fatal cholestatic liver failure associated with gemcitabine therapy,"Drug-induced hepatotoxicity accounts for more than a third of the cases of acute liver failure in the United States. In complex medical conditions, the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury may be confounding and, specifically, the potential hepatotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents may be easily overlooked. Two fatal cases of cholestatic hepatotoxicity have been previously reported, clearly implicating gemcitabine therapy. We report a third fatal case of cholestatic liver failure that we think is strongly linked to the use of gemcitabine. This chemotherapeutic agent is a fluorine analog with broad-spectrum antitumor activity commonly used in the treatment of breast, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer. The case we report is of a 45-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer to her spine. The patient was in remission for two years before she presented with a compensated mixed hepatitis of mild to moderate severity. Inpatient work-up found metastases to the right humerus and inferior pubic ramus, but none in the liver. Gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy was initiated for relapse of breast cancer. The patient's liver enzyme elevation diminished, but did not normalize before the start of chemotherapy. She received four courses of gemcitabine/carboplatin and subsequently presented with decompensated, severe cholestatic hepatitis. Transjugular liver biopsy displayed marked cholestasis and hepatocellular injury consistent with drug-induced hepatoxicity. Gemcitabine has been extensively studied in the oncology literature and at this time is thought to be a low-risk hepatotoxin causing hepatic adaptation and transient, reversible liver enzyme elevation, rarely leading to termination of gemcitabine therapy for solid tumors. We believe that gemcitabine therapy, particularly in the setting of preexisting liver injury or metastases to the liver, increases the relative risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic injury possibly by idiosyncratic and dose-dependent mechanisms. We recommend careful monitoring and dose adjustment of gemcitabine in patients with abnormal liver function tests or evidence of hepatic metastases until further study clarifies this issue.",1
2392,7511127,"Role of Na,K-ATPase in regulating acidification of early rat liver endocytic vesicles","Endocytic vesicles are acidified by an electrogenic proton pump and a parallel chloride conductance; however, acidification might be decreased if electrogenic transporters, such as Na,K-ATPase, that increase vesicle interior-positive membrane potential were also present. We examined this issue in early rat liver endosomes using ion substitution and inhibitors to alter Na,K-ATPase activity. These early endosomes, labeled for 2 min with the fluorescent fluid-phase marker fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, consistently acidified faster than endosomes similarly labeled for a 10-min period. In chloride-free media initial rates of acidification of early endosomes were faster in K+ media than in Na+ medium, although addition of K+ to Na+ or Na+ to K+ media to allow Na,K-ATPase to function did not decrease the rate of acidification. In chloride-containing media, rates were the same regardless of cation composition. The Na,K-ATPase inhibitor vanadate was prepared from orthovanadate by several methods, all of which inhibited liver ATPase activity. Two hundred mumol/L vanadate, prepared Cl(-)-free, tended to decrease rates of acidification in all media tested and these effects achieved statistical significance in Cl(-)-free media containing 150 mmol/L K+ or mixtures of Na+ and K+ and in 145 mmol/L KCl/5 mmol/L NaCl medium. Vanadate stocks pH-adjusted with hydrogen chloride increased rates of acidification in sodium gluconate buffers, probably as a result of the effects of the included Cl-. Five mmol/L ouabain (loaded into vesicles by endocytosis) and the membrane-permeable analog strophanthidin (2 mmol/L) both markedly inhibited endosome acidification, regardless of buffer ion composition. Collectively, these results suggest that Na,K-ATPase does not regulate acidification of rat liver early endocytic vesicles, that vanadate may modestly inhibit endosome acidification and that ouabain at high concentrations may inhibit acidification from the vesicle interior face.",0
2393,18324916,Significance of GLUT1 expression in adenocarcinoma and adenoma of the ampulla of Vater,"The expression of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) in malignant tumors is increased due to the higher metabolic needs of the proliferating cell populations. Aberrant GLUT1 expression is exhibited in a wide spectrum of epithelial malignancies and their precursors, which occur with low frequency and intensity; aberrant GLUT1 expression does not occur in normal epithelial cells. The expression of GLUT1 in tumors of the ampulla of Vater was evaluated on immunohistochemistry, and the relationships of GLUT1 expression to histological parameters and p53 expression were analyzed. Twenty-one (58.3%) of 36 adenocarcinomas and three (17.6%) of 17 adenomas had GLUT1 immunoreactivity. None of the regenerating or normal epithelia had any immunoreactivity. No significant relationships were found between GLUT1 expression and histological parameters or p53 expression. It was found that histological subtypes originated from different epithelium were strongly related to different macroscopic types. In the ampulla of Vater, GLUT1 expression was associated with malignant change, and might be a useful marker of malignancy. ",0
2394,25565925,Common somatic alterations identified in maffucci syndrome by molecular karyotyping,"Maffucci syndrome (MS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple central cartilaginous tumors (enchondromas) in association with cutaneous spindle cell hemangiomas. These patients have a high incidence of malignant transformation. No familial case is known and the etiopathogenic cause remains unknown. In enchondromatosis (Ollier disease, OD), which is comprised of enchondromas only, 4 mutations in the PTHR1 gene have been identified in 4 patients; 3 were somatic and 1 was germline. No PTHR1 mutations have been detected in MS, whereas somatic IDH1 and, more rarely, IDH2 mutations have been observed in 77% of patients with MS and 81% of patients with OD. These genetic alterations are shared with other tumors, including glioma, leukemia and carcinoma. To search for underlying somatic genomic causes, we screened MS tissues using Affymetrix SNP-chips. We looked for CNVs, LOH and uniparental isodisomy (UPID) by performing pairwise analyses between allelic intensities in tumoral DNA versus the corresponding blood-extracted DNA. While common chromosomal anomalies were absent in constitutional DNA, several shared CNVs were identified in MS-associated tumors. The most frequently encountered somatic alterations were localized in 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, implicating these chromosomal rearrangements in the formation of enchondromas and spindle cell hemangiomas in MS. In one chondrosarcoma specimen, large amplifications and/or deletions were observed in chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19. Some of these genetic changes have been reported in other chondrosarcomas suggesting an etiopathogenic role. No LOH/UPID was observed in any Maffucci tissue. Our findings identify frequent somatic chromosomal rearrangements on 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, which may unmask mutations leading to the lesions pathognomonic of MS.  ",0
2395,15073958,Omeprazole-induced hepatotoxicity? A case report,"CASE REPORT: We observed a serious symptomatic hepatocellular liver injury in an 85-year-old man treated with omeprazole for many years. Peak values for AST, ALT and AP were 1542 U/l (normal range 14-50), 1236 U/l (11-60) and 154 U/l (30-125) respectively. Abdominal CT scan was normal and viral serologic testing was negative. Omeprazole was discontinued and liver enzymes normalized in 12 days. The patient was known to suffer from ischemic heart disease and had had a myocardial infarction 6 months previously. He was reexposed to omeprazole and the level of liver enzymes rose again and normalized after stopping omeprazole. Despite the improvement of his liver function, the patient died 5 days later due to chronic congestive heart failure. DISCUSSION: Five cases of omeprazole-induced liver injury have been reported to the Swiss Drug Regulatory Agency since 1990, among them two of cholestatic hepatitis and one of hepatic failure. The WHO Data Base has collected 13,630 ADRs related to omeprazole, with more than 80 cases of hepatitis, 60 of jaundice and about 40 of cholestatic hepatitis. In contrast, only one case of severe symptomatic hepatotoxicity is described in the literature. Clinical studies reported minimal increase of liver enzymes only, in 1-5% of cases. CONCLUSION: This case with reexposure, together with those reported internationally, suggests that hepatitis is a possible but obviously rare complication of omeprazole treatment.",1
2396,6434025,Acute cholecystitis and thiazides,"Drugs purchased by a random sample (17 000) of the population of J?mtland county, Sweden, are continuously monitored. Patients who had been admitted to the county's only hospital with acute cholecystitis and who were part of this sample were studied, and controls matched for age and sex were drawn from the sample. The purchase of thiazides and other drugs prescribed to the patients with acute cholecystitis was compared with that of the controls. The estimated relative risk of developing acute cholecystitis in patients who had purchased thiazides in the year before admission to hospital, as compared with those who had not, was 2.1 (95% confidence limit 1.1-3.9). As it has been reliably reported that the use of thiazides is not itself associated with cholelithiasis, the association found between thiazides and cholecystitis suggests that thiazides may increase the risk of acute cholecystitis developing in a patient with gall stones.",1
2397,16186239,Restoration of virulence of escape mutants of H5 and H9 influenza viruses by their readaptation to mice,"Antigenic mapping of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule of H5 and H9 influenza viruses by selecting escape mutants with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies and subjecting the selected viruses to immunological analysis and sequencing has previously been performed. The viruses used as wild-type strains were mouse-adapted variants of the original H5 and H9 isolates. Phenotypic characterization of the escape mutants revealed that the amino acid change in HA that conferred resistance to a monoclonal antibody was sometimes associated with additional effects, including decreased virulence for mice. In the present study, the low-virulence H5 and H9 escape mutants were readapted to mice. Analysis of the readapted variants revealed that the reacquisition of virulence was not necessarily achieved by reacquisition of the wild-type HA gene sequence, but was also associated either with the removal of a glycosylation site (the one acquired previously by the escape mutant) without the exact restoration of the initial wild-type amino acid sequence, or, for an H5 escape mutant that had no newly acquired glycosylation sites, with an additional amino acid change in a remote part of the HA molecule. The data suggest that such 'compensating' mutations, removing the damaging effects of antibody-selected amino acid changes, may be important in the course of influenza virus evolution. ",0

DESIGN: Prospective, double masked, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three ophthalmology centres in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 131 patients (mean age 81) with wet age related macular degeneration randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. INTERVENTIONS: Intravitreous bevacizumab (1.25 mg, three loading injections at six week intervals followed by further treatment if required at six week intervals) or standard treatment available at the start of the trial (photodynamic treatment with verteporfin for predominantly classic type neovascular age related macular degeneration, or intravitreal pegaptanib or sham treatment for occult or minimally classic type neovascular age related macular degeneration). PRIMARY OUTCOME: proportion of patients gaining >or=15 letters of visual acuity at one year (54 weeks). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: proportion of patients with stable vision and mean change in visual acuity. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients enrolled in the trial, five patients did not complete the study because of adverse events, loss to follow-up, or death. In the bevacizumab group, 21 (32%) patients gained 15 or more letters from baseline visual acuity compared with two (3%) in the standard care group (P<0.001); the estimated adjusted odds ratio was 18.1 (95% confidence interval 3.6 to 91.2) and the number needed to treat was 4 (3 to 6). In addition, the proportion of patients who lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity from baseline was significantly greater among those receiving bevacizumab treatment (91% (59) v 67% (44) in standard care group; P<0.001). Mean visual acuity increased by 7.0 letters in the bevacizumab group with a median of seven injections compared with a decrease of 9.4 letters in the standard care group (P<0.001), and the initial improvement at week 18 (plus 6.6 letters) was sustained to week 54. Among 65 patients treated with bevacizumab, there were no cases of endophthalmitis or serious uveitis related to the intervention. All end points with respect to visual acuity in the study eye at 54 weeks favoured bevacizumab treatment over standard care. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab 1.25 mg intavitreous injections given as part of a six weekly variable retreatment regimen is superior to standard care (pegaptanib sodium, verteporfin, sham), with low rates of serious ocular adverse events. Treatment improved visual acuity on average at 54 weeks. Trial registration number Current controlled trials ISRCTN83325075.""",1

Preliminary studies in two patients and two healthy volunteers given an initial 2-g oral dose of 5-FC demonstrated sustained serum 5-FU levels (>100 ng/ml) during the 5 h after ingestion of drug. Pharmaceutical preparations of 5-FC used in these studies were shown to be insignificantly contaminated with 5-FU (<0.03%), suggesting in vivo conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU had occurred. Serum samples from seven patients with cryptococcal meningitis treated with amphotericin B and 5-FC were examined for 5-FU. Five of these patients had experienced hematological or other toxicity attributed to 5-FC at some time during the course of therapy. Of 41 serum samples, 20 were observed to have 5-FU levels greater than 1,000 ng/ml in the range observed with cancer chemotherapeutic doses of 5-FU known to be associated with hematological toxicity. It is concluded that conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU occurs in humans and furthermore that 5-FU may account for some of the toxicity observed with 5-FC.",1

METHODS: Patients with tuberculosis (30 HIV positive and 132 HIV negative), aged between 18 and 80 years-old, admitted to hospital in Brazil, from 2005 to 2007, were selected for this investigation. Three definitions of hepatotoxicity were used: I) a 3-fold increase in the lower limit of normal for alanine-aminotransferase (ALT); II) a 3-fold increase in the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT, and III) a 3-fold increase in the ULN for ALT plus a 2-fold increase in the ULN of total bilirubin. RESULTS: In groups with and without HIV infection the frequency of hepatotoxicity I was 77% and 46%, respectively (p < 0.01). Using hepatotoxicity II and III definitions no difference was observed in the occurrence of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. Of the 17 patients with hepatotoxicity by definition III, 3 presented no side effects and treatment was well tolerated. In 8 (36.4%) out of 22, symptoms emerged and treatment was suspended. Alcohol abuse was related to hepatotoxicity only for definition I. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the definition of drug-induced hepatitis, HIV infection may or may not be associated with hepatotoxicity. The impact that minor alterations in the definition had on the results was impressive. No death was related to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The emergence of new symptoms after initiating antituberculosis therapy could not be attributed to hepatotoxicity in over one third of the cases.""",1

2403,14767989,PAR1 antagonism protects against experimental liver fibrosis. Role of proteinase receptors in stellate cell activation,"In fibroblasts, thrombin induces collagen deposition through activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor, proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR(1)). In the current study, we examined whether PAR(1) antagonism inhibits hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation in vitro and whether it protects against fibrosis development in a rodent model of cirrhosis. A rat HSC line was used for in vitro studies whereas cirrhosis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). The current results demonstrated that HSCs express PAR(1), as well as proteinase-activated receptors 2 (PAR(2)) and 4 (PAR(4)), and that all three PARs were up-regulated in response to exposure to growth factor in vitro. Exposure to thrombin and to SFLLRN-(SF)-NH(2), a PAR(1) agonist, and GYPGKF (GY)-NH(2), a PAR(4) agonist, triggered HSC proliferation and contraction, as well as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) production and collagen I synthesis and release. These effects were inhibited by the PAR(1) antagonist. Administration of this antagonist, 1.5 mg/kg/d, to BDL rats reduced liver type I collagen messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and surface collagen by 63%, as measured by quantitative morphometric analysis. Similarly, hepatic and urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was reduced significantly by the PAR(1) antagonist. In conclusion, PAR(s) regulates HSC activity; development of PAR antagonists might be a feasible therapeutic strategy for protecting against fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases.",0

During a 5-year period, from January 2001 to December 2005, 1,485 primary brain and spinal tumors in children up to 17 years of age were diagnosed histopathologically according to the World Health Organization 2000 nervous system tumor classification. The sex predilection, tumor location, and histological grade in relation to age were investigated, and the epidemiological characteristics of the 5 most common brain tumors are discussed. Of the 1,485 cases evaluated, brain and spinal tumors comprised 92.3% (1,371) and 7.7% (114), respectively, with a predominance of low-grade tumors (65.1 and 78.9% for brain and spinal cord, respectively). For all tumors, the overall sex ratio (male to female) was 1.6:1. 61.9% of the brain tumors were supratentorial, whereas an infratentorial location was slightly more common in the 872 brain tumors of neuroepithelial tissue (53.7%). The 5 most common brain tumors were astrocytic tumors (30.5%), craniopharyngiomas (18.4%), medulloblastomas (14.6%), germ cell tumors (GCTs, 7.9%) and ependymal tumors (5.6%).

2406,25559313,Abdominal oxygen saturation for monitoring return of spontaneous circulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using near infrared spectrophometry,We used near-infrared spectrophotometry to assess the initial and final abdominal and cerebral saturations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to determine if there is a correlation between increase in these saturation values and return of spontaneous circulation. We evaluated 34 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without witnesses brought to our emergency department. Abdominal and cerebral saturations were measured using near-infrared spectrophotometry from the start of CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for a maximum of 30 minutes. The effect of abdominal saturations in patients with or without spontaneous circulation restored through CPR was then assessed. Thirty-four patients (17 males + females) with a mean age of 63.06 ± 11.66 years were included in the study. A significant correlation was determined between increase in abdominal saturations measured at the start and end of CPR and the return of spontaneous circulation (P < .001). A good positive correlation was also identified between abdominal saturation and return of spontaneous circulation. Patients with increased abdominal and cerebral saturation values have a higher survival rate after appropriate CPR. This noninvasive measurement system and monitoring of patients during CPR may be a good method of predicting return of spontaneous circulation and assessing abdominal perfusion. ,0

2408,2822795,"Effects of ACTH and cortisol administration on blood pressure, electrolyte metabolism, atrial natriuretic peptide and renal function in normal man","Both Adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and glucocorticoids raise blood pressure in man and animals, but the relationship of this and altered renal function to other cardiovascular variables, and the differences and similarities of the effects of the two agonists have not been fully explained. The present study compares the effects of ACTH (0.5 mg i.m; every 12 h) and cortisol (50 mg orally, every 6 h) in six normal men over a period of 5 days, preceded and followed by control periods of 3 and 2 days, respectively. Plasma cortisol levels were higher during ACTH treatment than during cortisol treatment. Both treatments raised blood pressure significantly and caused a marked antinatriuresis and expansion of extracellular fluid and plasma volume. ACTH also enhanced potassium excretion but this was less obvious for cortisol. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide rose to more than twice the basal level with both treatments. Both treatments markedly altered renal function. They raised glomerular filtration rate (GFR), i.e. inulin clearance (141% with ACTH; 113% with cortisol) although creatinine clearance was not changed, showing this to be an unreliable index during steroid administration. Filtration fraction (FF) also increased during both treatments, and renal blood flow (RBF) fell, although this achieved statistical significance only during cortisol treatment. Effective renal plasma flow [para-amino hippurate (PAH) clearance] remained unchanged while calculated renal vascular resistance increased. Fractional sodium reabsorption also rose but achieved statistical significance only during ACTH treatment. The similarity of response to treatment suggests that cortisol is largely responsible for the effects of ACTH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0

2410,23377559,Presentation and outcomes with clinically apparent interferon beta hepatotoxicity,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the presenting features and outcomes of consecutive patients with liver injury attributed to interferon beta. METHODS: The presenting features of eight subjects with clinically apparent liver injury attributed to interferon beta enrolled in the U.S. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective registry between 2004 and 2010 were reviewed and compared to 11 published reports of symptomatic hepatotoxicity. RESULTS: All eight of the DILIN patients were women, 75 % were Caucasian and the mean age was 49 years. Most subjects presented with an acute hepatocellular injury pattern and mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 725 ? 593 U/L. The median duration of interferon beta use before injury onset was 462 days, and four patients had been treated for more than a year. No patient had detectable antinuclear or smooth muscle antibodies. One patient died of acute liver failure and the remaining patients usually recovered within 2-3 months. Causality assessment scored three cases as definite, three highly likely, one probable and one possible. Eleven additional published cases were all women, mean age was 40 years, mean ALT at onset 840 U/L, and 7 (63 %) had autoantibodies. Liver histology in three cases from DILIN and nine from the literature commented upon centrilobular (zone 3) necrosis and infiltrates with lymphocytes and plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Interferon beta hepatotoxicity occurs mostly in women and has a variable, but often prolonged time to onset. Most patients have self-limited acute hepatocellular liver injury but several have required liver transplantation or died of acute liver failure. Liver histology available in three cases demonstrated zone 3 necrosis and autoimmune features suggestive of an immunologic basis to this adverse drug reaction.",1
2411,3541320,Hepatobiliary and pancreatic complications of cyclosporine therapy in 466 renal transplant recipients,"""Two hundred twenty-eight patients from a total of 466 (49%) receiving renal allografts under cyclosporine/prednisone (CsA/Pred) immunosuppression experienced at least one episode of posttransplant hepatotoxicity. All patients were documented to have normal serum bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (AP), as well as negative results of biliary ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal contrast examinations prior to transplantation. Hepatotoxic episodes usually were self-limited (82%), and generally occurred during the very early posttransplant period (76%). Liver function abnormalities included hyperbilirubinemia (48% of patients), elevated SGOT (47%), SGPT (73%), LDH (84%), and AP (59%). The CsA serum trough radioimmunoassay (RIA) was relatively high among hepatotoxic patients with a mean value of 225 +/- 17 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including bioavailability and drug clearance, were significantly altered among this group of patients. The management strategy of CsA dose reduction was effective; however, 11 patients (2.4%) developed biliary calculous disease posttransplant while under CsA/Pred immunosuppression. Seven patients had cholelithiasis, and two patients underwent choledochoduodenostomy because of primary choledocholithiasis. The results contrast with 279 renal transplant recipients from an overlapping nonrandomized group treated with azathioprine (Aza)/Pred in whom cholelithiasis was not identified. Pancreatic abnormalities were relatively common, but clinical pancreatic disease occurred in only six patients. There were two episodes of acute pancreatitis, three patients developed pancreatic abscess, and one patient developed a pancreatic pseudocyst. The apparent proclivity of CsA-treated patients to develop biliary calculous disease, and the occurrence of serious pancreatic complications in a small percentage of patients did not affect the majority of CsA-treated patients. They may, however, represent important problems associated with the use of this immunosuppressive agent.""",1
2412,7814381,Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNE1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein with sequence similarity to calnexin and calreticulin and functions as a constituent of the ER quality control apparatus,"We have used a polymerase chain reaction strategy to identify in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes of the mammalian calnexin/calreticulin family, and we have identified and isolated a single gene, CNE1. The protein predicted from the CNE1 DNA sequence shares some of the motifs with calnexin and calreticulin, and it is 24% identical and 31% similar at the amino acid level with mammalian calnexin. On the basis of its solubility in detergents and its lack of extraction from membranes by 2.5 M urea, high salt, and sodium carbonate at pH 11.5, we have established that Cne1p is an integral membrane protein. However, unlike calnexins, the predicted carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domain of Cne1p terminates directly. Furthermore, based on its changed mobility from 76 to 60 kDa after endoglycosidase H digestion Cne1p was shown to be N-glycosylated. Localization of the Cne1p protein by differential and analytical subcellular fractionation as well as by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that it was exclusively located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), despite the lack of known ER retention motifs. Although six Ca(2+)-binding proteins were detected in the ER fractions, they were all soluble proteins, and Ca2+ binding activity has not been detected for Cne1p. Disruption of the CNE1 gene did not lead to inviable cells or to gross effects on the levels of secreted proteins such as alpha-pheromone or acid phosphatase. However, in CNE1 disrupted cells, there was an increase of cell-surface expression of an ER retained temperature-sensitive mutant of the alpha-pheromone receptor, ste2-3p, and also an increase in the secretion of heterologously expressed mammalian alpha 1-antitrypsin. Hence, Cne1p appears to function as a constituent of the S. cerevisiae ER protein quality control apparatus. ",0

Itraconazole undergoes rapid metabolism to form hydroxyitraconazole, which also contributes to the anti-fungal activity exhibited by the parent compound. Since both itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole are effective inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and p-glycoprotein (pgp)-mediated efflux transporters, they have the potential to elicit drug-drug interaction with a number of CYP3A4 and/or pgp substrates. This review focuses on providing comprehensive details on the bioanalytical methods available for the quantitation of both itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole. Additionally, it provides an overview of the clinical pharmacology (several case studies of drug-drug interactions), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and metabolism related aspects of itraconazole.

2414,8690407,Interferon gamma protects against hepatic tumor growth in rats by increasing Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity,"An increasing number of hepatic resections are being performed as potentially curative surgery for malignant liver neoplasms. Hepatectomy and subsequent liver regeneration produce a local environment that enhances growth of microscopic residual tumor. To determine if pretreatment with murine interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) can protect against such enhanced tumor growth, Buffalo rats were randomized to receive a 3-day treatment of IFN-gamma (50,000 U/qD intraperitoneally) or saline. Groups then underwent intrasplenic injection of 10(6) Morris hepatoma cells, followed 1 hour later by sham (control) or partial hepatectomy (PH) of 70%. PH significantly enhanced tumor growth within the liver (control, 8 +/- 3 nodules per liver; PH, 73 +/- 12 nodules per liver; P < .001). This enhancement was attenuated by prior administration of IFN-gamma IFN-gamma/PH, 16 +/- 3; P < .001 vs. PH). Growth factor release and liver regeneration were not affected significantly by pretreatment with IFN-gamma. The effect of IFN-gamma on tumor growth is associated with a significant enhancement of Kupffer cell (KC)-mediated tumoricidal activity (percentage of specific lysis, 55 +/- 10% control, 78 +/- 11% IFN-gamma, P < .01) but not lymphocyte-mediated tumoricidal activity. Because microscopic residual disease may be present after hepatectomies for cancer, IFN-gamma may be useful agent in retarding growth of residual tumors.",0
2415,18760136,Dronedarone for the control of ventricular rate in permanent atrial fibrillation: the Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for the cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) study,"""BACKGROUND: Dronedarone is a new multichannel blocker for atrial fibrillation (AF) previously demonstrated to have both rhythm and rate control properties in paroxysmal and persistent AF. The Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for The cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) trial assessed the efficacy of dronedarone in the control of ventricular rate in patients with permanent AF, when added to standard therapy. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multinational trial, dronedarone, 400 mg twice a day (n = 85), or matching placebo (n = 89) was administered for 6 months to adult patients with permanent AF, in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was the change in mean ventricular rate between baseline and day 14, as assessed by 24-hour Holter. Ventricular rate was also assessed during submaximal and maximal exercise. RESULTS: Dronedarone significantly decreased mean 24-hour ventricular rate. Compared with placebo, the mean treatment effect at day 14 was a reduction of 11.7 beats per minute (beat/min; P < .0001). Comparable reductions were sustained throughout the 6-month trial. During maximal exercise and compared to placebo, there was a mean reduction of 24.5 beat/min (P < .0001), without any reduction in exercise tolerance as measured by maximal exercise duration. The effects of dronedarone were additive to those of other rate-control agents, including beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and digoxin. Dronedarone was well tolerated, with no organ toxicities or proarrhythmia. CONCLUSION: In addition to its reported rhythm-targeting and rate-targeting therapeutic actions in paroxysmal and persistent AF, dronedarone improves ventricular rate control in patients with permanent AF. Dronedarone was well tolerated with no evidence of organ toxicities or proarrhythmias in this short-term study.""",1
2416,21256454,Treatment of patients with essential tremor,"Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most patients with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many patients abandon treatment because of side-effects or poor efficacy. A newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy (propranolol and primidone) produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighbouring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been done, and the best target is still uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighbouring subthalamic structures.",1
2417,19294929,Quantifying a dynamic risk landscape: heterogeneous predator activity and implications for prey persistence,"Spatial heterogeneity in predation risk can ameliorate impacts on prey populations, particularly for prey of generalists. Spatially heterogeneous risk implies the existence of refugia, and the spatial scale of those refugia and their persistence over time affect whether prey can avoid predation by aggregating therein. Our objective was to quantify the magnitude, spatial scale, and temporal persistence of heterogeneity in risk of predation by white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), an abundant generalist predator of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) and songbirds. We used track plates to measure white-footed mouse activity at > 170 trees in each of three forest plots in upstate New York during summers of 2003-2005. We quantified the mean and coefficient of variation of track activity among trees by fitting the beta-binomial distribution to data from each plot and study period. We measured temporal persistence by disattenuated autocorrelation, and spatial scale by fitting exponential variograms. Mice were much less abundant in 2005 than the other two years, leading to lower overall track activity but higher coefficient of variation among trees. Mouse track activity at individual trees was positively autocorrelated between monthly study periods in 2003 and 2004, and even between the two years, whereas temporal autocorrelation in 2005 was much weaker. Track activity showed positive spatial autocorrelation over lag distances from approximately 30 to > 1000 m. These findings indicate that mouse activity, and hence risk to their prey, varies substantially in space at spatial and temporal scales that appear responsive to mouse population dynamics. The spatial scale and temporal persistence of that variation imply that prey may benefit from returning to, or failing to disperse from, refugia. ",0

2419,29790842,Reviewing the WHO guidelines for antibiotic use for sepsis in neonates and children,"Background Guidelines from 2005 for treating suspected sepsis in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) recommended hospitalisation and prophylactic intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) ampicillin and gentamicin. In 2015, recommendations when referral to hospital is not possible suggest the administration of IM gentamicin and oral amoxicillin. In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, an updated review of the appropriate empirical therapy for treating sepsis (taking into account susceptibility patterns, cost and risk of adverse events) in neonates and children is necessary. Methods Systematic literature review and international guidelines were used to identify published evidence regarding the treatment of (suspected) sepsis. Results Five adequately designed and powered studies comparing antibiotic treatments in a low-risk community in neonates and young infants in LMIC were identified. These addressed potential simplifications of the current WHO treatment of reference, for infants for whom admission to inpatient care was not possible. Research is lacking regarding the treatment of suspected sepsis in neonates and children with hospital-acquired sepsis, despite rising antimicrobial resistance rates worldwide. Conclusions Current WHO guidelines supporting the use of gentamicin and penicillin for hospital-based patients or gentamicin (IM) and amoxicillin (oral) when referral to a hospital is not possible are in accordance with currently available evidence and other international guidelines, and there is no strong evidence to change this. The benefit of a cephalosporin alone or in combination as a second-line therapy in regions with known high rates of non-susceptibility is not well established. Further research into hospital-acquired sepsis in neonates and children is required. ",0

2421,3004186,Alterations in cardiovascular structure and function with advancing age,"The greatest difficulty in studying the effects of aging on cardiovascular structure and function lies in separating the effects of aging itself from those of the inextricably entwined disease processes and life-style changes that accompany aging. Age-related stiffening of the arterial tree results in an increased systolic blood pressure, which appears to impose a greater load on the heart. Probably as an adaptive mechanism to maintain normal wall stress, a modest age-associated concentric left ventricular hypertrophy develops, which approximates 30% between ages 25 and 80. The decrease in mitral valve E-F slope and increase in the left atrial dimension, which are seen with advancing age, may be construed as the consequences of a thicker-walled, less compliant left ventricle. Systolic left ventricular function, measured at rest either by echocardiography or radionuclide techniques, is unaffected by aging. Aerobic exercise capacity, whether measured as total work performance or maximal oxygen consumption declines with age, although in subjects who maintain a high level of physical activity, the decline appears to be approximately half of the 10% per decade decrease seen in sedentary persons. An age-related decline in maximal exercise heart rate has been a universal finding. Although several studies over the past 4 decades have found cardiac output to decrease with age, both at rest and during exercise, a recent study of subjects carefully screened to exclude latent coronary artery disease found no such decline in cardiac output. In these subjects, the age-related decline in maximal heart rate and systolic emptying at peak exercise was offset by an increased utilization of the Frank-Starling mechanism. An attractive hypothesis for explaining the hemodynamic profile of a decreased maximum heart rate, increased preload and decrease in ejection fraction at maximal effort, despite elevated norepinephrine levels, is an age-associated, diminished end-organ responsiveness similar to beta-adrenergic blockade.

2422,25006241,Invasive aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus terreus: an emerging opportunistic infection with poor outcome independent of azole therapy,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) caused by Aspergillus terreus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancy (HM). Very few data are available in this patient population to differentiate IA patients with A. terreus from those with non-terreus species of Aspergillus to compare outcomes. We retrospectively investigated 513 HM patients who were treated for either definite or probable IA between June 1993 and August 2012 in a cancer centre. We compared baseline characteristics, antifungal therapies and outcomes between patients infected with A. terreus (n = 96, 18.7%) and those infected with non-terreus Aspergillus species (n = 335, 65.3%). Eighty-one patients with mixed or unspecified Aspergillus infections were excluded. Breakthrough infections occurred more frequently in the A. terreus group (91% versus 77%, P = 0.009). A. terreus infection was associated with a lower rate of final response to antifungal therapy (21% versus 38%, P = 0.0015) and a higher rate of IA-associated mortality (51% versus 30%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that these associations were independent of patients' clinical characteristics and the antifungal regimens they received. Factors independently associated with final response included treatment with azoles (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.0, P < 0.0001) and Aspergillus species (A. terreus versus non-terreus Aspergillus species) (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.98, P = 0.043). Additionally, Aspergillus species and treatment with azoles were independently associated with IA-associated mortality. A. terreus IA in HM patients was associated with worse outcome than IA caused by non-terreus Aspergillus species. Poor prognosis in patients with invasive A. terreus infections is independent of anti-Aspergillus azole-based treatment. ",0
2423,1769657,"The cloned butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene maps to a single chromosome site, 3q26","Human tissues have two distinct cholinesterase activities: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase functions in the transmission of nerve impulses, whereas the physiological function of butyryl-cholinesterase remains unknown. An atypical form of butyrylcholinesterase or the absence of its activity leads to prolonged apnea following administration of the muscle relaxant suxamethonium. Inheritance of these butyrylcholinesterase variants is consistent with the enzyme activity being encoded in a single autosomal locus, BCHE (formerly CHE1 and E1), which has been assigned to chromosome 3. Previous in situ hybridization of a BCHE cDNA probe gave evidence of homologous sequences at 3q26 and 16q11-q23, raising the possibility of more than one locus coding for butyrylcholinesterase [H. Soreq, R. Zamir, D. Zevin-Sonkin, and H. Zakut (1987) Hum. Genet. 77: 325-328].

As a child, he had suffered a traumatic injury to his liver requiring the surgical repair of a laceration. This is the first reported case of hepatolithiasis during octreotide therapy. Gallstones and bile sludge are common side effects of octreotide therapy but rarely become symptomatic or require treatment. Hepatolithiasis is uncommon in western countries but is quite prevalent in East Asia and is often associated with a predisposing condition that causes intrahepatic bile stasis (eg. bile duct stricture). In addition to its known effect on gallbladder stasis, octreotide alters bile acid composition and may thus hasten intrahepatic sludge and stone formation. Extra caution should be taken in using octreotide or its long-acting analog in patients otherwise predisposed to intrahepatic bile stasis.",1
2425,28953427,Comparison of Strategies of Treatment with Ranibizumab in Newly-Diagnosed Cases of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"In several case-studies improved outcomes have been reported after switching from a pro-re-nata (PRN)- to a treat-and-extend (T&E)-based therapeutic approach in cases of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). We therefore wished to compare the effects of instigating 2 different protocols in newly-diagnosed nAMD undergoing treatment with Ranibizumab. The outcomes of a PRN- and a T&E-based regime were retrospectively compared in treatment-naïve eyes under therapy with Ranibizumab for minimally 12 months in a routine clinical setting. The primary outcome measures included the proportion of the eyes with intraretinal fluid in OCT and visual stability after the initial drug-loading phase. The comparative case-series included 107 eyes (PRN: 68; T&E: 39). During the 2-year follow-up period, a similar number of clinical examinations were performed in the 2 groups (PRN: 14.0 ± 6.2; T&E 13.4 ± 4.4; P = 0.97), whereas the number of injections that were administered differed for the first (PRN: 5.5 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 6.8 ± 2.4; P = 0.008) and the second year (PRN: 1.9 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 3.8 ± 2.3; P = 0.002). The proportion of eyes with intraretinal fluid after the initial drug-loading phase remained stable (PRN: from 33.8% to 36.4%; T&E: from 25.6% to 29.0%); so, too, did the central retinal thickness and the visual acuity. Despite a limited sample size, this retrospective analysis revealed the anatomical and the functional improvements during the 2-year follow-up period to be not roughly different for the 2 strategies. However, when the PRN-approach is instigated, the risk of under-treatment due to lapses in visits or to over-extensions in the intervals between treatments may be underestimated. ",0

This study prospectively investigated whether SN hyperechogenicity is also present in Huntington's disease (HD) patients with symptoms of hypokinesia and/or rigidity. All patients recruited to the study (n = 15) were characterised by hypokinesia and/or rigidity while nine of these patients also displayed chorea and/or dystonia. The control group included 15 individuals. Clinical examination was documented using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). TCS examination revealed SN hyperechogenicity in 14/15 (93.3 %) patients (9/14 unilateral, 5/14 bilateral). Hyperechogenicity of the caudate and lentiform nuclei (CN, LN) was less frequent (CN: 80 % total, LN: 53.3 % total). This is the first study to assess SN hyperechogenicity in hypokinetic HD patients. Assuming that the primary sites of pathology in IPD and HD are the SN and the striatum, respectively, our observations suggest a functional impairment of the nigrostriatal system in HD, an effect that is potentially independent of the primarily-affected basal ganglia nucleus.

Antibodies to hepatitis B (anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc) were found in 29.2% of patients with alcoholic liver disease, in 26.1% of hospitalized alcoholic patients without liver disease and in 24.2% of hospitalized nonalcoholic patients without liver disease; frequencies were not significantly different from one another. HBsAg was not evaluated because HBsAg+ patients had been excluded from the original trial.

In contrast, antibody to hepatitis C, as detected by enzyme immunoassay, was positive in 27.1%, 4.8% and 3.0% of the three groups, respectively, the first differing significantly from the other two. Antibody to hepatitis C virus positivity correlated significantly with clinical severity of the disease and with the presence of histological features that imply chronic viral infection (periportal inflammation, cirrhosis), despite the fact that the supplementary assay for antibody to hepatitis C virus, using recombinant immunoblot assay, reduced the positive rate by 79%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

2430,14523278,Case series of acute hepatitis in a non-selected group of HIV-infected patients on nevirapine-containing antiretroviral treatment,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics of patients who developed acute clinical hepatitis in an unselected outpatient population. METHODS: Patients who started a nevirapine-containing regimen in the period January 1999-February 2001 and presented with clinical symptoms in accordance with increased transaminase values within 12 weeks of initiation of nevirapine were considered possible cases of clinical hepatotoxicity. Patient characteristics, co-medicated drugs, HIV-1 RNA levels and clinical chemistry parameters were collected from outpatient medical records and clinical medical records. RESULTS: At the defined period, 306 patients started a nevirapine-containing regimen, of whom eight developed an acute hepatitis (2.6%) in a median of 24 days [interquartile range (IQR) 20-25 days]. Transaminases peaked at 28 days (IQR, 27-32 days). Injury pattern was in general mixed-hepatocellular. Withdrawal of the antiretroviral agent led to rapid restoration of transaminase levels and resolution of clinical symptoms. The reason for developing this hepatic reaction was not clear in every case as no specific risk factor(s) covering all patients in this case series could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is very important to monitor closely transaminase levels of all patients starting a nevirapine-containing regimen, including patients with no specific characteristics that put them at risk. The rapid onset of the clinical symptoms pleads for transaminase monitoring at a very early stage (i.e., within 2 weeks of initiation) of the nevirapine-containing regimen.",1
2431,15356306,Oral erythromycin and the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes,"BACKGROUND: Oral erythromycin prolongs cardiac repolarization and is associated with case reports of torsades de pointes. Because erythromycin is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) isozymes, commonly used medications that inhibit the effects of CYP3A may increase plasma erythromycin concentrations, thereby increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. We studied the association between the use of erythromycin and the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes and whether this risk was increased with the concurrent use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A. METHODS: We studied a previously identified Tennessee Medicaid cohort that included 1,249,943 person-years of follow-up and 1476 cases of confirmed sudden death from cardiac causes. The CYP3A inhibitors used in the study were nitroimidazole antifungal agents, diltiazem, verapamil, and troleandomycin; each doubles, at least, the area under the time-concentration curve for a CYP3A substrate. Amoxicillin, an antimicrobial agent with similar indications but which does not prolong cardiac repolarization, and former use of erythromycin also were studied, to assess possible confounding by indication. RESULTS: The multivariate adjusted rate of sudden death from cardiac causes among patients currently using erythromycin was twice as high (incidence-rate ratio, 2.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 3.75; P=0.03) as that among those who had not used any of the study antibiotic medications. There was no significant increase in the risk of sudden death among former users of erythromycin (incidence-rate ratio, 0.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.09; P=0.26) or among those who were currently using amoxicillin (incidence-rate ratio, 1.18; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 2.36; P=0.65). The adjusted rate of sudden death from cardiac causes was five times as high (incidence-rate ratio, 5.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 16.64; P=0.004) among those who concurrently used CYP3A inhibitors and erythromycin as that among those who had used neither CYP3A inhibitors nor any of the study antibiotic medications. In contrast, there was no increase in the risk of sudden death among those who concurrently used amoxicillin and CYP3A inhibitors or those currently using any of the study antibiotic medications who had formerly used CYP3A inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent use of erythromycin and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be avoided.",0
2432,28445677,Overexpression of the Cytokine BAFF and Autoimmunity Risk,"BACKGROUND: Genomewide association studies of autoimmune diseases have mapped hundreds of susceptibility regions in the genome. However, only for a few association signals has the causal gene been identified, and for even fewer have the causal variant and underlying mechanism been defined. Coincident associations of DNA variants affecting both the risk of autoimmune disease and quantitative immune variables provide an informative route to explore disease mechanisms and drug-targetable pathways. METHODS: Using case-control samples from Sardinia, Italy, we performed a genomewide association study in multiple sclerosis followed by TNFSF13B locus-specific association testing in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Extensive phenotyping of quantitative immune variables, sequence-based fine mapping, cross-population and cross-phenotype analyses, and gene-expression studies were used to identify the causal variant and elucidate its mechanism of action. Signatures of positive selection were also investigated. RESULTS: A variant in TNFSF13B, encoding the cytokine and drug target B-cell activating factor (BAFF), was associated with multiple sclerosis as well as SLE. The disease-risk allele was also associated with up-regulated humoral immunity through increased levels of soluble BAFF, B lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins. The causal variant was identified: an insertion-deletion variant, GCTGT?A (in which A is the risk allele), yielded a shorter transcript that escaped microRNA inhibition and increased production of soluble BAFF, which in turn up-regulated humoral immunity. Population genetic signatures indicated that this autoimmunity variant has been evolutionarily advantageous, most likely by augmenting resistance to malaria. CONCLUSIONS: A TNFSF13B variant was associated with multiple sclerosis and SLE, and its effects were clarified at the population, cellular, and molecular levels.

2433,28931876,Evidence that CA3 is Underling the Comorbidity Between Pain and Depression and the Co-curation by Wu-Tou decoction in Neuropathic Pain,"In neuropathic pain (NP), the atrophy of hippocampus contributes to the comorbidity between pain, depression and the cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism underling the comorbidity, the effective control of the degenerations in hippocampus and the remission of the accompanied depressive symptoms are still lacking. Wu-Tou decoction (WTD) has been prescribed for inflammatory pain for thousands of years. In this study, we manifested the effects of WTD on the pain, depression and anxiety co-curative symptoms of NP. Moreover, we reported that WTD rescued the mal-regulated BDNF and TNF-α in hippocampal CA3 alone, which is proven contributing to the pain and induced psychiatric symptoms. Finally, analysis of biochemistry, morphology and electrophysiology exhibited the potential mechanism of WTD in CA3. We found that, in the late stage of SNL condition, WTD mediated the rescue of the down-regulated glutamate as well as its pre-synaptic vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLuT1) and the post-synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in CA3. In sum, the targeted mediation of glutamatergic system in CA3 suggest that WTD may be responsible for the remission of the hypo-functioned CA3 glutamatergic neurons and further contribute to the co-curative effects of WTD.

2434,7707128,Subcutaneous injections of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine for symptomatic hairy cell leukemia,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) when administered by subcutaneous injection to patients with symptomatic hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and to evaluate predictive factors for response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients were given CdA as a subcutaneous injection once daily for 7 days. Complete remission (CR) required normalized blood counts and the absence of B-ly 7-positive bone marrow cells by flow cytometry. CdA concentrations in plasma following the first injection were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (81%) achieved a durable CR after one (n = 55) or two courses, and 10 had a partial remission (PR). With a median follow-up duration of 20 months, no patient had a clinical relapse. Neutropenic fever that required intravenous antibiotics occurred in 28 patients (38%). No toxicity at injection sites was observed. Incomplete response was predicted by an elevated lymphocyte count and serum beta 2-microglobulin level, and by a high percentage of hairy cells in the bone marrow. Plasma CdA levels were similar to those achieved from intravenous administration. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous injection of CdA is safe and as effective as continuous infusion without problems associated with the mode of administration. Our schedule simplifies CdA treatment and can be generally recommended.",1
2435,11919305,Estrogen-receptor polymorphisms and effects of estrogen replacement on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in women with coronary disease,"BACKGROUND: Sequence variants in the gene encoding estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) may modify the effects of hormone-replacement therapy on levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and other outcomes related to estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women. METHODS: We characterized 309 women with coronary artery disease who were enrolled in the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial with respect to eight previously described and two newly identified ER-alpha polymorphisms, and we examined the association between these polymorphisms and the response of HDL cholesterol and other lipids to treatment with estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, race, diabetes status, body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, and frequency of exercise, the 18.9 percent of the women who had the IVS1-401 C/C genotype (i.e., with C on both chromosomes in intervening sequence 1 at position 401 before exon 2) had an increase in the HDL cholesterol level with hormone-replacement therapy that was more than twice the increase observed in the other women (13.1 mg per deciliter vs. 6.0 mg per deciliter, P for treatment-by-genotype interaction = 0.004); this effect was limited to changes in the HDL subfraction 3 (HDL3) (P for interaction=0.04). Similar patterns of response were observed for three other highly linked ER-alpha intron 1 polymorphisms close to the IVS1-401 site (range of P values for interaction = 0.07 to 0.005). The pattern of increased response of HDL cholesterol in women with the IVS1-401 C/C genotype was evident in both the women receiving estrogen and those receiving estrogen plus progestin, was preserved across racial and ethnic groups, and was significant among women who were compliant with the study medication (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women with coronary disease who have the ER-alpha IVS1-401 C/C genotype, or several other closely related genotypes, have an augmented response of HDL cholesterol to hormone-replacement therapy.",0
2436,3762619,Relation of glucose tolerance to complications of pregnancy in nondiabetic women,"An increase in fetal and maternal complications has been documented in cases of gestational diabetes, but the glucose levels that predict an increased risk have not been clearly defined. We evaluated the frequency of several neonatal complications (macrosomia, congenital anomalies, perinatal mortality, and prematurity) and maternal complications (toxemia, cesarean section, or both) in relation to glucose tolerance in 249 women in the third trimester of pregnancy. None of the women had previous evidence of diabetes, and all had normal results on an oral glucose-tolerance test, according to accepted criteria. On the basis of their two-hour plasma glucose levels, women were divided into three groups: A (glucose less than 100 mg per deciliter), B (glucose 100 to 119 mg per deciliter), and C (glucose 120 to 164 mg per deciliter). The higher two-hour plasma glucose levels were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of macrosomia (9.9, 15.5, and 27.5 percent in Groups A, B, and C, respectively), congenital abnormalities (0.7, 3.5, and 5.0 percent), and toxemia, cesarean section, or both (19.9, 25.9, and 40.0 percent). A significant correlation between the infant's weight and the mother's two-hour plasma glucose level was also observed. These data indicate that even limited degrees of maternal hyperglycemia, which are currently considered to be within the normal range, may affect the outcome of pregnancy.",0
2437,18779236,Continuous glucose monitoring and intensive treatment of type 1 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: The value of continuous glucose monitoring in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus has not been determined. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial, we randomly assigned 322 adults and children who were already receiving intensive therapy for type 1 diabetes to a group with continuous glucose monitoring or to a control group performing home monitoring with a blood glucose meter. All the patients were stratified into three groups according to age and had a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 10.0%. The primary outcome was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level at 26 weeks. RESULTS: The changes in glycated hemoglobin levels in the two study groups varied markedly according to age group (P=0.003), with a significant difference among patients 25 years of age or older that favored the continuous-monitoring group (mean difference in change, -0.53%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.71 to -0.35; P<0.001). The between-group difference was not significant among those who were 15 to 24 years of age (mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.33; P=0.52) or among those who were 8 to 14 years of age (mean difference, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.11; P=0.29). Secondary glycated hemoglobin outcomes were better in the continuous-monitoring group than in the control group among the oldest and youngest patients but not among those who were 15 to 24 years of age. The use of continuous glucose monitoring averaged 6.0 or more days per week for 83% of patients 25 years of age or older, 30% of those 15 to 24 years of age, and 50% of those 8 to 14 years of age. The rate of severe hypoglycemia was low and did not differ between the two study groups; however, the trial was not powered to detect such a difference. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous glucose monitoring can be associated with improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Further work is needed to identify barriers to effectiveness of continuous monitoring in children and adolescents. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00406133.)",0

2440,31395532,Theoretical Value of Deceleration Capacity Points to Deceleration Reserve of Fetal Heart Rate,"The interpretation of Average Acceleration and Deceleration Capacities (AC/DC), computed through Phase-Rectified Signal Averaging (PRSA), in intrapartum fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is still matter of investigation. We aimed to elucidate some behaviours of AC/DC. We derived the theoretical value of PRSA for stationary stochastic Gaussian processes and proved that for these time series AC and DC are necessarily identical in absolute value. The difference between DC and AC, termed Deceleration Reserve (DR), was introduced to detect signals' asymmetric trends. DR was tested on FHR signals from: near-term pregnant sheep model of labor consisting of chronically hypoxic and normoxic fetuses with both groups developing acidemia due to umbilical cord occlusions (UCO); and the CTU-UHB dataset containing fetal CTG recordings collected during labor of newborns that resulted acidotic and non-acidotic, respectively. DR was compared with AC and DC in terms of discriminatory power (AUC), between the groups, after correcting for signals' power or deceleration area, respectively. DR displayed higher discriminatory power on the animal model during severe acidemia, with respect to AC/DC (p<0.05$ but also distinguished correctly all chronically hypoxic from normoxic fetuses at baseline prior to UCO. DR also outperformed AC/DC on the CTU-UHB dataset in distinguishing acidemic fetuses at birth (AUC: 0.65). Theoretical results motivated the introduction of DR, that proved to be superior than AC/DC for risk stratification during labor. DR, measured during labor, might permit to distinguish acidemic fetuses due to their different autonomic regulation, paving the way for new monitoring strategies. ",0
2441,12842950,Cohort study of hepatotoxicity associated with nimesulide and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of acute hepatotoxicity associated with nimesulide compared with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort and nested case-control study. SETTING: Umbria region, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: 400 000 current, recent, and past users (almost 2 million prescriptions) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admissions to hospital for acute non-viral hepatitis and incidence of all hepatopathies and liver injury among users of nimesulide and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: Current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was associated with a 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.1) increased risk of hepatopathy compared with past use. In current users of nimesulide the rate ratio for all hepatopathies and more severe liver injury was 1.3 (0.7 to 2.3) and 1.9 (1.1 to 3.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: The risk of liver injury in patients taking nimesulide and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is small.",1
2442,10706897,Cigarette smoking and invasive pneumococcal disease. Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Team,"BACKGROUND: Approximately half of otherwise healthy adults with invasive pneumococcal disease are cigarette smokers. We conducted a population-based case-control study to assess the importance of cigarette smoking and other factors as risk factors for pneumococcal infections. METHODS: We identified immunocompetent patients who were 18 to 64 years old and who had invasive pneumococcal disease (as defined by the isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site) by active surveillance of laboratories in metropolitan Atlanta, Baltimore, and Toronto. Telephone interviews were conducted with 228 patients and 301 control subjects who were reached by random-digit dialing. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of the patients and 24 percent of the control subjects were current smokers. Invasive pneumococcal disease was associated with cigarette smoking (odds ratio, 4.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 7.3) and with passive smoking among nonsmokers (odds ratio, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.1) after adjustment by logistic-regression analysis for age, study site, and independent risk factors such as male sex, black race, chronic illness, low level of education, and living with young children who were in day care. There were dose-response relations for the current number of cigarettes smoked per day, pack-years of smoking, and time since quitting. The adjusted population attributable risk was 51 percent for cigarette smoking, 17 percent for passive smoking, and 14 percent for chronic illness. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is the strongest independent risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease among immunocompetent, nonelderly adults. Because of the high prevalence of smoking and the large population attributable risk, programs to reduce both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke have the potential to reduce the incidence of pneumococcal disease.",0
2443,22357577,Clinical course and predictive value of liver function tests in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: an analysis of the EVEREST trial,"AIMS: Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are common in ambulatory heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to characterize abnormal LFTs during index hospitalization. METHODS AND RESULTS: A post-hoc analysis was carried out of the placebo group of the EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) trial, which enrolled patients hospitalized for HF with an ejection fraction (EF) </=40% and no history of primary significant liver disease or acute hepatic failure. LFTs (abbreviation, cut-offs for abnormal values) including serum albumin (ALB, <3.3 g/dL), aspartate transaminase (AST, >34 IU/L), alanine transaminase (ALT, >34 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (AP, >123 IU/L),gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, >50 IU/L), and total bilirubin (T Bili, >1.2 mg/dL) were measured at baseline, discharge/day 7, and post-discharge. Co-primary endpoints were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular mortality or first HF hospitalization (CVM + HFH). Study participants had a mean age of 65.6 +/-12.0 years, were mostly male, reported high prevalences of medical co-morbidities, and were well treated with evidence-based therapies. Baseline LFT abnormalities were common (ALB 17%, AST 21%, ALT 21%, AP 23%, GGT 62%, and T Bili 26%). Abnormal T Bili was the only marker to decrease substantially from baseline (26%) to discharge/day 7 (19%). All LFTs, except AP, improved post-discharge. Lower baseline ALB and elevated T Bili were associated with higher rates of ACM, and in-hospital decreases in ALB and increases in T Bili were associated with higher rates of both ACM and CVM + HFH. CONCLUSION: LFT abnormalities are common during hospitalization for HF in patients with reduced EF and were persistent at discharge. Baseline and in-hospital changes in ALB and T Bili provide additional prognostic value.",1
2444,28930954,Acute procedural interventions after pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: A prospective multicenter evaluation,"Pediatric intra-abdominal injuries (IAI) from blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) rarely require emergent intervention. For those children undergoing procedural intervention, our aim was to understand the timing and indications for operation and angiographic embolization. We prospectively enrolled children younger than 16 years after BAT at 14 Level I Pediatric Trauma Centers over a 1-year period. Patients with IAI who received an intervention (IAI-I) were compared with those who did not receive an intervention using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis; p less than 0.05 was considered significant. Two hundred sixty-one (11.9%) of 2,188 patients had IAI. Forty-five (17.2%) IAI patients received an acute procedural intervention (38 operations, seven angiographic embolization). The mean age for patients requiring intervention was 7.1 ± 4.1 years and not different from the population. Most patients (88.9%) with IAI-I were normotensive. IAI-I patients were significantly more likely to have a mechanism of motor vehicle collision (66.7% vs. 38.9%), more likely to present as a Level I activation (44.4% vs. 26.9%), more likely to have a Glascow Coma Scale less than 14 (31.1% vs. 15.5%), and more likely to have an abnormal abdominal physical examination (93.3% vs. 65.7%) than patients that did not require acute intervention. All patients underwent computed tomography scan before intervention. Operations consisted of laparotomy (n = 21), laparoscopy converted to open (n = 11), and laparoscopy alone (n = 6). The most common surgical indications were hollow viscus injury (HVI) (11 small bowel, 10 colon, 6 small bowel/colon, 2 duodenum). All interventions for solid organ injury, including seven angioembolic procedures, occurred within 8 hours of arrival; many had hypotension and received a transfusion. Procedural interventions were more common for HVI than for solid organ injury (59.2% vs. 7.6%). Postoperative mortality from IAI was 2.6%. Acute procedural interventions for children with IAI from BAT are rare, predominantly for HVI, are performed early in the hospital course and have excellent clinical outcomes.

2445,2057025,Relation between malpractice claims and adverse events due to negligence. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study III,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: By matching the medical records of a random sample of 31,429 patients hospitalized in New York State in 1984 with statewide data on medical-malpractice claims, we identified patients who had filed claims against physicians and hospitals. These results were then compared with our findings, based on a review of the same medical records, regarding the incidence of injuries to patients caused by medical management (adverse events). RESULTS: We identified 47 malpractice claims among 30,195 patients' records located on our initial visits to the hospitals, and 4 claims among 580 additional records located during follow-up visits. The overall rate of claims per discharge (weighted) was 0.13 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.076 to 0.18 percent). Of the 280 patients who had adverse events caused by medical negligence as defined by the study protocol, 8 filed malpractice claims (weighted rate, 1.53 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 3.2 percent). By contrast, our estimate of the statewide ratio of adverse events caused by negligence (27,179) to malpractice claims (3570) is 7.6 to 1. This relative frequency overstates the chances that a negligent adverse event will produce a claim, however, because most of the events for which claims were made in the sample did not meet our definition of adverse events due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS: Medical-malpractice litigation infrequently compensates patients injured by medical negligence and rarely identifies, and holds providers accountable for, substandard care.",0
2446,30747397,Improved Long-term Survival with Remote Limb Ischemic Preconditioning in a Rat Fixed-Pressure Hemorrhagic Shock Model,"We investigated whether bilateral, lower limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) improved long-term survival using a rat model of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation. Rats were anesthetized, intubated and ventilated, and randomly assigned to RIPC, induced by inflating bilateral pressure cuffs around the femoral arteries to 200 mmHg for 5 min, followed by 5-min release of the cuffs (repeated for 4 cycles), or control group (cuffs were inflated to 30 mmHg). Hemorrhagic shock was induced by withdrawing blood to a fixed mean blood pressure of 30 mmHg for 30 min, followed by 30 min of resuscitation with shed blood. Rats remained anesthetized for 1 h during which hemodynamics were monitored then they were allowed to survive for 6 weeks. The percentage of estimated total blood volume withdrawn to maintain a level of 30 mmHg was similar in both groups. RIPC significantly increased survival at 6 weeks: 5 of 27 (19%) rats in the control group and 13 of 26 (50%; p = 0.02) rats in the RIPC group survived. Blood pressure was higher in the RIPC group. The diastolic internal dimension of the left ventricle, an indicator of circulating intravascular blood volume, was significantly larger in the RIPC group at 1 h after initiation of resuscitation compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Left ventricular function assessed by fractional shortening was comparable in both groups at 1 h after initiation of resuscitation. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was within normal range in the RIPC group (17.3 ± 1.2 mg/dl) but elevated in the control group (22.0 ± 1.7 mg/dl) at 48 h after shock. RIPC significantly improved short-term survival in rats that were subjected to hemorrhagic shock, and this benefit was maintained long term. RIPC led to greater circulating intravascular blood volume in the early phase of resuscitation and improved BUN. ",0
2447,19123081,Pleural effusion as the first sign of multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare disorder that affects all tissues, except reticuloendothelial tissues, and seldom causes a myelomatous pleural effusion. A 56-year-old male patient attended our clinic complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue for the past month. A posteroanterior chest radiograph revealed a left pleural effusion, which was subsequently assessed as being exudative in nature. Protein electrophoresis demonstrated hypergammaglobulinemia. Serum and pleural fluid immunofixation electrophoresis showed an increase in the IgG and kappa fractions. The Bence-Jones protein level in the 24-hours urine was high. Pleural biopsy showed plasmocyte infiltration. Bone marrow biopsy revealed atypical plasma cell infiltration, some with immature morphology, carrying IgG/Kappa clonality in a diffuse pattern. The patient was diagnosed with IgG/k type MM and underwent chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone. Complete regression of the pleural effusion was achieved after one round of chemotherapy, and the patient has been followed for 18 months. ",0

2449,10380819,The rationale for early diagnosis of cancer--the example of breast cancer,"The main advantage of early diagnosis of cancer is the reduction of tumor size at initial treatment and thereby an increase in the proportion of patients without distant dissemination. This benefit is illustrated by the example of breast cancer. A model of its natural history was built using data extracted from the files of over 4000 patients followed in the same institution for 20 to 35 years. The model was used to quantify the impact of tumor size, histologic grade, and lymph node involvement on the probability of distant spread. The relationships were found to be highly significant. The model also and unexpectedly revealed that the tumors progress while they grow; avoiding histologic progression is therefore another advantage of early diagnosis. The model showed that residual tumor can be a nidus for distant dissemination, and that consistency between the prediction of the model and the results of post-operative radiotherapy is satisfactory. Conversely to what is often stated, the benefits of post-operative radiotherapy appear to be greater for small tumors, even in the absence of lymph node involvement, than for large ones. The model could be used to help improve screening strategies, but more data are required, in particular for the young age range. ",0
2450,21172265,Long term efficacy and safety of allopurinol and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously reported that IBD patients who are non-responders to thiopurines with preferential shunting of metabolites to hepatotoxic 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides compared to 6-thioguanine nucleotides can reverse the ratio of 6-MMP/6-TGN and respond to thiopurines with the addition of allopurinol. The objective of this study is to report long term efficacy and safety, along with results for an additional 11 patients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients at the University of Chicago IBD Center treated with allopurinol in addition to thiopurines. RESULTS: Twenty five patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were enrolled. Within the first month of therapy 6-TGN metabolite levels increased from a mean of 186.5?17.4 (SE) to 352.8?37.8�pmol/8?10(8) (p=0.0001). Over the same period 6-MMP levels decreased from a mean of 11,966?1697 to 2004?536�pmol/8?10(8) (p<0.0001). The mean daily dosage of prednisone decreased from 19.8?3.8�mg to 5.3?2.7�mg (p=0.03). Thirteen patients have a minimum of one year follow-up. Nine of these thirteen patients have continued on therapy for at least 2�years. All thirteen of these patients continue to be in clinical remission at the last follow-up visit. No patients have had evidence of sustained thrombocytopenia or abnormal liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: In AZA/6-MP non-responders with increased 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios, addition of allopurinol continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for long-term maintenance and steroid-sparing in IBD.",1
2451,18367737,Cervical length at mid-pregnancy and the risk of primary cesarean delivery,"BACKGROUND: Physiological and biochemical studies suggest that normal parturition at term is dependent on programmed development of the uterus in early pregnancy. It is recognized that a short cervix in mid-pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. We hypothesized that a long cervix in mid-pregnancy would be associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery during labor at term. METHODS: We studied 27,472 primiparous women who had a cervical length of 16 mm or more at a median of 23 weeks of gestation and who ultimately delivered a live infant in labor at term. RESULTS: The rate of cesarean delivery at term was lowest (16.0%) among women with a mid-pregnancy cervical length in the lowest quartile (16 to 30 mm) and was significantly greater in the second quartile (18.4%, 31 to 35 mm), third quartile (21.7%, 36 to 39 mm), and fourth quartile (25.7%, 40 to 67 mm) (P<0.001 for trend). The odds ratio for cesarean delivery among women in the fourth quartile, as compared with the first quartile, was 1.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66 to 1.97), and the odds ratio adjusted for maternal age, body-mass index, smoking status, race or ethnic group, gestational age at birth, spontaneous or induced labor, birth-weight percentile, and hospital of delivery was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.53 to 1.84; P<0.001). The increased risk of cesarean delivery was attributable to procedures performed for poor progress in labor. CONCLUSIONS: The cervical length at mid-pregnancy is an independent predictor of the risk of cesarean delivery at term in primiparous women.",0
2452,19092641,Hydralazine-induced cholestatic hepatitis,"Hydralazine has been widely used for treating hypertension, particularly in patients with renal failure. We report a case on a patient in whom we believe the drug was implicated in an otherwise unexplained disturbance of liver function. A 63-year-old African-American female with medical history of hypertension and end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis) was admitted to the hospital with epigastric pain and jaundice. The symptoms started about 1 week ago. Initial laboratory tests showed abnormal liver enzymes with elevated conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggestive of cholestatic jaundice. Amylase and lipase were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal caliber common bile duct without evidence of obstruction. Abdominal CT scan does not show any evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and no mass lesions were seen in the pancreas. Further blood chemistry showed worsening of liver enzymes and increased bilirubin over the next 2-3 days. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography failed to show any evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No other laboratory evidence of cholestatic jaundice was found. Before proceeding for invasive diagnostic procedure, that is, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the patient's drug history was reviewed. She was on hydralazine 75 mg 3 times per day, started 5 months ago. At that time, her liver function tests were normal. As we could not find any other cause of cholestatic jaundice, we attributed this as a side effect of hydralazine. A trial was given by stopping the hydralazine. It was seen that there was significant improvement in the liver function enzymes over the next week. Complete clinical and biochemical recovery occurred over the next 4 weeks. Liver injury after long-term therapy with hydralazine and after short-term therapy with hydralazine (2-10 days) has been described. Hydralazine-induced hepatotoxicity may manifest as hypersensitivity-type injury, mixed hepatocellular injury, acute hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, or centrilobular necrosis. The Hydralazine-induced cholestatic liver injury seems to be fully reversible. Complete clinical and biochemical recovery occurs after discontinuation of the drug. Also, the differential diagnosis of any patient with hepatocellular injury should include medications. This will prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests.",1
2453,23647016,Significant spatial aggregation and fine-scale genetic structure in the homosporous fern Cyrtomium falcatum (Dryopteridaceae),"Spores of homosporous ferns are small, wind-borne and thus have the potential for long-distance dispersal. This common perception has led to a prediction of near-random spatial genetic structure within fern populations. Spore dispersal and spore bank studies, however, indicate that most spores fall close to the maternal plant (< 5 m), supporting a prediction of significant fine-scale genetic structure (FSGS) within populations. To determine which of these two hypotheses is more likely to occur in nature, we measured inbreeding and quantified the spatial distribution of individuals and allozyme-based genotypes using spatial autocorrelation methods within four populations of the fern Cyrtomium falcatum in southern South Korea. Inbreeding levels were low, and all populations exhibited significant aggregation of individuals and strong FSGS. The present results support the second hypothesis, and the substantial FSGS in C. falcatum could reflect the unique features of most homosporous ferns (outcrossing mating systems that lead a majority of spores to occur at short distances and a very limited dispersal distance of male gametes). Although fern spores are physically analogous to orchid seeds, the intensity of FSGS exhibited in C. falcatum is four times stronger than that in 16 terrestrial orchid species. ",0

The aim of this study was to compare LFT elevations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving adalimumab (ADA), etanercept (ETN) or infliximab (INF) enrolled in the Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America from October 2001 to March 2007. METHODS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels >1x upper limit of normal (ULN) were considered elevations and ALT/AST levels >2x ULN were considered abnormalities. Treatments included TNF-Is, methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide and other disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARDs). Patients were censored after their first LFT elevation. Three analytical models were evaluated: (1) individual TNF-I vs non-biological DMARDs (primary model); (2) individual TNF-I plus MTX vs MTX monotherapy; and (3) limited to new users of individual TNF-I vs non-biological DMARDs. ORs for LFT elevations were estimated using generalised estimating equation logistic regression. RESULTS: 6861 patients (ADA: 849; ETN: 1383; INF: 1449) with 22 522 determinations were analysed. LFT elevations >1x ULN with TNF-I use were seen in 5.9% of AST/ALT determinations and abnormalities >2x ULN in 0.77%. In the primary model the adjusted ORs for LFT elevations >1x ULN were ADA 1.35 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.66), ETN 1.00 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.21) and INF 1.58 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.86). For 2x ULN, adjusted ORs were ADA 1.72 (95% CI 0.99 to 3.01), ETN 1.10 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.88) and INF 2.40 (95% CI 1.53 to 3.76). Similar results were obtained in other models. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of LFT elevations >1x ULN with TNF-I use was uncommon and abnormalities >2x ULN were rarely observed. Significant differences were most consistently observed with INF, less commonly with ADA and were not observed with ETN compared with comparator DMARDs.""",1

Among all the compounds synthesized, that obtained from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and 7-chloro-4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan was toxic for bacterial cells, and also able to activated the 1st type Quorum Sensing system. The reaction between 7-chloro-4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan and 2-aminobenzothiazole derivatives gave two products, one bearing the benzofuroxan moiety linked to the exocyclic amino nitrogen, and the second derived from the attack of two molecules of electrophile to both the nitrogen atoms of the benzothiazole reagent. Their relative ratio is modifiable by tuning the reagents ratio and the reaction time.  ",0

2457,30398671,"Estimating Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States, 2013-2016","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in the United States, causing substantial morbidity and mortality and costing billions of dollars annually. To update the estimated HCV prevalence among all adults aged ?18 years in the United States, we analyzed 2013-2016 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate the prevalence of HCV in the noninstitutionalized civilian population and used a combination of literature reviews and population size estimation approaches to estimate the HCV prevalence and population sizes for four additional populations: incarcerated people, unsheltered homeless people, active-duty military personnel, and nursing home residents. We estimated that during 2013-2016 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.0%) of all adults in the United States, approximately 4.1 (3.4-4.9) million persons, were HCV antibody-positive (indicating past or current infection) and that 1.0% (95% CI, 0.8-1.1%) of all adults, approximately 2.4 (2.0-2.8) million persons, were HCV RNA-positive (indicating current infection). This includes 3.7 million noninstitutionalized civilian adults in the United States with HCV antibodies and 2.1 million with HCV RNA and an estimated 0.38 million HCV antibody-positive persons and 0.25 million HCV RNA-positive persons not part of the 2013-2016 NHANES sampling frame. Conclusion: Over 2 million people in the United States had current HCV infection during 2013-2016; compared to past estimates based on similar methodology, HCV antibody prevalence may have increased, while RNA prevalence may have decreased, likely reflecting the combination of the opioid crisis, curative treatment for HCV infection, and mortality among the HCV-infected population; efforts on multiple fronts are needed to combat the evolving HCV epidemic, including increasing capacity for and access to HCV testing, linkage to care, and cure.",0
2458,25570707,Two-dimensional sample entropy analysis of rat sural nerve aging,"Entropy analysis of images are usually performed using Shannon entropy, which calculates the probability of occurrency of each gray level on the image. However, not only the pixel gray level but also the spatial distribution of pixels might be important for image analysis. On the other hand, sample entropy (SampEn) is an important tool for estimation of irregularity in time series, which calculates the probability of pattern occurrence within the series. Therefore, we propose here an extension of SampEn to a two-dimensional case, namely SampEn2D, as an entropy method for extracting features from images that accounts for the spatial distribution of pixels. SampEn2D was applied to histological segments of sural nerve obtained from young (30 days) and elderly (720 days) rats. Morphometric indexes, such as the total number of myelinated fibers and the average myelinated fibers area and perimeter were also calculated. Results show that SampEn2D can extract useful information from histological nerve images, classifying elderly rat image as more regular than young rat. As SampEn2D is related to irregularity/unpredictability, we can conclude that the proposed method is complementary to morphometric indexes. Further studies are being built to validate SampEn2D.  ",0
2459,16526307,"Types of studies, power of study and choice of test]","In scientific research different study designs are used to provide answers to different questions (e.g., What is the cause of a disease? Is medication A better than medication B? What is the prevalence of a disease?). Cross-sectional study is appropriate when we are interested in the prevalence of a disease or certain feature, cohort study provides answer to the incidence or relative risk, whereas case-control study is conducted to obtain odds ratio. While these studies are observational, randomized control trial is the only experimental study design which can give answers to questions of causative relationships between variables as where researcher himself or herself assigns subjects to different groups (experimental or control). Power of a study represents the probability of finding a difference that exists in a population. It depends on the chosen level of significance, difference that we look for (effect size), variability of the measured variables, and sample size. Most often sample size is the only element under direct researcher's control. Therefore, methods have been developed to approximate the necessary sample size to obtain the desired power. Choosing appropriate statistical procedure is a complicated task that demands specific knowledge and training. To determine an appropriate statistical procedure, it is important to keep in mind the following characteristics of the study: (1) purpose of the study (description, investigation of differences or associations); (2) type of sample (dependent or independent samples); (3) number of groups (one, two, or more); (4) level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio); and (5) distribution of the data (normal or not).

2460,25694953,The application of backscattered ultrasound and photoacoustic signals for assessment of bone collagen and mineral contents,"This study examines the backscattered ultrasound (US) and back-propagating photoacoustic (PA) signals from trabecular bones, and their variations with reduction in bone minerals and collagen content. While the collagen status is directly related to the strength of the bone, diagnosis of its condition using US remains a challenge. For both PA and US methods, coded-excitation signals and matched filtering were utilized to provide high sensitivity of the detected signal. The optical source was a 805-nm CW laser and signals were detected employing a 2.2-MHz ultrasonic transducer. Bone decalcification and decollagenization were induced with mild ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium hypochlorite solutions, respectively. The PA and US signals were measured on cattle bones, and apparent integrated backscatter/back-propagating (AIB) parameters were compared before and after demineralization and decollagenization. The results show that both PA and US are sensitive to mineral changes. In addition, PA is also sensitive to changes in the collagen content of the bone, but US is not significantly sensitive to these changes. ",0

Inpatient vancomycin use is increasing and appears to be emerging as an important etiology of DRESS syndrome. This study highlights the importance of vancomycin as a cause of DRESS syndrome. We reviewed all cases of DRESS syndrome among inpatients consulted by the Allergy & Immunology service at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from July 2009 through December 2010. We also reviewed the use of inpatient parenteral vancomycin over the past 4 years at MGH. Six patients fulfilled clinical criteria for DRESS syndrome, including rash, fever, eosinophilia, and hepatitis, with five (83%) having vancomycin as the attributable cause. Onset of symptoms varied from 12 days to 4 weeks after start of vancomycin treatment. Systemic findings included atypical lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, nephritis, hypotension, tachycardia, and pharyngitis. Treatment with corticosteroids was required in three cases. Recurrence of peripheral eosinophilia was a marker of disease relapse. In three of the five patients (60%), elevated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) IgG titers correlated with greater systemic involvement and prolonged time to resolution. MGH pharmacy records indicate a progressive increase in the number of patients treated with parenteral vancomycin over the last 4 years. Causative agents for DRESS syndrome in an inpatient setting is likely different from that seen in the general population. With increasing use of vancomycin, we are likely to see more cases of DRESS syndrome caused by vancomycin. Recognition of vancomycin as a common cause of inpatient DRESS syndrome is important.",1
2462,3574401,Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide as a predictor of gas exchange during exercise,"In patients with pulmonary disease, the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide has been used to predict abnormal gas exchange in the lung. However, abnormal values for arterial blood gases during exercise are likely to be the most sensitive manifestations of lung disease. We compared the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide at rest with measurements of gas exchange during exercise, including arterial oxygen tension, the alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension, the arterial-end-tidal difference in carbon dioxide tension, and the dead-space/tidal-volume ratio in 276 current and former shipyard workers. Sixteen workers had a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide below 70 percent of predicted; one or more measurements of gas exchange during exercise were abnormal in 14. In contrast, of 96 men who had abnormal gas exchange during exercise, only 14 had a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide below 70 percent of predicted. Neither the type nor the degree of abnormality in gas exchange could be predicted from the diffusing capacity. We conclude that diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide at rest is a specific but insensitive predictor of abnormal gas exchange during exercise and that, if indicated, measurements of arterial blood gases should be obtained during exercise.",0

In this open-label, phase 3 study, 135 interferon-ineligible/intolerant and 87 nonresponder patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection were enrolled at 24 centers in Japan. Patients received daclatasvir 60 mg once daily plus asunaprevir 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 24 weeks after treatment (SVR24 ). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01497834). SVR24 was achieved by 87.4% of interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients and 80.5% of nonresponder (null and partial) patients; rates were similar in cirrhosis (90.9%) and noncirrhosis (84.0%) patients, and in patients with IL28B CC (84.5%) or non-CC (84.8%) genotypes. Fourteen patients in each group (12.6%) discontinued dual therapy, mainly due to adverse events or lack of efficacy. Nine nonresponder patients received additional treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin per protocol-defined criteria. The rate of serious adverse events was low (5.9%) and varied among patients. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), headache, diarrhea, and pyrexia. CONCLUSION: Interferon-free, ribavirin-free all-oral therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 24 weeks is well tolerated and can achieve a high rate of SVR in patients with HCV genotype 1b who were ineligible, intolerant, or had not responded to prior interferon-based therapy.

2464,9755246,Neither intestinal sequestration of bile acids nor common bile duct ligation modulate the expression and function of the rat ileal bile acid transporter,"The regulatory responses of bile acid (BA) transport in the terminal ileum to perturbations in BA homeostasis are complex, and conflicting results have been reported by different investigators. These studies were designed to examine the response of this system to a reduction in ileal bile salt concentrations at both a functional and molecular level. Common bile duct ligation (BDL) or feeding of a novel bile acid-binding compound, GT31-104HB, for 7 days were used to reduce ileal apical membrane bile salt flux. Apical bile acid transport function was assessed by examining sodium-dependent uptake of [3H]-taurocholate (TC) into brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and the ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP) were assessed by Western blotting with quantitation using [125I]-labeled secondary antibody and a phosphorimager. Neither common BDL nor intestinal sequestration of BA led to a change in ileal bile acid transport function or the expression of the ASBT or the ILBP. These results indicate that a reduction in presentation of bile salts to the apical surface of the terminal ileum does not modulate the expression of the genes involved in their transport.",0

We investigated an outbreak of abscesses due to MRSA among members of a professional football team and examined the transmission and microbiologic characteristics of the outbreak strain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study and nasal-swab survey of 84 St. Louis Rams football players and staff members. S. aureus recovered from wound, nasal, and environmental cultures was analyzed by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and typing for resistance and toxin genes. MRSA from the team was compared with other community isolates and hospital isolates. RESULTS: During the 2003 football season, eight MRSA infections occurred among 5 of the 58 Rams players (9 percent); all of the infections developed at turf-abrasion sites. MRSA infection was significantly associated with the lineman or linebacker position and a higher body-mass index. No MRSA was found in nasal or environmental samples; however, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was recovered from whirlpools and taping gel and from 35 of the 84 nasal swabs from players and staff members (42 percent). MRSA from a competing football team and from other community clusters and sporadic cases had PFGE patterns that were indistinguishable from those of the Rams' MRSA; all carried the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and the gene complex for staphylococcal-cassette-chromosome mec type IVa resistance (clone USA300-0114). CONCLUSIONS: We describe a highly conserved, community-associated MRSA clone that caused abscesses among professional football players and that was indistinguishable from isolates from various other regions of the United States.",0

It might be related to altered bile acid metabolism, since the rate of cholesterol and phospholipid secreted into bile is thought to be influenced by the hydrophobicity of the bile acid species secreted. We therefore studied the effect of ethinylestradiol on bile acid metabolism and on secretory relationships between taurocholate and cholesterol/phospholipids in bile. Litter-matched Syrian female hamsters (80 to 100 gm body weight) were injected subcutaneously with either 0.2 ml per day corn oil (controls) or a pharmacologic dose of 5 mg per kg per day ethinylestradiol in corn oil (EE-hamsters; n = 6) for 5 days. On Day 6, bile was collected for 60 min (basal secretory rate) via a bile duct fistula after exclusion of the gallbladder. Then, a graded infusion of taurocholate was given for 110 to 130 min. Secretory rates (nmoles.min-1.-1 liver) for bile acids, cholesterol and phospholipids were determined and their mutual """"linkage coefficients"""" (nmoles of secretory increment per 1 nmole of bile acid secreted) calculated by linear regression analysis.

2470,2819333,The influence of amine metabolizing enzymes on the pharmacology of tyramine in the isolated perfused mesenteric arterial bed of the rat,"1. The pressor response to the infusion of tyramine (Tyr) into the isolated perfused mesenteric arterial bed of the rat has been studied at both a low and a high dose (0.2 and 2.0 mumol) and the effect of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibition was examined. Very little MAO-B activity is found in homogenates of this tissue when Tyr is used as substrate. 2. Inhibition of SSAO by treating rats with 1 mg kg-1 (E)-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-fluoroally lamine (MDL 72145) 1 h before dissection, had no significant effect on the maximum pressure attained or the area under the curve (AUC) of the response to both low and high doses of Tyr. Inhibition of MAO-A, by inclusion of 10 microM clorgyline in the perfusing fluid, resulted in no significant potentiation at both low or high doses of Tyr. The inhibition of both these enzymes together substantially increased the AUC of the pressor response. 3. Cocaine (3 microM) significantly potentiated the responses to adrenaline (Ad). At this dose, cocaine significantly reduced the peak height and the AUC of the responses to both doses of Tyr. 4. Inhibition of extraneuronal uptake mechanisms with corticosterone (29 microM) did not potentiate the response to Ad and did not significantly alter the response to Tyr (low dose). 5. The effects of MDL 72145 and clorgyline on the directly acting amine, Ad, were studied. MDL 72145 caused a small but significant increase in the EC50 and in the maximum response to Ad, whilst clorgyline (10 microM) increased the EC50 value slightly and decreased the maximum response.

Acid-base values and electrolyte concentrations were determined in cisternal and lumbar fluid from 12 severely anoxic patients (cardiac arrest), and from 15 within 24 hours after cardiac resuscitation. In the severely anoxia patients the normal cisternal-lumbar pH gradient was reversed, cisternal fluid was more acid (pH 6.815 vs. 6.953), and cisternal potassium concentration was twice that of lumbar (6.7 vs 3.5 mEq per liter). These findings indicate that during anoxia potassium and hydrogen ion flow from brain cells into the brain extracellular fluid, and that acute changes are reflected more accurately by cisternal than by lumbar fluid. In resuscitated patients cisternal fluid was normal, and normal cisternal-lumbar differences were found; thus, the normal milieu of brain cells is rapidly reestablished after resuscitation.",0

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with AF or AFl (n=325) were randomized to 125, 250, or 500 microgram dofetilide or placebo twice daily. Dosages were adjusted for QTc response and, after 105 patients were enrolled, for calculated creatinine clearance (Cl(Cr)). Pharmacological cardioversion rates for 125, 250, and 500 microgram dofetilide were 6.1%, 9.8%, and 29.9%, respectively, versus 1.2% for placebo (250 and 500 microgram versus placebo; P=0.015 and P<0.001, respectively). Seventy percent of pharmacological cardioversions with dofetilide were achieved in 24 hours and 91% in 36 hours. For the 250 patients who successfully cardioverted pharmacologically or electrically, the probability of remaining in SR at 1 year was 0.40, 0.37, 0.58 for 125, 250, and 500 microgram dofetilide, respectively, and 0.25 for placebo (500 microgram versus placebo, P=0.001). Two cases of torsade de pointes occurred, 1 on day 2 and the other on day 3 (0.8% of all patients given active drug); 1 sudden cardiac death, classified as proarrhythmic, occurred on day 8 (0.4% of all patients given active drug). CONCLUSIONS: Dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, is moderately effective in cardioverting AF or AFl to SR and significantly effective in maintaining SR for 1 year. In-hospital initiation and dosage adjustment based on QTc and Cl(Cr) are necessary to minimize a small but nonnegligible proarrhythmic risk.""",1

In preclinical studies, it has demonstrated a broader spectrum of antitumor activity than methotrexate, and appears to have synergistic antitumor activity when combined with a number of other agents. In clinical trials, the primary toxicity has been hematologic, with rapid recovery and no evidence of cumulative dose effect. Nonhematologic toxicity has been sporadic. Preliminary results of phase II trials indicate activity against breast, non-small-cell lung, and head and neck tumors. In addition, trimetrexate with simultaneous leucovorin rescue appears to be a promising new treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients, with minimal toxic side effects.",1
2481,20930099,Hepatitis B reactivation and rituximab in the oncology practice,"Rituximab use in hematology and oncology practice has significantly and positively improved the clinical outcomes in patients with a wide variety of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. However, emerging data reveal that there is a risk of viral hepatitis B reactivation in some patients treated with rituximab. Many of these cases result in treatment delays, inferior oncologic outcomes, increased morbidity, and more rarely fulminant hepatic decompensation and death. Indeed, the rituximab package insert and many clinical practice guidelines have been modified to reflect these concerns. The true incidence and mechanism of reactivation are still being elucidated. This article focuses on the current evidence that supports these recently revised clinical recommendations along with a review of the risk factors for reactivation, suggested monitoring, and preventative interventions.",1
2482,16529526,Ketamine : from medicine to misuse,"""This review describes the medical, research and recreational uses of ketamine, an anaesthetic derivative of phencyclidine that has dissociative, analgesic and psychedelic properties. Ketamine has a complex mechanism of action that is further complicated by stereoselectivity; however, antagonism of glutamate NDMA receptors is thought to underlie its analgesic, dissociative and neuroprotective effects. While ketamine use in medical and veterinary settings is well documented and has a good safety record, the increase in its unregulated use outside of such controlled environments is a cause for concern. The impact on higher centres in the brain, particularly altered perception of auditory, visual and painful stimuli, results in a general lack of responsive awareness that puts the recreational user at (often unrecognised) risk of personal harm. The perceptual and mood changes observed in those who have consumed ketamine are highly sensitive to age, dose, route of administration, previous experience and setting. At low doses, stimulant effects predominate and the effect of environmental conditions are significant; with higher doses, psychedelic effects predominate and the effect of the environment diminishes. The potential of ketamine as a novel clinical and research tool is matched by its abuse potential outside medical settings.""",1

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Tertiary care referral hospital. PATIENTS From July 1, 2007, to January 31, 2011, all patients with colorectal metastases receiving preoperative oxaliplatin- and/or irinotecan-based chemotherapy (?4 cycles) were considered for the present study. Patients underwent parenchymal biopsy before liver resection. Blinded CALI evaluation was performed on biopsy and resection specimens. INTERVENTION Liver resection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of liver biopsy in CALI evaluation. RESULTS We included 100 patients. At specimen analysis, grade 2�or 3 steatosis was diagnosed in 30 patients; grade 2 or 3 sinusoidal dilatation, in 28; grade 2 hepatocellular ballooning, in 3; grade 2 or 3 lobular inflammation, in 25; and steatohepatitis in 19. Obesity was associated with grade 3 steatosis (20.8% vs 5.3%; odds ratio [OR], 4.74 [P�=�.03]) and steatohepatitis (33.3% vs 14.5%; OR, 2.96 [P�=�.04]). Oxaliplatin administration was associated with higher sinusoidal dilatation grade (P�=�.049). Mortality (2 cases) was increased among patients with steatohepatitis (10.5% vs 0; OR, 13.67 [P�=�.04]). Biopsy findings correctly predicted steatosis (sensitivity, 88.9%; accuracy, 93.0%) but had low sensitivity and accuracy for sinusoidal dilatation (21.4% and 63.0%, respectively), hepatocellular ballooning (16.0% and 69.0%, respectively), lobular inflammation (20.0% and 78.0%, respectively), and steatohepatitis (21.1% and 79.0%, respectively). Biopsy accuracy did not improve regarding specific chemotherapy regimens or prolonged treatments. CONCLUSIONS Liver biopsy cannot be considered a reliable tool in assessing CALIs except for steatosis. The procedure should not be recommended during preoperative workup.""",1

The frozen pulp was freeze dried at - 62 °C during 48 h. Papaya pulp with 14% DE maltodextrin was also dried in a spray dryer. The organic acids, sugars, color, total soluble solids, pH, carotenoids, phenolic and flavonoid compounds, and antioxidant capacity values were determined. The changes in color, pH and lycopene were negligible. However, lower retention (86.5%) of vitamin C and sugars (glucose-79.7% and fructose-66.1%) was observed in spray dried products. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were identified and quantified in dried papaya products by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. Spray dried products presented a higher retention of phenolic and flavonoid compounds compared to the freeze dried products. Despite some variations in the parameters studied, the use of freeze- and spray-drying has proven viable options for the drying of papaya pulp. ",0

2487,25703536,Mannitol induces selective astroglial death in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus following status epilepticus,"In the present study, we addressed the question of whether treatment with mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, affects astrogliovascular responses to status epilepticus (SE). In saline-treated animals, astrocytes exhibited reactive astrogliosis in the CA1-3 regions 2-4 days after SE. In the mannitol-treated animals, a large astroglial empty zone was observed in the CA1 region 2 days after SE. This astroglial loss was unrelated to vasogenic edema formation. There was no difference in SE-induced neuronal loss between saline- and mannitol-treated animals. Furthermore, mannitol treatment did not affect astroglial loss and vasogenic edema formation in the dentate gyrus and the piriform cortex. These findings suggest that mannitol treatment induces selective astroglial loss in the CA1 region independent of vasogenic edema formation following SE. These findings support the hypothesis that the susceptibility of astrocytes to SE is most likely due to the distinctive heterogeneity of astrocytes independent of hemodynamics. ",0

Patients were randomized to receive cyclosporin (CSA) alone or the combination of horse antithymocyte globulin ([ATG] Lymphoglobuline; Merieux, Lyon, France) and CSA. The endpoint of the study was the hematologic response at 6 months. One hundred fifteen patients were randomized and assessable with a median follow-up period of 36 months; 61 received CSA and 54 ATG and CSA. In the CSA group, the percentage of complete and partial responders was 23% and 23%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 46%. A significantly higher overall response rate of 74% was found in the ATG and CSA group, with 57% complete and 17% partial responders (P =. 02). Compared with CSA alone, the combination of ATG and CSA resulted in a significantly higher median hemoglobin level and platelet count at 6 months. Fewer patients required a second course of treatment before 6 months due to a nonresponse. In the CSA group, 15 of 61 (25%) patients required a course of ATG before 6 months because of disease progression, compared with only 3 of 54 (6%) in the ATG and CSA group. The survival probabilities for the two groups were comparable, 93% (CSA group) and 91% (ATG and CSA group), but at 180 days, the prevalence of patients surviving free of transfusions, which excluded patients requiring second treatment because of nonresponse, death, disease progression, or relapse, was 67% in the CSA group and 90% in the ATG and CSA group (P =.001). We conclude that the combination of ATG and CSA is superior to CSA alone in terms of the hematologic response, the quality of response, and early mortality, and a second course of immunosuppression is less frequently required.""",1
2490,16506841,Effect of flavor compound chemical structure and environmental relative humidity on the binding of volatile flavor compounds to dehydrated soy protein isolates,"Influence of flavor compound chemical structure, including functional group and stereochemistry, and environmental relative humidity (RH) on the binding of volatile flavor compounds to dehydrated soy protein isolates (SPIs) was evaluated by inverse gas chromatography. Binding of selected volatile flavor compounds differed slightly between SPIs of different origins. Results showed that the flavor compound chemical structure greatly determined its binding potential to SPIs. Binding of nonpolar flavor compounds (hydrocarbon) to soy proteins was attributed mainly to nonspecific van der Waals dispersion forces and was not affected by adsorbed water. The more polar flavor compounds (ester, ketone, aldehyde, and alcohol) exhibited both specific (hydrogen bonding, dipole forces) and nonspecific interactions, and their binding with soy proteins was greatly impaired by adsorbed water in the extremely low humidity region (approaching 0% RH). Further water uptake in the 30 to 50% RH region did not significantly affect the binding of polar compounds, although sorption of alcohol compounds (when present at high levels) further increased.

2491,15334875,Management of thalidomide toxicity,"Thalidomide has re-emerged as a novel antineoplastic agent with immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic activities. In the early sixties, it was withdrawn from the market after its infamous association with congenital abnormalities that left about 10,000 children affected world-wide. With strict regulations and precautions, thalidomide is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum. Its role in cancer therapy is promising, with clinical trials in the past 5 years showing significant activity in multiple myeloma. Several trials are ongoing in other malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. The major toxicities of thalidomide are birth defects, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, somnolence, rash, fatigue, and constipation. Less common side effects include deep venous thrombosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, malaise, and peripheral edema. The incidence and severity of adverse events are related to dose and duration of therapy. Doses of the drug of 200 mg/day or less are usually well tolerated. In this review, we will discuss the incidence and management of the side effects of thalidomide and the precautions and interventions needed to minimize the toxicities of this drug.",1

METHODS: The postmortem findings in deaths associated with the ring substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethyl-amphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA, eve) were studied in seven young white men aged between 20 and 25 years. RESULTS: Striking changes were identified in the liver, which varied from foci of individual cell necrosis to centrilobular necrosis. In one case there was massive hepatic necrosis. Changes consistent with catecholamine induced myocardial damage were seen in five cases. In the brain perivascular haemorrhagic and hypoxic changes were identified in four cases. Overall, the changes in four cases were the same as those reported in heart stroke, although only two cases had a documented history of hyperthermia. Of these four cases, all had changes in their liver, three had changes in their brains, and three in their heart. Of the other three cases, one man died of fulminant liver failure, one of water intoxication and one probably from a cardiac arrhythmia associated with myocardial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there is more than one mechanism of damage in ring substituted amphetamine misuse, injury being caused by hyperthermia in some cases, but with ring substituted amphetamines also possibly having a toxic effect on the liver and other organs in the absence of hyperthermia.",1

2494,30207912,Essential Role of BRCA2 in Ovarian Development and Function,"The causes of ovarian dysgenesis remain incompletely understood. Two sisters with XX ovarian dysgenesis carried compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene that led to reduced BRCA2 protein levels and an impaired response to DNA damage, which resulted in chromosomal breakage and the failure of RAD51 to be recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks. The sisters also had microcephaly, and one sister was in long-term remission from leukemia, which had been diagnosed when she was 5 years old. Drosophila mutants that were null for an orthologue of BRCA2 were sterile, and gonadal dysgenesis was present in both sexes. These results revealed a new role for BRCA2 and highlight the importance to ovarian development of genes that are critical for recombination during meiosis.

2495,8332153,Preventive care for women. Does the sex of the physician matter?,"BACKGROUND: Emphasis on ensuring women's access to preventive health services has increased over the past decade. Relatively little attention has been paid to whether the sex of the physician affects the rates of cancer screening among women. We examined differences between male and female physicians in the frequency of screening mammograms and Pap smears among women patients enrolled in a large Midwestern health plan. METHODS: We identified claims for mammography and Pap tests submitted by primary care physicians for 97,962 women, 18 to 75 years of age, who were enrolled in the health plan in 1990. The sex of the physician was manually coded, and the physician's age was obtained from the state licensing board. After identifying a principal physician for each woman, we calculated the frequency of mammography and Pap smears for each physician, using the number of women in his or her practice during 1990 as the denominator. Using unconditional logistic regression, we also calculated the odds ratio of having a Pap smear or mammogram for women patients with female physicians as compared with those with male physicians, controlling for the physician's and the patient's age. RESULTS: Crude rates for Pap smears and mammography were higher for the patients of female than male physicians in most age groups of physicians. The largest differences between female and male physicians were in the rates of Pap smears among the youngest physicians. For the subgroup of women enrolled in the health plan for a year who saw only one physician, after adjustment for the patient's age and the physician's age and specialty, the odds ratio for having a Pap smear was 1.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.30) for the patients of female physicians as compared with those of male physicians. For women 40 years old and older, the odds ratio for having a mammogram was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.63). For both Pap smears and mammography, the differences between female and male physicians in screening rates were much more pronounced in internal medicine and family practice than in obstetrics and gynecology. CONCLUSIONS: Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.",0

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized multicenter double-blind parallel-group study, 356 type 2 diabetic subjects with similar mean baseline characteristics (age 54 years, diabetes duration 4.9 years, BMI 32.1 kg/m(2), A1C 8.0%) received subcutaneous placebo or albiglutide (weekly [4, 15, or 30 mg], biweekly [15, 30, or 50 mg], or monthly [50 or 100 mg]) or exenatide twice daily as an open-label active reference (per labeling in metformin subjects only) over 16 weeks followed by an 11-week washout period. The main outcome measure was change from baseline A1C of albiglutide groups versus placebo at week 16. RESULTS: Dose-dependent reductions in A1C were observed within all albiglutide schedules. Mean A1C was similarly reduced from baseline by albiglutide 30 mg weekly, 50 mg biweekly (every 2 weeks), and 100 mg monthly (-0.87, -0.79, and -0.87%, respectively) versus placebo (-0.17%, P < 0.004) and exenatide (-0.54%). Weight loss (-1.1 to -1.7 kg) was observed with these three albiglutide doses with no significant between-group effects. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects receiving albiglutide 30 mg weekly was less than that observed for the highest biweekly and monthly doses of albiglutide or exenatide. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly albiglutide administration significantly improved glycemic control and elicited weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.",1

2499,980094,Detection of intrapulmonary hemorrhage with carbon monoxide uptake. Application in goodpasture's syndrome,"We devised a noninvasive measure of pulmonary hemorrhage of value in the management of Goodpasture's syndrome. We reasoned that alveolar uptake of inhaled carbon monoxide during breath holding would increase in the presence of extravascular blood, but clearance of its radioisotope (C15O) from a lung field would be delayed. Thus, the ratio of uptake to clearance would indicate lung hemorrhage. In 15 controls and six patients with renal failure without hemorrhage, this ratio ranged from 0.73 to 1.5. In eight patients with Goodpasture's syndrome the ratio ranged from 1.5 to 16.5, returning to normal between episodes of bleeding. Measurements of carbon monoxide uptake alone in 10 patients with Goodpasture's syndrome were at times well above that predicted for their hemoglobin level, whereas in renal failure with acute pulmonary edema increased carbon monoxide uptake was rarely found. Thus, monitoring of the single-breath carbon monoxide uptake alone can detect episodes of lung hemorrhage.",0
2500,12395328,Quantitative evaluation of altered hepatic spaces and membrane transport in fibrotic rat liver,"Four animal models were used to quantitatively evaluate hepatic alterations in this study: (1) a carbon tetrachloride control group (phenobarbital treatment only), (2) a CCl(4)-treated group (phenobarbital with CCl(4) treatment), (3) an alcohol-treated group (liquid diet with alcohol treatment), and (4) a pair-fed alcohol control group (liquid diet only). At the end of induction, single-pass perfused livers were used to conduct multiple indicator dilution (MID) studies. Hepatic spaces (vascular space, extravascular albumin space, extravascular sucrose space, and cellular distribution volume) and water hepatocyte permeability/surface area product were estimated from nonlinear regression of outflow concentration versus time profile data. The hepatic extraction ratio of (3)H-taurocholate was determined by the nonparametric moments method. Livers were then dissected for histopathologic analyses (e.g., fibrosis index, number of fenestrae). In these 4 models, CCl(4)-treated rats were found to have the smallest vascular space, extravascular albumin space, (3)H-taurocholate extraction, and water hepatocyte permeability/surface area product but the largest extravascular sucrose space and cellular distribution volume. In addition, a linear relationship was found to exist between histopathologic analyses (fibrosis index or number of fenestrae) and hepatic spaces. The hepatic extraction ratio of (3)H-taurocholate and water hepatocyte permeability/surface area product also correlated to the severity of fibrosis as defined by the fibrosis index. In conclusion, the multiple indicator dilution data obtained from the in situ perfused rat liver can be directly related to histopathologic analyses.",0

METHODS: We studied 38 liver biopsies from patients treated with 6-TG, almost all of whom (n = 125) received 6-TG for 1 to 3 years at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All biopsies were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and prepared in the usual manner. Hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome (trichrome), and reticulin silver impregnation (reticulin) stained slides were studied. In 23 cases, tissue was also prospectively fixed in glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy. RESULTS: In 20 of the 37 patients studied (53%), nodular regeneration of varying degree was seen with reticulin. In only 4 of these 20 instances (11% of the total) were the changes seen with hematoxylin and eosin and in 3 of the 4, only in retrospect after studying the reticulin preparation. Minimal fibrosis was seen with trichrome in only 13 biopsies (34%), but sinusoidal collagen deposition was observed in 14 of the 23 cases studied with electron microscopy (60%). The biopsy from the 1 patient with nodular hyperplasia obvious with hematoxylin and eosin also demonstrated changes of venous outflow obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: 6-TG-treated IBD patients are at significant risk for nodular hyperplasia, early fibrosis and, less often, venous outflow disease (Budd-Chiari). The natural history of these changes is unknown and follow-up biopsies are needed to determine histologic and clinical sequela. Patients not demonstrating nodular hyperplasia or fibrosis who continue with 6-TG because there are no better therapeutic choices should be periodically rebiopsied.",1

However, triangulation is difficult in reduced-port laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and instrument crowding, and collision may occur, so this approach has not been widely used. Recently, an innovative technique for distal pancreatectomy using a robotic single-site surgical system was introduced. Herein, we evaluate the safety and feasibility of this technique. Twenty-seven patients with a pancreatic tail mass underwent robotic single-site plus one-port distal pancreatectomy at six centers. We collected clinicopathologic data and evaluated the short-term perioperative outcomes of robotic single-site plus one-port distal pancreatectomy. We evaluated 26 patients who underwent robotic single-site plus one-port distal pancreatectomy excluding one patient who needed more ports because of fatty abdomen. The mean age and body mass index were 47.3 years (range 21-74) and 22.6 kg/m Robotic single-site plus one-port distal pancreatectomy is safe and feasible in terms of short-term outcomes. This technique could be performed in select cases to expand the surgical boundaries of the robotic single-site platform. Further studies are needed with more cases to investigate long-term outcomes.

Our objective was to review our experience in treating patients with new oral antiviral agents and to assess common factors associated with MCN persistence despite SVR. METHODS: We analyzed a case series of five patients with genotype one chronic HCV complicated by MCN who had persistence of cryoglobulins despite completion of triple therapy with oral antiviral agents (boceprivir, telaprivir or sofosbuvir). RESULTS: Patients with cirrhosis appear to have a decreased ability to clear immune complexes. We observed that early viral response by week 8 of therapy and longer periods of undetectable virus on treatment correlated with eventual clearance of serum cryoglobulins in patients without cirrhosis. Two patients were treated with anti-B-cell agent rituximab prior to starting therapy for HCV; this did not lead to a more effective clearance of cryoglobulins. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a longer treatment course than the standard 24 weeks with triple therapy could aid in the clearance of these immune complexes and cryoglobulins in cirrhotics. More studies to determine the ideal duration of treatment for chronic HCV and coincident MCN are needed, especially in light of the new all oral direct-acting antiviral regimens that are now recommended for HCV treatment.""",1
2508,19584748,The effects of transcranial stimulation on paretic lower limb motor excitability during walking,"Balanced transcallosal inhibition sustains symmetrical corticomotor excitability and assists the performance of bimanual voluntary movements. After stroke, transcallosal inhibition becomes asymmetric. This finding raised the notion that reducing poststroke asymmetry in transcallosal inhibition might prime the motor system before training and lead to improvements in walking recovery. In this study, we examined three neuromodulatory protocols applied during walking to determine if they could increase ipsilesional and decrease contralesional motor excitability in patients with chronic stroke. Inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and inhibitory paired associative stimulation were applied to the contralesional motor system, and facilitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation was applied to the ipsilesional motor system. We tested the bilateral modulatory effects of each stimulation protocol on the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, medial hamstrings, and vastus lateralis of nine patients with chronic stroke. All stimulation protocols increased paretic limb and decreased nonparetic limb motor excitability. There was no statistical difference in the extent of modulation between these stimulation protocols. This result suggests these three protocols are promising candidate priming mechanisms for testing the hypothesis in a future study that reducing the poststroke asymmetry of between-hemisphere motor excitability will enhance the effect of gait therapy.

2509,29895279,Relationship between the geometry patterns of vertebrobasilar artery and atherosclerosis,"The plaques at the dorsal or lateral wall of basilar artery (BA) are associated with pontine infarcts. We sought to explore the correlations between vertebrobasilar artery geometry and BA plaque locations. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging and clinical data of 84 patients with BA atherosclerosis. On three-dimensional time-of-flight images, a side to side diameter difference of bilateral vertebral artery (VA) and BA bending were assessed. The vertebrobasilar artery geometry was qualitatively classified into four basic configurations: Walking, Tuning Fork, Dominant-Lambda, and Hypoplasia-Lambda. On high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, the plaques were categorized based on the involvement of the ventral, dorsal, or lateral sides of BA wall. The relationships between vertebrobasilar artery geometry parameters and plaque locations were analyzed. Left VA dominance was identified in 28(33%) patients, and right VA dominance in 22(26%) patients. BA bending were detected in 49 patients. There were no significant correlations between the diameter difference/ratio of VA diameters and plaque locations, or between BA bending and plaque locations. BA plaques were evenly distributed in the vertebrobasilar arteries with Tuning Fork and Dominant-Lambda configurations. In Hypoplasia-Lambda group, however, plaques were more frequently located at the dorsal wall (58.57%) than at the ventral (14.43%) and lateral wall (26.71%; P = 0.001). In Walking group, the plaques more likely occurred at the lateral (49.79%) and dorsal (35.07%) wall than at the ventral wall (14.86%, P = 0.02). The geometric configurations of vertebrobasilar artery strongly influence the BA plaque locations. Further prospective studies are warranted to testify whether Hypoplasia-Lambda and Walking configurations are independent risk factors for pontine infarcts. ",0
2510,26034120,Rising trend in vitamin D status from 1993 to 2013: dual concerns for the future,"""BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine 2011 Report on Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D specified higher intakes for all age groups compared to the 1997 report, but also cautioned against spurious claims about an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and against advocates of higher intake requirements. Over 40 years, we have noted marked improvement in vitamin D status but we are concerned about hypervitaminosis D. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) trend over 20 years. DESIGN: We retrieved all results of serum 25OHD from 1993 to 2013 (n=69 012) that was trimmed to one sample per person (n=43 782). We conducted a time series analysis of the monthly averages for 25OHD using a simple sequence chart and a running median smoothing function. We modelled the data using univariate auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and forecast 25OHD levels up to 2016. RESULTS: The time series sequence chart and smoother function demonstrated a steady upward trend with seasonality. The yearly average 25OHD increased from 36.1 nmol/l in 1993 to 57.3 nmol/l in 2013. The ARIMA model was a good fit for the 25OHD time series; it forecasted monthly average 25OHD up to the end of 2016 with a positive stationary R(2) of 0.377. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D status improved over the past 40 years, but there remains a dual problem: there are groups at risk of vitamin D deficiency who need public health preventative measures; on the other hand, random members of the population are taking unnecessarily high vitamin D intakes for unsubstantiated claims.""",1
2511,12912743,High prevalence of potentially hepatotoxic herbal supplement use in patients with fulminant hepatic failure,"""HYPOTHESIS: The use of potentially hepatotoxic herbal and dietary supplements is highly prevalent in the fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) patient population at our institution, and this subgroup of patients has a worse prognosis. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. Settings An adult tertiary care university hospital and a Veterans Affairs hospital in Oregon. PATIENTS: All patients referred to the liver transplantation service for FHF from January 2001 through October 2002 (N = 20). We defined FHF as onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset of jaundice in the absence of preexisting liver disease. All patients underwent investigation for potential causes of liver injury. Potentially hepatotoxic supplements were defined as those with previously published reports of hepatic injury related to their use. RESULTS: Ten patients (50%) were recent or active users of potentially hepatotoxic supplements or herbs; 10 had no history of supplement use. In the supplement group, 7 patients (35%) had no other identified cause for hepatic failure. Six patients in the supplement group and 2 patients in the nonsupplement group underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Five patients in each group died. There were no significant differences in transplantation rate (P =.07) or survival (P>.99) between groups. Supplement use alone accounted for the most cases of FHF during this period, exceeding acetaminophen toxicity and viral hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal and dietary supplements were potential hepatotoxins in a high proportion of patients with FHF at our institution. Enhanced public awareness of the potential hepatotoxicity of these commonly used agents and increased regulatory oversight of their use is strongly urged.""",1
2512,17916050,Daclizumab,"Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to the IL-2 receptor on activated lymphocytes and blocks the production of IL-2. Its use is well established in solid organ transplantation as induction therapy, especially in high-risk patients where reduction or delayed dose of standard immunosuppression would be beneficial. It has been used effectively in both 2-dose and 5-dose regimens in conjunction with other standard immunosuppressive agents. The incidence of acute rejection appears reduced without increasing the rates of infection or post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders. The agent is generally well tolerated in adults and children and there is no need for additional monitoring. Daclizumab has also been used outside the transplant arena in a variety of immune-mediated diseases with limited success.",1

2516,24090944,Liver abnormalities in drug and substance abusers,"Drug and substance abuse remains a major medical problem. Alcohol use, abuse and dependence are highly prevalent conditions. Alcohol related liver disease can present as simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. Paracetamol hepatotoxicity secondary to accidental or deliberate overdose is another common problem. While the adverse cardiovascular, neurological, renal and psychiatric consequences of various illicit substance abuses are widely studied and publicized, less attention has been directed towards possible hepatotoxic effects. Illicit drug abuse can cause a range of liver abnormalities ranging from asymptomatic derangement of liver function tests to fulminant hepatic failure. This article reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, investigations, management and prognostic factors of alcohol related liver disease and paracetamol hepatotoxicity as well as the current knowledge pertaining to hepatotoxicity of the more commonly used illicit substances including cannabis, amphetamine type stimulants, cocaine, khat chewing and complementary and alternate medicine.",1
2517,30485780,Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder and Month of School Enrollment,"BACKGROUND: Younger children in a school grade cohort may be more likely to receive a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than their older peers because of age-based variation in behavior that may be attributed to ADHD rather than to the younger age of the children. Most U.S. states have arbitrary age cutoffs for entry into public school. Therefore, within the same grade, children with birthdays close to the cutoff date can differ in age by nearly 1 year. METHODS: We used data from 2007 through 2015 from a large insurance database to compare the rate of ADHD diagnosis among children born in August with that among children born in September in states with and states without the requirement that children be 5 years old by September 1 for enrollment in kindergarten. ADHD diagnosis was determined on the basis of diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. We also used prescription records to compare ADHD treatment between children born in August and children born in September in states with and states without the cutoff date of September 1. RESULTS: The study population included 407,846 children in all U.S. states who were born in the period from 2007 through 2009 and were followed through December 2015. The rate of claims-based ADHD diagnosis among children in states with a September 1 cutoff was 85.1 per 10,000 children (309 cases among 36,319 children; 95% confidence interval [CI], 75.6 to 94.2) among those born in August and 63.6 per 10,000 children (225 cases among 35,353 children; 95% CI, 55.4 to 71.9) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 21.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 8.8 to 34.0); the corresponding difference in states without the September 1 cutoff was 8.9 per 10,000 children (95% CI, -14.9 to 20.8). The rate of ADHD treatment was 52.9 per 10,000 children (192 of 36,319 children; 95% CI, 45.4 to 60.3) among those born in August and 40.4 per 10,000 children (143 of 35,353 children; 95% CI, 33.8 to 47.1) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 12.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 2.43 to 22.4). These differences were not observed for other month-to-month comparisons, nor were they observed in states with non-September cutoff dates for starting kindergarten. In addition, in states with a September 1 cutoff, no significant differences between August-born and September-born children were observed in rates of asthma, diabetes, or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are higher among children born in August than among children born in September in states with a September 1 cutoff for kindergarten entry.

2518,2823722,The changes in serum neuron-specific enolase in patients with small cell lung cancer],"Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was measured in 48 newly diagnosed untreated patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) by radioimmunoassay. Serum NSE level elevated (greater than or equal to 15 ng/ml) in 50% of all patients. The positive ratio of NSE in patients with extensive disease (64%) was significantly higher than those in the patients with limited disease (30%) (p less than 0.05). The positive ratio of NSE in the patients with one metastatic site was 50%, that with two or more metastatic sites was 100% (p less than 0.05). No significant correlation was found between serum NSE levels and metastatic site as well as between serum NSE levels and response to the chemotherapy. In the patients with extensive disease, survival time was shorter in the patients with positive NSE levels than the patients with normal NSE levels. These findings indicate that serum NSE may be a useful marker for staging, monitoring and prognosis in patients with SCLC. ",0

We previously reported on the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in 155 AML patients treated within the Austrian Azacitidine Registry (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01595295). We herein update this report with a population almost twice as large (n?=?302). This cohort included 172 patients with >30 % BM blasts; 93 % would have been excluded from the pivotal AZA-001 trial (which led to European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of azacitidine for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML with 20-30 % BM blasts). Despite this much more unfavorable profile, results are encouraging: overall response rate was 48 % in the total cohort and 72 % in patients evaluable according to MDS-IWG-2006 response criteria, respectively. Median OS was 9.6 (95 % CI 8.53-10.7)?months. A clinically relevant OS benefit was observed with any form of disease stabilization (marrow stable disease (8.1 months), hematologic improvement (HI) (9.7 months), or the combination thereof (18.9 months)), as compared to patients without response and/or without disease stabilization (3.2 months). Age, white blood cell count, and BM blast count at start of therapy did not influence OS. The baseline factors LDH >225 U/l, ECOG ?2, comorbidities ?3, monosomal karyotype, and prior disease-modifying drugs, as well as the response-related factors hematologic improvement and further deepening of response after first response, were significant independent predictors of OS in multivariate analysis. Azacitidine seems effective in WHO-AML, including patients with >30 % BM blasts (currently off-label use). Although currently not regarded as standard form of response assessment in AML, disease stabilization and/or HI should be considered sufficient response to continue treatment with azacitidine.""",1
2520,25163856,The impact of injecting networks on hepatitis C transmission and treatment in people who inject drugs,"""With the development of new highly efficacious direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV), the concept of treatment as prevention is gaining credence. To date, the majority of mathematical models assume perfect mixing, with injectors having equal contact with all other injectors. This article explores how using a networks-based approach to treat people who inject drugs (PWID) with DAAs affects HCV prevalence. Using observational data, we parameterized an exponential random graph model containing 524 nodes. We simulated transmission of HCV through this network using a discrete time, stochastic transmission model. The effect of five treatment strategies on the prevalence of HCV was investigated; two of these strategies were (1) treat randomly selected nodes and (2) """"treat your friends,"""" where an individual is chosen at random for treatment and all their infected neighbors are treated. As treatment coverage increases, HCV prevalence at 10 years reduces for both the high- and low-efficacy treatment. Within each set of parameters, the treat your friends strategy performed better than the random strategy being most marked for higher-efficacy treatment. For example, over 10 years of treating 25 per 1,000 PWID, the prevalence drops from 50% to 40% for the random strategy and to 33% for the treat your friends strategy (6.5% difference; 95% confidence interval: 5.1-8.1). CONCLUSION: Treat your friends is a feasible means of utilizing network strategies to improve treatment efficiency. In an era of highly efficacious and highly tolerable treatment, such an approach will benefit not just the individual, but also the community more broadly by reducing the prevalence of HCV among PWID.""",0

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of elvitegravir with raltegravir, another HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, in patients in whom previous antiretroviral treatment failed. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 study at 234 sites in 13 countries. Eligible patients had plasma HIV RNA of 1000 copies per mL or greater, any CD4 cell count, and resistance to or 6 months' experience with at least two classes of antiretroviral drugs. They received an open-label background regimen of a fully active, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and a second agent. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) by computer with a block size of four to receive either elvitegravir 150 mg once daily (n=361; 85 mg dose if given with atazanavir, or lopinavir with ritonavir) or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=363). Placebo tablets were given to mask the difference in daily dosing. The primary endpoint was achievement and maintenance of virological response (HIV RNA <50 copies per mL) through week 48. Non-inferiority was prespecified with a margin of 10%. We did a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00708162. FINDINGS: Ten patients allocated elvitegravir and 12 assigned raltegravir were excluded from the analysis (either for protocol violations or because they did not receive treatment). 207 (59%) of 351 patients allocated elvitegravir achieved virological response compared with 203 (58%) of 351 assigned raltegravir (treatment difference 1?1%, 95% CI -6?0 to 8?2), meeting the criterion for non-inferiority (p=0?001). Three patients allocated elvitegravir had serious adverse events related to study drugs compared with seven assigned raltegravir; two and eight patients died, respectively. More individuals assigned elvitegravir reported diarrhoea up to week 48 (p=0?023), and more patients assigned raltegravir had grade 3 or 4 rises in alanine aminotransferase (p=0?020) or aspartate aminotransferase (p=0?009). INTERPRETATION: Elvitegravir used in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in treatment-experienced patients has similar efficacy and safety to raltegravir. Since elvitegravir can be given once a day compared with twice a day for raltegravir, elvitegravir might improve patients' adherence. FUNDING: Gilead Sciences.""",1
2522,18320028,Peripherally-derived BDNF promotes regeneration of ascending sensory neurons after spinal cord injury,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) and truncated trkB receptor on astrocytes prevent the penetration of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) applied into the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) thus restrict its application in the treatment of nervous diseases. As BDNF is anterogradely transported by axons, we propose that peripherally derived and/or applied BDNF may act on the regeneration of central axons of ascending sensory neurons. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis by using conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve as a model to increase the expression of endogenous BDNF in sensory neurons and by injecting exogenous BDNF into the peripheral nerve or tissues. Here we showed that most of regenerating sensory neurons expressed BDNF and p-CREB but not p75NTR. Conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of ascending sensory neuron and the increase in the number of p-Erk positive and GAP-43 positive neurons was blocked by the injection of the BDNF antiserum in the periphery. Enhanced neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro by conditioning lesion was also inhibited by the neutralization with the BDNF antiserum. The delivery of exogenous BDNF into the sciatic nerve or the footpad significantly increased the number of regenerating DRG neurons and regenerating sensory axons in the injured spinal cord. In a contusion injury model, an injection of BDNF into the footpad promoted recovery of motor functions. Our data suggest that endogenous BDNF in DRG and spinal cord is required for the enhanced regeneration of ascending sensory neurons after conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve and peripherally applied BDNF may have therapeutic effects on the spinal cord injury.

2523,30769762,"First Report of Rubus yellow net virus on Rubus idaeus in Alberta, Canada","In North America, Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV), a member of the genus Badnavirus, family Caulimoviridae, is vectored in a semipersistent manner by the large raspberry aphid (Amphorophora agathonica Hottes) and is responsible for producing net-like chlorosis of tissue along the leaf veins (2). Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is commonly grown in Canada and after the dry, hot summer of 2006 in southern Alberta, a group of garden raspberry plants located near Lethbridge, Alberta exhibited interveinal chlorosis resembling viral symptoms. Nonenveloped, 140 × 30 nm, bacilliform particles typical of badnaviruses were observed in infected leaves by transmission electron microscopy. The presence of RYNV was confirmed by immunocapture of virions from extracts of symptomatic leaves using Sugarcane bacilliform virus polycolonal antiserum (Agdia Incorporated, Elkhart, IN) followed by PCR amplification of a 451-bp fragment with RYNV-specific primers based on the highly conserved region of the reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H genes (5'-ATCCTCAAAGGGTTACGTAGCTGGTT-3' and 5'-TTCAAGCCACCTTACCCTCGAAGGTTT-3'). Sequence of clones from the PCR product (GenBank Accession No. EU327346) showed 87% identity to a previously sequenced isolate of RYNV (GenBank Accession No. AF468454) (1).

Mononuclear cells from 10 of 11 patients did not generate an effective lymphokine in response to mitogen, and 11 of 16 produced subnormal levels of gamma interferon (less than 300 U per milliliter). In addition, upon stimulation with specific microbial antigen, cells from none of 14 patients generated active lymphokines, and cells from 13 to 14 completely failed to secrete gamma interferon. However, the antimicrobial function of monocytes from the patients was intact, and once stimulated with normal lymphokines or gamma interferon alone, macrophages derived from patients' monocytes responded with enhanced and effective intracellular antimicrobial activity. These results suggest that impaired lymphokine production may predispose patients with AIDS to opportunistic infections, and they provide a rationale for using gamma interferon as immunotherapy.",0

2529,11826398,Insulin signaling in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of CYP2E1 expression,"Diabetes has been reported to increase the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein several-fold, and enhanced expression has been associated with elevated ketone bodies. Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were used to explore ketone body and insulin regulation of CYP2E1 expression. Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (AC), alone or in combination, either failed to affect or decreased CYP2E1 mRNA levels by up to 90% relative to untreated hepatocytes. Insulin produced a concentration-dependent decrease in CYP2E1 mRNA levels, and insulin receptor immunoprecipitation showed a correspondence between receptor phosphorylation and the decrease in CYP2E1 mRNA levels at physiologic levels of insulin. Phosphatase inhibitors decreased CYP2E1 mRNA levels by greater than 95%. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 and rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, ameliorated the insulin-mediated decrease in CYP2E1 mRNA levels. Geldanamycin, which inhibits Src kinase, also abrogated the insulin-mediated decrease in CYP2E1 mRNA levels. In contrast, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB202190 did not affect the insulin-mediated decrease in CYP2E1. CYP2E1 mRNA half-life decreased from approximately 48 hours in the absence of insulin to approximately 15 hours at 10 nmol/L insulin, and this decrease was prevented by wortmannin. The half-life of CYP2B mRNA was increased by insulin, whereas that of CYP3A was unaffected. Analysis of CYP2E1 gene transcription using heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) showed that insulin suppressed CYP2E1 transcription. In conclusion, these data show involvement of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in the insulin-mediated regulation of CYP2E1 and implicate PI3-kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and Src kinase in mediating these effects.",0

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Three patients, all who had HCV cirrhosis with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and had started taking ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir within the preceding 2 weeks, presented with similar nonspecific symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, and nausea. All had elevated lactate levels at admission without evidence of hypovolemia, cardiogenic failure, or vasodilatory shock. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were given appropriate supportive intensive care for what was initially suspected to be sepsis, including a minimum of 30 mL/kg of IV fluids, infectious workup including blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and mechanical ventilatory support. The first patient received continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. The second patient received hemodialysis. The third patient was initially started on hemodialysis despite high norepinephrine requirements and ultimately transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The first patient died despite maximal intensive care. The second patient improved immediately upon starting hemodialysis and was extubated within 48 hours and discharged home. The third patient eventually became hypotensive and was treated with repeated sessions of renal replacement therapy. He ultimately was extubated and discharged home. The infectious workup was negative for all three patients, and antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days in the second and third patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir may cause type B lactic acidosis. Further study is warranted to identify risk factors and elucidate the mechanisms of excessive lactate production.",1

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study recruiting all patients who started BRV between February and November 2016 with observation time between 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Of a total of 262 patients (mean age 40, range 5-81 years, 129 male) treated with BRV, 227 (87%) were diagnosed to have focal, 19 (7%) idiopathic generalized and 8 (3%) symptomatic generalized epilepsy, whereas 8 (3%) were unclassified. The length of exposure to BRV ranged from 1 day to 12 months, with a median retention time of 6.1 months, resulting in a total exposure time to BRV of 1,504 months. The retention rate was 79.4% at 3 months and 75.8% at 6 months. Efficacy at 3 months was 41.2% (50% responder rate) with 14.9% seizure-free for 3 months and, at 6 months, 40.5% with 15.3% seizure-free. Treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 37.8% of the patients, with the most common being somnolence, dizziness, and behavioral adverse events (BAEs). BAE that presented under previous levetiracetam (LEV) treatment improved upon switch to BRV in 57.1% (20/35) and LEV-induced somnolence improved in 70.8% (17/24). Patients with BAE on LEV were more likely to develop BAE on BRV (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-7.95). SIGNIFICANCE: BRV in broad clinical postmarketing use is a well-tolerated anticonvulsant drug with 50% responder rates, similar to those observed in the regulatory trials, even though 90% of the patients included had previously been exposed to LEV. An immediate switch from LEV to BRV at a ratio of 10:1 to 15:1 is feasible. The only independent significant predictor of efficacy was the start of BRV in patients not currently taking LEV. The occurrence of BAE during previous LEV exposure predicted poor psychobehavioral tolerability of BRV treatment. A switch to BRV can be considered in patients with LEV-induced BAE.",1
2534,18395842,Lymphoid neogenesis and immune infiltration in aged liver,"Immune dysregulation and inflammation play a major role in the pathology of age-related disorders. In an earlier study, the microarray data from our laboratory indicated an increase in inflammation-related gene expression in the liver with age. We further investigated immune-related changes in the aged liver and found that the levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory genes were higher in aged animals. Immunohistochemical studies showed that immune cells formed clusters or foci in the livers of old mice, preferentially near the perivascular regions. Further analysis revealed an enrichment of macrophages, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils in old liver. Characterization of the immune clusters showed the presence of shared markers of tertiary lymphoid neogenesis. Levels of lymph node homing cytokines were elevated. Expression of immunoglobulin and recombinase gene transcripts was also higher, indicating the presence of ectopic lymphoid structures in the aged liver. CONCLUSION: Aged liver exhibits a marked inflammatory status accompanied by increased immune cell infiltration. Inflammation and ectopic lymphoid structures have previously been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis, a condition that becomes more prevalent with age. Thus, further study of inflammation-related changes in the microenvironment of the aged liver could provide insights into these disorders.",0
2535,12141828,Severe cholestatic hepatitis caused by thiazolidinediones: risks associated with substituting rosiglitazone for troglitazone,"Troglitazone maleate (Rezulin) has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity, which led to its withdrawal from the U.S. market in March 2000. Rosiglitazone maleate (Avandia) is being marketed as a safe alternative in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We report a case of severe thiazolidinedione-induced cholestatic hepatitis in a 56-year-old female patient at a university hospital who was given rosiglitazone, 8 mg/day, after she developed milder hepatotoxicity while taking troglitazone. Rosiglitazone was discontinued, and the patient was treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and ursodiol. Clinical evaluation and liver biopsy were performed and liver function tests were monitored. After being switched from troglitazone to rosiglitazone the patient developed a severe cholestatic hepatitis with marked jaundice and moderate increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase but only mild increases in serum aminotransferases. Discontinuation of rosiglitazone and treatment with prednisone, azathioprine, and ursodiol led to improvement, albeit with residual injury, dropout of intrahepatic bile ducts, and persisting elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase. Rosiglitazone is not always a safe alternative in patients who have had hepatotoxicity to troglitazone. It is important to monitor the serum alkaline phosphatase in addition to the serum aminotransferases in patients taking thiazolidinediones.",1

DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in the PubMed database to October 2011 (selected using the search terms linagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or diabetes) were identified for review. Reference lists from identified articles were reviewed for additional references of interest. Abstracts published at relevant meetings were also evaluated, and information was obtained from the manufacturer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Publications reporting the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of linagliptin were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Linagliptin therapy results in clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A(1c), as well as fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It contrasts with other agents in its class by not requiring dosage adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Oral doses of linagliptin 5 mg once daily have been shown to be clinically effective, well tolerated, and weight-neutral. An increased rate of hypoglycemia when linagliptin was used in combination with an insulin secretagogue compared to placebo was noted in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin provides an additional therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in contrast to other agents in the DPP-4 class, can be used without dose adjustment in patients with any degree of declining renal function.",1

This study reports on the safety of a combination of albendazole, ivermectin and praziquantel in the treatment of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) in infected children. In this randomised, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial conducted in 235 primary school children aged 5-18 years in Yumbe District in Northern Uganda, the triple combination therapy was compared with the current NTD programme regimen. Liver function testing was performed for all children who received combined therapy. The study included 48 children with LF alone, 60 children with schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni), 41 children with STH, 49 children with schistosomiasis + LF and 37 children with all three types of infection. Children were closely monitored by a paediatrician for any adverse reactions for 7 days. No serious adverse events were experienced. However, 4 of 18 children in the test group and 2 of 3 children in the control group who did not report any ill conditions before treatment developed adverse drug reactions. The combined and conventional therapies were found to be equally safe. The efficacies of both therapies were comparable and satisfactory. [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01050517].",1

2540,15073091,Detection and quantification of heteroplasmic mutant mitochondrial DNA by real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR analysis: a single-step approach,"The A3243G mitochondrial tRNA leu(UUR) point mutation causes mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorder, and is also found in patients with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness syndrome (MIDD). To correlate disease manifestation with mutation loads, it is necessary to measure the percentage of the A3243G mtDNA mutation. To reliably quantify low proportions of the mutant mtDNA, we developed a real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (ARMS-qPCR) assay. We validated the method with experimental samples containing known proportions of mutant A3243G mtDNA generated by mixing known amounts of cloned plasmid DNA containing either the wild-type or the mutant sequences. A correlation coefficient of 0.9995 between the expected and observed values for the proportions of mutant A3243G in the experimental samples was found. Evaluation of a total of 36 patient DNA samples demonstrated consistent results between PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and real-time ARMS-qPCR. However, the latter method was much more sensitive for detecting low percentages of mutant heteroplasmy. Three samples contained allele-specific oligonucleotide-detectable but RFLP-undetectable mutations. The real-time ARMS-qPCR method provides rapid, reliable, one-step quantitative detection of heteroplasmic mutant mtDNA. ",0
2541,9053491,Prospective randomized placebo-controlled study of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor without stem-cell transplantation after high-dose melphalan in patients with multiple myeloma,"""PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or placebo on the durations of intravenous (IV) antibiotic use, hospitalization, neutropenia, and fever, as well as remission rates, after high-dose melphalan (HDM) without stem-cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred two patients with high-risk MM were randomized 2:1 in a prospective multicenter trial to receive 5 microg/kg/d GM-CSF (69 patients) or placebo (33 patients) starting the day after 140 mg/m2 IV melphalan for up to 21 days. RESULTS: GM-CSF significantly reduced neutropenia after HDM (median, 23.5 v 29 days; P = .0468), with a trend to reduce the duration of hospitalization (median, 32 v 38 days; P = .0841). Nevertheless, GM-CSF did not significantly reduce infectious toxicity as regards the number of days with fever (median, 5 v 3; P = .359), the number of days with IV antibiotics (median, 22 v 27; P = .14), or early deaths, with an 11.5% treatment-related mortality rate in the GM-CSF group (eight of 69 v two of 32 patients in the placebo group; P = .686). There was no difference in response rates between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF after HDM without SCT is feasible and significantly shortens neutropenia with a trend toward reduction of hospitalization duration, but does not significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of such therapy. Thus, when intensive therapy is indicated, given that the mortality of HDM followed by SCT reported in the literature is less than 5% and patients are discharged at approximately day 15, despite the risk of contamination by clonogenic malignant cells, SCT appears to be preferable to GM-CSF after HDM.""",1
2542,10573520,Role for tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 and interleukin-1 receptor in the suppression of mouse hepatocyte apoptosis by the peroxisome proliferator nafenopin,"Peroxisome proliferators (PPs) cause rodent liver enlargement and tumors. In vitro, PPs induce rat and mouse hepatocyte DNA synthesis and suppress apoptosis, a response mimicked by exogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Here, we determine the role of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkappaB) in the response of mouse hepatocytes to the PP, nafenopin. Nafenopin (50 micromol/L) induced DNA synthesis as measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, suppressed cell death as measured by Hoechst 33258 staining, induced peroxisomal beta-oxidation as measured by cyanide insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidation (PCO) and caused activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkappaB) as determined by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA). The induction of DNA synthesis and the suppression of apoptosis in response to nafenopin was abrogated completely by blocking antibodies to TNFR1 but not to TNFR2. In contrast, the induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation by nafenopin was not blocked by the anti-TNFR1 antibody. Next, we evaluated the response of hepatocytes to interleukin-1 (IL-1), another proinflammatory cytokine. IL-1alpha (2.5 ng/mL) and, to a lesser extent, IL-1beta (5 ng/mL), shared the ability of TNFalpha to induce DNA synthesis and suppress apoptosis. In addition, anti-IL-1 receptor, type 1/p80 (IL-1R) antibodies were able to abrogate the response to nafenopin. IL-1alpha was still able to perturb hepatocyte growth in the presence of the anti-TNFR1 antibody suggesting that IL-1alpha acts independently rather than by elaborating TNFalpha. In summary, these data provide additional evidence for a role for hepatic cytokines in the perturbation of hepatocyte growth by PPs such as nafenopin.",0
2543,19175782,Methotrexate treatment in 13 children with severe plaque psoriasis,"BACKGROUND: Severe plaque psoriasis in childhood has a significant morbidity and can warrant the use of systemic agents, although there are no published clinical trials in this group. OBJECTIVES: We report a series of 13 children with severe plaque psoriasis treated with low-dose once-weekly methotrexate. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of all 13 children treated with low-dose methotrexate at Birmingham Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 13 patients reviewed, 11 responded with clearance of psoriasis, leaving small residual plaques. Five patients are currently maintained on methotrexate. Three patients needed two courses of methotrexate and one needed three courses, with treatment-free intervals of between 9 and 22 months. One patient stopped treatment due to rises in the results of liver function tests (LFTs) at 6 weeks, and one patient stopped the second course of methotrexate after two doses because of slightly raised baseline LFT results. There were no other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that when carefully monitored, methotrexate can be a safe and efficacious treatment option for severe psoriasis in children as well as in adults. Obesity may be a relative contraindication, as associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is likely to increase hepatotoxicity.",1
2544,28079501,Clinical efficacy of oral alendronate in ankylosing spondylitis: a randomised placebo-controlled trial,"A prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial over 2 years was performed to test the efficacy of alendronate, an oral aminobisphosphonate, in improving symptoms and arrest disease progression in patients with mild to severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS). 180 patients with AS were randomised to receive weekly alendronate 70 mg or placebo (1:1 randomisation). BAS-G was the primary outcome measure with Bath indices as secondary outcomes. Vertebral x-rays were performed at 0 and 24 months. Biomarkers (including CRP, IL-1beta, IL6, VEGF, MMP-1, and MMP-3) were collected during the first 12 months. There was no significant difference between the placebo and treatment groups in any of the recorded outcomes over the 2 years including clinical indices, biomarkers, and radiology. The change in BAS-G, the primary outcome measure, was -0.21 for the treatment group and -0.42 for the placebo group p=0.57. Change in all other clinical outcome measures were also non-significant; BASDAI p=0.86, BASFI p=0.37, BASMI p=0.021. Sub-group analysis of those subjects with a baseline BASDAI >4 were also non-significant. This prospective study demonstrates that alendronate 70mg weekly for 2 years was no more efficacious than placebo in improving clinical or laboratory measures of disease activity or measures of physical impact in subjects with mild to severe active AS.

2545,16632162,Severe liver enzyme elevations after three years of olanzapine treatment: a case report and review of olanzapine associated hepatotoxicity,"Atypical antipsychotics commonly cause isolated asymptomatic increase in the aminotransferase levels. Among these atypical antipsychotics, mostly transient, asymptomatic increase in hepatic enzymes has been reported with olanzapine, however olanzapine rarely may induce a clinical and/or biological hepatic toxicity. The pathogenesis of olanzapine-associated hepatotoxicity is not well known and is mostly a transient phenomenon. However, substantial and lasting changes may occur and result in symptomatic hepatitis. In the following case report, we report on a 44-year-old female patient diagnosed as Bipolar Disorder Type I, whose liver enzyme levels increased ten fold of normal ranges during the third year of the olanzapine treatment and returned to the normal levels within three weeks after olanzapine discontinuation. Although significant liver enzyme elevations are uncommon during olanzapine treatment, based on reports of serious hepatotoxicity, controlled and longitudinal research are needed to learn side effects of this drug on liver. Clinicians should be aware of possible hepatotoxic effects of atypical antipsychotics and should monitor the liver enzyme levels whenever they feel necessary.",1
2546,19085967,Liver damage underlying unexplained transaminase elevation in human immunodeficiency virus-1 mono-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy,"UNLABELLED: Liver damage associated with chronic unexplained high serum transaminases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients under combined antiretroviral therapy is unknown. Liver histology was prospectively investigated in patients presenting serum transaminase elevation for more than 6 months, after exclusion of alcohol abuse, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, autoimmune, and genetic liver diseases. In a subgroup of patients, liver mitochondrial activities were measured by spectrophotometry and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty patients were included with median values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels: 80 U/L, age: 46 years, body mass index: 23 kg/m(2), HIV RNA: 200 copies/mL, CD4 count: 365/mm(3), duration of HIV infection: 13 years, and duration of treatment exposure: 118, 41, and 53 months for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, respectively. Histological anomalies were found in 22 of 30 patients. Steatosis was present in 18 patients, severe in nine patients, and associated with inflammation in 16 patients with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fibrosis was found in 18 patients, severe in six patients and associated with steatosis in 13 patients. Significant liver respiratory complex I defect, contrasting with high complex IV activity and normal mitochondrial DNA content, was observed in the group of patients compared with controls. The presence of NASH was correlated with high fasting glycemia and insulin levels, not with liver mitochondrial function or mitochondrial DNA content. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy with chronic transaminase elevation of unknown origin have a high rate of liver lesions, mostly consistent with NASH related to insulin resistance.",1

To investigate the role of wound natural healing therapy in tumor-like hypertrophic scar. In this study, tumor-like hypertrophic scars of 47 cases were excised completely and the residual wounds were treated with natural healing. The short-term and long-term effects of treatment were evaluated. All cases were successfully cured by natural healing therapy. The healing time of the maximum wound (80mm × 20mm) and the minimal wound (5mm× 5mm) was 25 days and 7 days respectively. The size of new skin scars ranged from 3mm to 11 mm. Clinical followed-up was performed in 34 cases for 36 months. Among them, no recurrence happened in 31 cases and new scar size ranged from 2mm to 8mm, while local recurrence happened in 3 cases whose scar size were less than 5 mm. The cure rate of the therapy was 91.2%. The wound natural healing therapy is effective in treating tumor-like hypertrophic scar, which can prevent recurrence and has good cosmetic results. ",0
2549,25487792,Added benefit of raxibacumab to antibiotic treatment of inhalational anthrax,"""Although antibiotics treat bacteremia in inhalational anthrax, pathogenesis is mainly driven by bacterial exotoxins. Raxibacumab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, binds the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis, thus blocking toxin effects and leading to improved survival in the rabbit and monkey models of inhalational anthrax. To assess raxibacumab's added benefit over levofloxacin (LVX) alone, rabbits surviving to 84 h after a challenge with 200 times the median (50%) lethal dose of B. anthracis spores were randomized to receive 3 daily intragastric LVX doses of 50 mg/kg of body weight, with the first LVX dose administered just prior to administration of a single intravenous dose of placebo or 40 mg/kg raxibacumab. The percentages of animals alive at 28 days following the last LVX dose were compared between the 2 treatment groups using a two-sided likelihood-ratio chi-square test. The 82% survival rate for the LVX-raxibacumab combination was higher than the 65% survival rate for LVX alone (P=0.0874). There were nearly 2-fold fewer deaths for the combination (7 deaths; n=39) than for LVX alone (13 deaths; n=37), and the survival time was prolonged for the combination (P=0.1016). Toxin-neutralizing-activity titers were similar for both treatment groups, suggesting that survivors in both groups were able to mount a toxin-neutralizing immune response. Microscopic findings considered consistent with anthrax were present in animals that died or became moribund on study in both treatment groups, and there were no anthrax-related findings in animals that survived. Overall, raxibacumab provided a meaningful benefit over antibiotic alone when administered late in the disease course.""",1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients with advanced colorectal cancer received PVI 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day for a maximum of 24 weeks and were randomised to PVI 5-FU alone or PVI 5-FU + MMC 10 mg/m2 (7 mg/m2 from June 1995) 6 weekly for 4 courses. RESULTS: Overall response was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1%-63.9%) with PVI 5-FU + MMC compared to 38% (95% CI: 28.3%-47.7%) for PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.024). The median failure free survival was 7.9 months in PVI 5-FU plus MMC and 5.4 months with PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.033) and at one year 31.9% for the combination compared to 17.7% for PVI 5-FU alone. Median survival was 14 months with MMC and 15 months in 5-FU alone; one-year survival 51.7% vs. 57.2%. PVI 5-FU + MMC caused more overall haematological toxicity but CTC grades 3/4 was increased only for thrombocytopaenia. Two patients treated with a cumulative dose of MMC of 40 mg/m2 developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome warranting the reduction in cumulative MMC dose to 28 mg/m2. The global QL scores were better for PVI 5-FU + MMC arm at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences. CONCLUSIONS: PVI 5-FU + MMC results in failure-free survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity and better QL when compared to PVI 5-FU alone but no overall survival advantage. There is no irreversible toxicity with MMC at a cumulative dose of 28 mg/m2.""",1
2551,15239085,Beyond insulin resistance in NASH: TNF-alpha or adiponectin?,"Adiponectin has antilipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, while tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) reduces insulin sensitivity and has proinflammatory effects. We examined (1) the extent to which hypoadiponectinemia and TNF-alpha activation are features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and (2) whether serum levels of these markers correlate with the severity of histological changes in 109 subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including 80 with NASH and 29 with simple steatosis. By multivariate analysis, subjects with NASH had reduced adiponectin level and increased TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2)-but not leptin levels, compared with controls matched by age, sex, and body mass index; these differences were independent of the increased insulin resistance (by homeostasis model [HOMA-IR]) in NASH. When compared with simple steatosis, NASH was associated with lower adiponectin levels and higher HOMA-IR, but there were no significant differences in the levels of TNF-alpha and sTNFR2. The majority of subjects with steatohepatitis (77%) had adiponectin levels less than 10 microg/mL and HOMA-IR greater than 3 units, but only 33% of those with pure steatosis had these findings. HOMA-IR and low serum adiponectin were also independently associated with increased grades of hepatic necroinflammation. In conclusion, hypoadiponectinemia is a feature of NASH independent of insulin resistance. Reduced adiponectin level is associated with more extensive necroinflammation and may contribute to the development of necroinflammatory forms of NAFLD. ",0

All 15 patients who met the entry criteria improved clinically and radiographically within 3 to 10 days after starting treatment. Repeat pulmonary function tests and gallium lung scans after 3 weeks of therapy also showed improvement. Although side effects occurred in 14 patients, in only 2 were they severe enough to require stopping therapy. Both of these patients had worsening skin rash, and dapsone-trimethoprim therapy was stopped after 10 days. When compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine used to treat P. carinii pneumonia in similar patients, oral dapsone-trimethoprim is at least as effective, seems to be better tolerated, and may have a lower frequency of serious side effects.",1

We investigated these effects of cisapride in patients with severe idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis during an eight-week trial. The study design was a two-week single-blind placebo run in period to exclude placebo responders, followed by a six-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase. Delayed gastric emptying of solids on radionuclide scan and a minimum symptom intensity score were inclusion criteria. Forty-three patients were entered: four placebo responders and one other patient were excluded, leaving 19 patients randomized to cisapride (20 mg per os three times a day before meals), and 19 patients to placebo. Seven individual symptoms of gastroparesis were scored in a daily diary and reviewed at two-week visits. Sixteen patients in the cisapride group were able to complete the trial compared to 12 on placebo. The gastric emptying study was repeated at the end of treatment or at the time of withdrawal for those who dropped out. Cisapride significantly increased solid gastric emptying relative to baseline (P = 0.005) whereas placebo did not (P > 0.10). Cisapride did not significantly improve any symptom of gastroparesis relative to baseline or to placebo. We conclude that in a population of severe, refractory gastroparetic patients cisapride significantly accelerates gastric emptying of a solid meal without significantly reducing symptoms during a short-term treatment trial compared to placebo. Further trials of cisapride in less advanced and """"end-stage"""" gastroparetics than studied here or combining cisapride with other prokinetic agents or antiemetics, are warranted.""",1

Adverse effects are rarely observed and since symptoms of hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis are usually negligible, such effects are not well characterized despite large cohort studies of adjuvant tamoxifen. This issue remains to be systematically studied. The present study consisted of 136 breast cancer patients treated with or without tamoxifen. Patients had laboratory tests once each month and underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) annually for 5 years. The extent of hepatic steatosis was assessed by CT as the liver/spleen ratio. While receiving adjuvant tamoxifen, 40 of 105 patients developed hepatic steatosis (liver/spleen ratio <0.9) without obvious changes in body mass index. Twenty-one had a liver spleen ratio of <0.5, whereas none of the 31 patients treated without tamoxifen had a ratio <0.9 or <0.5 (p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Hepatic steatosis was recognized in 35 of the 40 patients within the first 2 years of receiving adjuvant tamoxifen and 21 of the 40 had increased transaminase levels. Liver biopsy revealed NASH in 6 of 7 patients among the 21 with a liver/spleen ratio of <0.5. A subset of individuals given adjuvant tamoxifen developed progressive hepatic steatosis without significant changes in the body mass index. We suggest a liver/spleen ratio of <0.5 as a criterion upon which liver biopsy should be recommended since NASH frequently occurred in such patients.",1

The ability of Jurkat cells to cross a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) monolayer was almost completely abrogated by MIP-1α siRNA. In addition, the overexpression of MIP-1α resulted in the up-regulated expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, which enhanced the migration of Jurkat cells through a monolayer of HBMEC. MIP-1α levels in Jurkat cells appeared to be an important factor for its transendothelial migration, which may provide the theoretical basis to understand the mechanisms of brain metastases of T-ALL at cellular and molecular levels.

Herein we show that overexpression of CXC chemokine ligand12 (CXCL12) considerably improves the viability of isolated rat Langerhans islet cells and Rin-5F pancreatic β-cells after hydrogen peroxide treatment. In rat islets and wt cells hydrogen peroxide treatment induced necrotic cell death that was mediated by the rapid and extensive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). In contrast, CXCL12-overexpressing cells were protected from necrotic cell death as a result of significantly reduced PARP-1 activity. CXCL12 downstream signalling through Akt kinase was responsible for the reduction of PARP-1 activity which switched cell death from necrosis to apoptosis, providing increased protection to cells from oxidative stress. Our results offer a novel aspect of the CXCL12-mediated improvement of β-cell viability which is based on its antinecrotic action through modulation of PARP-1 activity.  ",0
2559,18032762,Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,"""BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is a structural analogue of thalidomide with similar but more potent biologic activity. This phase 3, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: Of 351 patients who had received at least one previous antimyeloma therapy, 176 were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of oral lenalidomide and 175 to receive placebo on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. In addition, all patients received 40 mg of oral dexamethasone on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 for the first four cycles and subsequently, after the fourth cycle, only on days 1 to 4. Patients continued in the study until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was time to progression. RESULTS: The time to progression was significantly longer in the patients who received lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (lenalidomide group) than in those who received placebo plus dexamethasone (placebo group) (median, 11.3 months vs. 4.7 months; P<0.001). A complete or partial response occurred in 106 patients in the lenalidomide group (60.2%) and in 42 patients in the placebo group (24.0%, P<0.001), with a complete response in 15.9% and 3.4% of patients, respectively (P<0.001). Overall survival was significantly improved in the lenalidomide group (hazard ratio for death, 0.66; P=0.03). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that occurred in more than 10% of patients in the lenalidomide group were neutropenia (29.5%, vs. 2.3% in the placebo group), thrombocytopenia (11.4% vs. 5.7%), and venous thromboembolism (11.4% vs. 4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is more effective than high-dose dexamethasone alone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

2560,17993775,Influence of sex hormones on brain excitability and epilepsy,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic problems worldwide. In spite of the many studies carried out, our understanding of generalized epileptogenesis remains far from complete. In recent years many data have clarified the effects of sexual hormones on brain excitability. Female and male sexual hormones may be considered pharmacoactive compounds that alter the seizure threshold, changing the frequency and semeiology of the seizures. In particular, estrogens may increase neuronal excitability while progesterone enhances inhibitions and increases the seizure threshold; on the other hand, androgens can decrease ictal activity in the human brain. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge in this field and highlights some of the prevailing hypotheses about the effects of sexual hormones on neuronal excitability analysing data from both animal and clinical studies.

2561,23703735,Microbiota-liver axis in hepatic disease,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota, long appreciated to be a key determinant of intestinal inflammation, is also playing a key role in chronic inflammatory disease of the liver. Such studies have yielded a general central hypothesis whereby microbiota products activate the innate immune system to drive proinflammatory gene expression, thus promoting chronic inflammatory disease of the liver. This article reviews the background supporting this hypothesis, outlines how it can potentially explain classic and newly emerging epidemiological chronic inflammatory liver disease, and discusses potential therapeutic means to manipulate the microbiota so as to prevent and/or treat liver disease.",0
2562,26324355,Palbociclib: A Novel Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor for Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer,"""OBJECTIVE: To review palbociclib, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, and its current place in therapy for the treatment of hormone receptor (HMR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-negative advanced breast cancer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA ABSTRACTION: Four phase I trials, 2 phase II trials, and 1 phase III trial were identified from May 2004 to May 2015 using PubMed, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) abstracts, and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) abstracts. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the first-line setting, the phase II PALbociclib: Ongoing trials in the Management of breast cAncer (PALOMA)-1 trial randomized patients to receive letrozole alone or letrozole plus palbociclib 125 mg daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off, as initial therapy for advanced breast cancer. The investigator-assessed median progression-free survival (PFS) was 20. 2 months for the combination versus 10.2 months for letrozole alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.488; 95% CI = 0.319-0.748; 1-sided P = 0.0004). The ensuing Food and Drug Administration approval of palbociclib was given a """"breakthrough therapy"""" designation, where preliminary evidence suggests substantial improvement over existing therapies for a serious or life-threatening disease. A confirmatory phase III trial, PALOMA-2, is under way. In patients who were previously treated with endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer, the phase III PALOMA-3 trial randomized patients to fulvestrant plus palbociclib versus fulvestrant plus placebo. The investigator-assessed median PFS at the time of a preplanned analysis was 9.2 months with palbociclib-fulvestrant compared with 3.8 months with placebo-fulvestrant (HR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.32-0.56; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib, the first-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor, significantly extended PFS in combination with endocrine therapy in the first and subsequent lines of treatment for HMR-positive, Her2-negative advanced breast cancer.""",1
2563,16183688,Increased arterial wave reflections predict severe cardiovascular events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions,"Increased arterial wave reflections are associated with the presence and extent of coronary atherosclerosis and with cardiovascular mortality in selected populations. We prospectively evaluated their prognostic value in the short- and long-term following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). We non-invasively quantified wave reflections [expressed as augmentation index corrected for heart rate of 75 b.p.m. (AIx@75)] using applanation tonometry of the radial artery and a validated transfer function to obtain the corresponding aortic values in 262 patients undergoing PCI. During 2-year follow-up, 61 patients reached the primary endpoint [death, myocardial infarction (MI), and restenosis]. Increasing tertiles of Alx@75 were related to the rate of patients reaching the primary endpoint [15.2, 20 and 35.3%, respectively (P = 0.001)], as well as the secondary endpoints total mortality, myocardial infarction and death plus myocardial infarction (RR for the third vs. the first tertile 4.33, 3.25 and 3.46, respectively, P < 0.05). In a multivariable Cox-regression model, AIx@75 added prognostic value above and beyond clinical risk factors, angiographic variables, and medications (RR 1.8, 95%CI 1.18-2.76 per increasing AIx@75-tertile, P < 0.01). Increased arterial wave reflections are independently associated with an increased risk for severe short- and long-term cardiovascular events in patients undergoing PCI. ",0
2564,2699673,Airborne bacteria and viruses,"Coughing, sneezing, talking, bed-making, turning pages of books, etc. all generate microbial aerosols which are carried and dispersed by air movements. Inhalation of these particles may cause allergic responses but whether or not infectious disease ensues depends in part on the viability and infectivity of the inhaled microbes and their landing sites. Desiccation is experienced by all airborne microbes; gram-negative bacteria and lipid-containing viruses demonstrate phase changes in their outer phospholipid bilayer membranes owing to concomitant changes in water content and/or temperature. These changes most likely lead to cross-linking reactions of associated protein moieties principally at mid to high relative humidity (RH). For lipid-free viruses these reactions of their surface protein moieties occur most rapidly at low RH. Radiation, oxygen, ozone and its reaction products and various pollutants also decrease viability and infectivity through chemical, physical and biological modification to phospholipid, protein and nucleic acid moieties. The extent of damage and the degree of repair together with the efficacy of host defence mechanisms largely controls whether the causative microbes take hold and spread disease via the airborne route. At least indoors, where desiccation is the predominant stress, the general reversibility of membrane-phase changes by vapour-phase rehydration when coupled with efficacious microbial enzymatic repair mechanisms under genetic control, virtually ensures the spread of disease by the aerobiological pathway.

2565,10444232,The systemic safety of fexofenadine HCl,"Fexofenadine is a highly specific, H1-receptor antagonist with a safety profile similar to placebo. In placebo-controlled trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), the type and incidence of adverse events were comparable in fexofenadine and placebo recipients. Fexofenadine does not impair performance in tests of driving or psychomotor performance and has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with SAR. Fexofenadine has a high margin of safety and is also well tolerated in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment, in children and the elderly. No clinically significant drug interactions have been identified. Fexofenadine is not associated with cardiotoxicity. Unlike some other antihistamines, such as loratidine or cetirizine [1, 2], fexofenadine is truly non-sedating, showing no dose-related increase in sedation, even at high doses [3, 4]. Fexofenadine is formulated and marketed as the hydrochloride salt. The recommended dose of fexofenadine HC1 is 120 mg daily for SAR (either as 120 mg once daily or 60 mg twice daily) or 180 mg once daily for CIU.",1
2566,30855741,Sleep and Alertness in a Duty-Hour Flexibility Trial in Internal Medicine,"BACKGROUND: A purpose of duty-hour regulations is to reduce sleep deprivation in medical trainees, but their effects on sleep, sleepiness, and alertness are largely unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned 63 internal-medicine residency programs in the United States to follow either standard 2011 duty-hour policies or flexible policies that maintained an 80-hour workweek without limits on shift length or mandatory time off between shifts. Sleep duration and morning sleepiness and alertness were compared between the two groups by means of a noninferiority design, with outcome measures including sleep duration measured with actigraphy, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (with scores ranging from 1 [extremely alert] to 9 [extremely sleepy, fighting sleep]), and a brief computerized Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-B), with long response times (lapses) indicating reduced alertness. RESULTS: Data were obtained over a period of 14 days for 205 interns at six flexible programs and 193 interns at six standard programs. The average sleep time per 24 hours was 6.85 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.61 to 7.10) among those in flexible programs and 7.03 hours (95% CI, 6.78 to 7.27) among those in standard programs. Sleep duration in flexible programs was noninferior to that in standard programs (between-group difference, -0.17 hours per 24 hours; one-sided lower limit of the 95% confidence interval, -0.45 hours; noninferiority margin, -0.5 hours; P?=?0.02 for noninferiority), as was the score on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (between-group difference, 0.12 points; one-sided upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 0.31 points; noninferiority margin, 1 point; P<0.001). Noninferiority was not established for alertness according to the PVT-B (between-group difference, -0.3 lapses; one-sided upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 1.6 lapses; noninferiority margin, 1 lapse; P?=?0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This noninferiority trial showed no more chronic sleep loss or sleepiness across trial days among interns in flexible programs than among those in standard programs. Noninferiority of the flexible group for alertness was not established.

2567,29186402,In vitro and in vivo activity of single and dual antimicrobial agents against KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Options for treatment of infections due to KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are limited and combination therapy is often recommended. In this report, the in vitro and in vivo activity of potential therapeutic agents and combinations was assessed against four KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. Using clinically relevant concentrations, time-kill experiments and the Galleria mellonella model of infection were used to examine the activity of polymyxin B, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem, rifampicin and amikacin alone and in combination. Two K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to polymyxin B and had ceftazidime/avibactam MICs of 8/4 mg/L. When ceftazidime/avibactam was combined with either amikacin or meropenem, synergy was observed in vitro, and these combinations were associated with improved survival in the in vivo model. Improved survival was also observed using higher doses of ceftazidime/avibactam. The other two K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B and had lower (1/4 mg/L) MICs of ceftazidime/avibactam. For these two isolates, bactericidal activity was observed in vitro at ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations four times the MIC. At one-quarter of the MIC, synergy was observed when ceftazidime/avibactam was combined with meropenem. In the in vivo model with the two susceptible isolates, improved survival rates were observed following therapy with ceftazidime/avibactam monotherapy. For all four isolates, polymyxin B with or without rifampicin or meropenem performed poorly in the in vivo model. Pending clinical studies, combining ceftazidime/avibactam with another agent (e.g. a carbapenem) should be considered when treating serious infections due to these pathogens, particularly for isolates with ceftazidime/avibactam MICs near the susceptibility breakpoint.

2568,17982916,Characteristics of GABA receptors on the ocellar L-neurons of American cockroach Periplaneta americana,"The ocellar L-neurons of cockroach Periplaneta americana were used in the present study as model systems to investigate the pharmacological properties of the GABA receptors. To do so, a glass microelectrode was impaled into the axon of the L-neurons to record the membrane potential intracellularly and to monitor membrane response to GABA treatment and cercal stimulation by air puff. The traditional GABA and their receptor agonists were introduced through perfusion and/or iontophoresis to monitor their effects on the L-neurons. The GABA receptor antagonists were administered by perfusion to examine if the response of the L-neurons to GABA and/or cercal stimulation was changed. The results revealed that administration of GABA, muscimol and imidazole acetic acid, two GABAA agonists, produced depolarization on the L-neurons. However, treatment of 3-APS and guanidine acetic acid, another two GABAA agonists, evoked hyperpolarization on the L-neurons. Among those tested antagonists, only picrotoxin, GABAA antagonist, antagonize the depolarization induced by GABA and/or cercal stimulation. More interestingly, administration of strychnine, glycine receptor antagonist, largely attenuated the depolarization response of the L-neurons to cercal stimulation. This attenuation caused by strychnine was even stronger than that initiated by varied GABA antagonists. In addition, phaclofen, a GABAB receptor antagonist, showed no antagonistic effect. These results strongly suggest that the characteristics of GABA receptors of the ocellar L-neurons may differ from those in vertebrates. It may be more likely to be a novel GABA receptor. ",0
2569,9883233,A new operative method to treat high teat stenoses in dairy cows,"To evaluate in a pilot study an alternative technique using theloscopic surgery in the management of proximal teat stenoses of dairy cows. The study included three lactating dairy cows (mean age 3.5 years) with a stenotic fibrous lesion in the proximal region of a teat. The lesions were suspected to be of traumatic origin and the diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasonography. For surgery, the cows were sedated and the base of the teat anaesthetized. The resectoscope was introduced through an incision in the teat cistern. The surgical area was continuously irrigated with saline solution and the stenotic lesions electroresected. Haemorrhage was controlled whenever possible by electrocoagulation. In two cows, the procedure was successful and resulted in normal milk flow. One of the two cows was slaughtered soon after the operation for reasons unrelated to udder health. The other cow could be milked normally at a follow-up examination 4 months later and on ultrasonography, there was no recurrence of the stenotic lesions. In both cows, there was no evidence of concurrent intramammary infection. In the third cow, the procedure had to be discontinued because of severe intraoperative haemorrhage. Video-assisted theloscopic electroresection of fibrotic teats is a promising, novel and minimally invasive technique for the surgical correction of the glandular part of the cistern. It should be considered as an alternative to conventional surgical methods in valuable dairy cows. ",0

In this review, we summarize the salient and novel elements of this conference and provide directions for future clinical trial design. The article follows the structure of the conference and is organized into five areas: (1) antifibrotic trial design; (2) preclinical proof-of-concept studies; (3) pharmacological targets, including rationale and lessons to learn; (4) rational drug design and development; and (5) consensus and recommendations on design of clinical trials in liver fibrosis. Expert overviews and collaborative discussions helped to summarize the key unmet needs and directions for the future, including: (1) greater clarification of at-risk populations and study groups; (2) standardization of all elements of drug discovery and testing; (3) standardization of clinical trial approaches; (4) accelerated development of improved noninvasive markers; and (5) need for exploration of potential off-target toxicities of future antifibrotic drugs.",0
2571,26213553,Hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus mimicking Mauriac syndrome,"Hepatic glycogenosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) can be caused by poor glycemic control due to insulin deficiency, excessive insulin treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, or excessive glucose administration to control hypoglycemia. Mauriac syndrome, which is characterized by hepatomegaly due to hepatic glycogenosis, growth retardation, delayed puberty, and Cushingoid features, is a rare diabetic complication. We report a case of hepatic glycogenosis mimicking Mauriac syndrome. A 14-year-old girl with poorly controlled type 1 DM was admitted to The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital for abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and a Cushingoid face. The growth rate of the patient had decreased, and she had not yet experienced menarche. Laboratory findings revealed elevated liver enzyme levels. A liver biopsy confirmed hepatic glycogenosis. Continuous glucose monitoring showed hyperglycemia after meals and frequent hypoglycemia before meals. To control hyperglycemia, we increased insulin dosage by using an insulin pump. In addition, we prescribed uncooked cornstarch to prevent hypoglycemia. After strict blood glucose control, the patient's liver functions and size normalized. The patient subsequently underwent menarche. Hepatic glycogenosis is a complication of type 1 DM that is reversible with appropriate glycemic control.",1
2572,10099139,The mode of delivery and the risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1--a meta-analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the relation between elective cesarean section and vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we performed a meta-analysis using data on individual patients from 15 prospective cohort studies. METHODS: North American and European studies of at least 100 mother-child pairs were included in the meta-analysis. Uniform definitions of modes of delivery were used. Elective cesarean sections were defined as those performed before onset of labor and rupture of membranes. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to adjust for other factors known to be associated with vertical transmission. RESULTS: The primary analysis included data on 8533 mother-child pairs. After adjustment for receipt of antiretroviral therapy, maternal stage of disease, and infant birth weight, the likelihood of vertical transmission of HIV-1 was decreased by approximately 50 percent with elective cesarean section, as compared with other modes of delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 0.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.56). The results were similar when the study population was limited to those with rupture of membranes shortly before delivery. The likelihood of transmission was reduced by approximately 87 percent with both elective cesarean section and receipt of antiretroviral therapy during the prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal periods, as compared with other modes of delivery and the absence of therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.19). Among mother-child pairs receiving antiretroviral therapy during the prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal periods, rates of vertical transmission were 2.0 percent among the 196 mothers who underwent elective cesarean section and 7.3 percent among the 1255 mothers with other modes of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that elective cesarean section reduces the risk of transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child independently of the effects of treatment with zidovudine.",0
2573,24324290,Predictive value of admission N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and renal function in older people hospitalized for dyspnoea,"We investigated the relationship between NT-pro-BNP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and all-cause mortality rates in a cohort of older people discharged from an internal medicine unit after admission for dyspnoea. NT-pro-BNP was evaluated in serum samples of 134 patients aged 80 ± 6 years who presented to a single academic centre with worsening dyspnoea. History data and anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical parameters including GFR were collected at the time of admission. 119 out of 134 were discharged alive from hospital and were included in the follow-up of 779 ± 370 days. 35 out of 119 subjects died after a follow-up of 266 ± 251 days. Cox proportional hazards model showed that GFR and Ln (NT-pro-BNP) were predictors for all-cause mortality with estimated hazard ratios of 0.969 (95% confidence interval: 0.950-0.988; P = 0.001) and 2.360 (95% confidence interval: 1.208-4.610; P = 0.012), respectively. Patients characterized by high NT-pro-BNP levels and GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) showed a dramatic reduction in survival duration compared with the groups with different combinations of the two variables (P = 0.008). In the elderly, NT-pro-BNP and GFR are predictors of all-cause mortality after admission because of dyspnoea. Since the fact that subjects with high NT-pro-BNP and GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) exhibited a reduced survival, high admission NT-pro-BNP suggests future negative outcome. ",0
2574,12527609,Pyrazinamide and rifampin vs isoniazid for the treatment of latent tuberculosis: improved completion rates but more hepatotoxicity,"CONTEXT: American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend a 9-month course of therapy with isoniazid for treatment of persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are at high risk for reactivation of disease. Major liver injury has been reported with the alternative regimen, a 2-month course of pyrazinamide and rifampin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate of completion and incidence of hepatotoxicity of a short regimen of pyrazinamide and rifampin for latent tuberculosis as compared with standard isoniazid therapy before and after instituting an intensive monitoring program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 224 patients in a community setting between 1999 and 2001. INTERVENTIONS: Daily pyrazinamide and rifampin for 2 months or daily isoniazid for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment completion, hepatotoxicity (fourfold increase of alanine transaminase [ALT]), severe hepatotoxicity (40-fold increase in ALT). RESULTS: Treatment was completed by 71% (78 of 110 patients) in the pyrazinamide/rifampin group and by 59% (67 of 114 patients) in the isoniazid group (p = 0.07). Hepatotoxicity (ALT > 160 U/L) was documented in 13% (14 of 110 patients) in the pyrazinamide/rifampin group and in 4% (5 of 114 patients) in the isoniazid group (p = 0.03). Severe hepatotoxicity (ALT > 1,600 U/L) occurred in 2 of 43 patients (5%) receiving pyrazinamide/rifampin prior to instituting intensive monitoring. Once more intensive monitoring of liver enzymes was implemented, severe hepatotoxicity occurred in none of 67 patients. CONCLUSION: The risk of hepatitis in patients receiving pyrazinamide/rifampin for prevention of latent tuberculosis is increased threefold as compared to patients receiving isoniazid. When patients were monitored more intensively, severe hepatotoxicity did not develop, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.15).",1
2575,24314775,Stasis dermatitis as a complication of recurrent levofloxacin-associated bilateral leg edema,"Several drugs have been associated with the development of peripheral edema. Leg edema can result in dermatitis of the lower extremities. We describe levofloxacin-induced peripheral leg edema, which progressed to stasis dermatitis. A 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma was administered intravenous vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam by injection for treatment of aspiration pneumonia. Prior to discharge, the patient's antibiotic therapy was switched to oral levofloxacin. The patient developed drug-associated bilateral peripheral leg edema and stasis dermatitis. Both the dermatitis and leg edema resolved after withdrawal of levofloxacin and administration of topical corticosteroid therapy. The patient had a similar reaction to levofloxacin one year prior, which had subsided with discontinuation of the drug. Several medications have been documented to cause leg edema and secondary stasis dermatitis. The timing, recurrence, and resolution of edema and stasis dermatitis with respect to the administration and termination of levofloxacin suggest that the leg edema and stasis dermatitis occurred secondary to levofloxacin administration. Levofloxacin can be added to the list of drugs associated with the development of peripheral leg edema. Stasis dermatitis proceeded by lower extremity edema can be added to the list of adverse events associated with levofloxacin. ",0

2577,24550331,Large retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of ceftaroline fosamil therapy,"Ceftaroline has been approved for acute bacterial skin infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Limited clinical experience exists for use outside these indications. The objective of this study was to describe the outcomes of patients treated with ceftaroline for various infections. Retrospective analyses of patients receiving ceftaroline ?72 h from 2011 to 2013 were included. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were analyzed. Clinical success was defined as resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection with no further need for escalation while on ceftaroline treatment during hospitalization. A total of 527 patients received ceftaroline, and 67% were treated for off-label indications. Twenty-eight percent (148/527) of patients had bacteremia. Most patients (80%) were initiated on ceftaroline after receipt of another antimicrobial, with 48% citing disease progression as a reason for switching. The median duration of ceftaroline treatment was 6 days, with an interquartile range of 4 to 9 days. A total of 327 (62%) patients were culture positive, and the most prevalent pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus, with a frequency of 83% (271/327). Of these patients, 88.9% (241/271) were infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Clinically, 88% (426/484) achieved clinical success and hospital mortality was seen in 8% (40/527). While on ceftaroline, adverse events were experienced in 8% (41/527) of the patients and 9% (28/307) were readmitted within 30 days after discharge for the same infection. Patients treated with ceftaroline for both FDA-approved and off-label infections had favorable outcomes. Further research is necessary to further describe the role of ceftaroline in a variety of infections and its impact on patient outcomes.",1
2578,3676923,Treatment of spasticity with tizanidine in multiple sclerosis,"Spasticity is a frequent and often disabling symptom in MS patients. Current drugs used as antispastic agents include Dantrolene Sodium, Baclofen and Diazepam. Tizanidine (5-chloro-4-(2imidazolin-2 yl amino)-2,1,3-benzothialdiazole) is a new antispasticity agent that has purported central action. A double blind placebo controlled trial was performed to study the efficacy of this drug in MS patients. Sixty-six patients entered an eight week therapeutic trial and fifty-nine completed the trial. Patients were assessed at 0, 2, 3 and 8 weeks of therapy for clinical effects. Electrophysiologic tests were performed at 0 and 8 weeks. A statistically significant benefit was noted in spastic muscle groups in the legs with concomitant significant reduction in hyperactive stretch reflexes and ankle clonus. Side effects most frequently cited included dry mouth and drowsiness. Two patients developed elevated liver function test that decreased with cessation of therapy. Other clinical details, side effects and electrophysiologic data will be presented. Tizanidine appears to reduce clinical spasticity and hyperreflexia in MS patients although no change in functional status was detected. Tizanidine may well serve as an alternate antispastic agent, alone or in combination with other agents.",1
2579,17983381,Usefulness of intradermal test and patch test in the diagnosis of nonimmediate reactions to metamizol,"Metamizole is a pyrazolone derivative, and its most common reactions are IgE-mediated reaction and idiosyncratic reactions. Non-immediate reactions are poorly described and there are very few reports on non-immediate reactions to pyrazolones. We evaluated 12 patients (nine men) who consulted for a non-immediate reaction after metamizol administration. We performed cutaneous tests (skin prick tests and immediate and delayed intradermal tests) and epicutaneous tests, and, if necessary, an oral challenge test. All skin prick and intradermal tests, if necessary, were negative in immediate reading. Delayed intradermal tests were positive in six of 10 patients (60%) and epicutaneous tests were positive in four of 11 patients (36%). Three cases (25%), were diagnosed by a positive oral challenge test. Delayed-reading intradermal tests and patch tests are useful tools in the diagnosis of nonimmediate reactions to pyrazolones and should be considered the first step when evaluating these type of reactions. Intradermal test appears to be more sensitive than patch test. The positivity of skin tests suggests an immunological reaction, probably mediated by T lymphocytes, but further studies are required.

2580,6848934,Absence of cytochrome b-245 in chronic granulomatous disease. A multicenter European evaluation of its incidence and relevance,"The heme-containing protein cytochrome b-245 has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes that normally generates superoxide-free radicals but when defective is associated with chronic granulomatous disease. We measured this cytochrome in granulocytes from 27 patients with chronic granulomatous disease and from 64 members of their families. It was undetectable in all 19 of the men in whom the defect appeared to be located on the X chromosome. Female relatives who were heterozygous carriers had reduced concentrations of the cytochrome and variable proportions of cells that were unable to generate superoxide; these two characteristics were closely related (r = 0.93 in the 16 mothers and 0.85 in all 24 carriers, P less than 0.001). In contrast, in all eight patients (seven women) with a probable autosomal recessive inheritance the cytochrome was present but nonfunctional. The properties tested, including midpoint potential, carbon monoxide binding, and organelle distribution, were normal, but the cytochrome did not undergo reduction on cellular stimulation. Thus, absence or malfunction of the cytochrome b-245 may be the causal molecular defect in chronic granulomatous disease, implicating it in the microbicidal oxidase system.",0
2581,581782,Comparison of the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs with different ancillary properties in angina pectoris,"We compared the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents in 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. Acute dose-response studies showed that all five drugs improved exercise tolerance and reduced ST-segment depression, heart rate and blood pressure by a similar degree in comparison with a placebo (P less than 0.01). Near maximum improvement in exercise tolerance occurred when the acute cumulative oral dose had reached 160 mg for propranolol and oxprenolol, 200 mg for metoprolol and tolamolol and 400 mg for practolol. When these drugs were administered as a single doses, increase in walking time before the development of angina and reduction in ST-segment depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure all occurred within one hour and persisted for eight hours--effects markedly different from the response to a placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that non-cardioselective agents (propranolol and oxprenolol), cardioselective agents (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol), as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.",0
2582,11941968,Metronidazol as a probable cause of severe liver injury,"""Metronidazol, a commonly used antibiotic drug, has been very rarely associated with hepatotoxicity. In particular, no reports have appeared in the literature about cases of metronidazol-associated severe hepatotoxicity, leading to liver transplantation or death. We report on a case of acute fulminant liver failure in a young woman, who had, two years previously, developed jaundice after intake of metronidazol. During the current hospitalization, metronidazol treatment had been undertaken two weeks previously and also this time the patient developed severe hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. A viral etiology was ruled out as well as vascular, metabolic and malignant etiology. Although, the cause of the liver injury in this case is not proven, the relationship between this drug and two occasions of severe liver damage, suggests a positive challenge as well as rechallenge. An International algorithm was used for the assessment of the causality of a drug in this case of acute liver injury and a """"probable"""" classification was obtained.""",1

The reported side effects of each drug have been listed with particular emphasis on the possibility of hepatic damage. All oral antifungal agents cause minor gastrointestinal upset, as well as headache and skin reactions. There is also a rare incidence of reversible hepatic damage. Although the incidence of abnormal liver function tests from oral antifungal therapy is extremely low, patients should be advised to inform their physician if any warning symptoms are noticed.",1
2584,10210707,Identification of common germinal-center B-cell precursors in two patients with both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma occasionally occur in the same patient. The identification of a common precursor of the two types of lymphoma would show definitively that Reed-Sternberg cells originate from B cells. METHODS: We studied lymphomas from two patients, one with a composite lymphoma (classic Hodgkin's disease and a follicular lymphoma in the same lymph node) and the other with a T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma that was followed by classic Hodgkin's disease. Single Reed-Sternberg cells and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells from frozen sections were micromanipulated. The rearranged immunoglobulin variable-region genes (V genes) of the heavy and light chains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and sequenced. RESULTS: In both patients, the Reed-Sternberg cells were related clonally to the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cells. The V genes carried somatic mutations (a hallmark of germinal-center B cells and their descendants). In both patients, some somatic mutations were shared by the Reed-Sternberg and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, whereas other somatic mutations were found exclusively in one or the other cell type. CONCLUSIONS: In two patients with classic Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, we identified a common B-cell precursor, probably a germinal-center B-cell, for both lymphomas. This finding suggests that the two types of lymphoma underwent both shared and distinct transforming events and provides proof of the B-cell derivation of Reed-Sternberg cells in classic Hodgkin's disease.",0
2585,1423181,Phase III double-blind comparison of intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide as antiemetic therapy for patients receiving multiple-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy,"BACKGROUND: Ondansetron hydrochloride is a selective serotonin subtype 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonist that has been shown to be an effective antiemetic in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: This double-blind study compared the safety and efficacy of intravenous ondansetron with metoclopramide in patients receiving a 4- or 5-day regimen of cisplatin (20-40 mg/m2/day) combination chemotherapy. Forty-five patients were enrolled, and efficacy of the drug therapy could be studied for all 45. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three daily intravenous doses of either 0.15 mg/kg ondansetron or 1 mg/kg metoclopramide. All patients were monitored daily for the number of emetic episodes (vomiting or retching), severity of nausea, adverse events, and laboratory safety parameters. RESULTS: Seven (30%) patients who received ondansetron had no emetic episodes throughout the entire study period compared with two (9%) who received metoclopramide (P = 0.077). The greatest difference in antiemetic efficacy was seen on day 1, when 18 (78%) patients who received ondansetron had no emetic episodes compared with 3 (14%) patients who received metoclopramide (P < 0.001). Significantly fewer antiemetic treatment failures (more than five emetic episodes or withdrawal from the study) occurred with patients given ondansetron (9%) than with those given metoclopramide (50%) during the entire study period (P = 0.002). The most commonly reported adverse event associated with ondansetron therapy was headache (controlled with acetaminophen), whereas diarrhea and restlessness were the most commonly reported adverse events associated with metoclopramide therapy. Extrapyramidal symptoms were judged to have occurred in 13 patients who received metoclopramide and 1 patient who received ondansetron. However, the patient who received ondansetron subsequently was judged to have had an anxiety attack. In patients with low or normal baseline transaminase values, a greater percentage who received ondansetron had transient increases as great as twice the upper limit of normal in aspartate transaminase (5% versus 0%) and alanine transaminase (17% versus 6%) than those who received metoclopramide. CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is superior to metoclopramide as antiemetic therapy for multiple-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy.",1
2586,19995399,Salvage treatment for children with refractory first or second relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia with gemtuzumab ozogamicin: results of a phase II study,"The prognosis of children with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is poor, and new therapies are needed. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an anti-CD33 antibody linked to the antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. We conducted an investigator-initiated phase II study with GO to assess its efficacy and safety, administering two dosages of 7.5 mg/m(2) with a 14 d-interval. Thirty children who were refractory to re-induction at first relapse or suffered from second relapse of AML received a total of 64 infusions of GO. The response rate [complete remission (CR) and CR with insufficient platelet recovery] was 37%. Nine patients were subsequently transplanted (median time to transplant, 4 weeks, range 3-21 weeks), and three of these patients are currently in continuous CR with a median follow-up of >3 years, and can considered to be cured. This resulted in a statistically significant survival advantage for children who responded to GO versus those who did not [27% (standard error 13%) vs. 0%, respectively, P = 0.001]. All other children died, mainly from progressive disease. The treatment was generally well tolerated by most patients. The frequency of transient transaminatis was low. All but one patient received defibrotide prophylaxis during the transplant procedure, and no cases of veno-occlusive disease were noted. This study showed a favourable safety/efficacy profile of single-agent GO in children with refractory first or second relapse of AML.",1
2587,9562589,Accidental nuclear war--a post-cold war assessment,"BACKGROUND: In the 1980s, many medical organizations identified the prevention of nuclear war as one of the medical profession's most important goals. An assessment of the current danger is warranted given the radically changed context of the post-Cold War era. METHODS: We reviewed the recent literature on the status of nuclear arsenals and the risk of nuclear war. We then estimated the likely medical effects of a scenario identified by leading experts as posing a serious danger: an accidental launch of nuclear weapons. We assessed possible measures to reduce the risk of such an event. RESULTS: U.S. and Russian nuclear-weapons systems remain on a high-level alert status. This fact, combined with the aging of Russian technical systems, has recently increased the risk of an accidental nuclear attack. As a conservative estimate, an accidental intermediate-sized launch of weapons from a single Russian submarine would result in the deaths of 6,838,000 persons from firestorms in eight U.S. cities. Millions of other people would probably be exposed to potentially lethal radiation from fallout. An agreement to remove all nuclear missiles from high-level alert status and eliminate the capability of a rapid launch would put an end to this threat. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of an accidental nuclear attack has increased in recent years, threatening a public health disaster of unprecedented scale. Physicians and medical organizations should work actively to help build support for the policy changes that would prevent such a disaster.",0

In the chemical composition analysis, 27 compounds representing 86.69-95.03% of the total essential oils were identified and quantified. The main constituents in essential oils were terpenoids, alcohols and fatty acids accounting for 15.03-24.36%, 21.57-34.43% and 33.06-57.37%, respectively. Moreover, the analysis also revealed that essential oils from different extraction stages possessed different chemical compositions. In the antioxidant evaluation, all analysed oils showed similar antioxidant behaviours, and the concentrations of essential oils providing 50% inhibition of DPPH-scavenging activity (IC50) were about 25 mg/mL. In the antimicrobial experiments, essential oils from different extraction stages exhibited different antimicrobial activities. The antimicrobial activity of oils was affected by extraction stages. By controlling extraction stages, it is promising to obtain essential oils with desired antimicrobial activities. ",0
2589,2696250,Quantitative image analysis in nuclear cardiology as a decision aid in addition to visual assessment of findings],"Quantitative analysis of nuclear cardiology procedures has stimulated tremendous work in the past and will continue to do so in the future. The impact on routine patient care has grown at a slower pace and should be assessed separately for tissue perfusion and for myocardial contraction. The current status will be presented, focusing on patients with coronary heart disease. In the preinfarct period myocardial scintigraphy with thallium-201 and emission computer tomography (ECT) is the preferred method. The procedure for quantitation includes transfer of all data into a standard polar map and comparing the numbers with a normal, gender-matched data base. The result reveals areas of reduced tracer uptake, color-coded according to the level of significance. Interpretation of these colored polar maps might appear simple, but in fact requires a substantial amount of knowledge to avoid overinterpretation of the results. This has led us to a restricted use of this quantitative tool: following an initial step of reading the original data in terms of short and long axes slices of the left myocardium, the polar map is utilized for verification and for suggestions of any additional lesions. This has to be confirmed by a second reading of the slices, and only this last step defines the lesions to be reported. Quantitation used in this dialectic approach avoids inclusion of artefacts, and at the same time is useful experience for trainees. Furthermore, it allows easy presentation during the clinical conference and statistical analysis of groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ",0
2590,8297198,Acute liver injury associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the role of risk factors,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations for acute liver injury in the absence of a viral infection or any other well-defined pathologic finding that could have caused it is rare. In this study, we included both outpatients and hospitalized patients with acute liver injury to estimate the risk of clinically important acute liver injury associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to study the role of certain risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study with secondary case-control analysis. The study included 536 general practitioners' practices in England and Wales for the period October 1987 through August 1991. A total of 625,307 persons who received more than 2 million prescriptions for one of 12 NSAIDs were followed up to estimate the risk of newly diagnosed acute liver injury. RESULTS: There were 23 cases of acute liver injury. The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per 100,000 NSAID prescriptions. None of the cases had a fatal outcome. Sulindac was the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that for the overall NSAID group. Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis had a 10-fold increased risk of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis. Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications also increased the risk. Transient minor increases in liver test values were not a useful predictor of diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although NSAIDs have been found to be associated with acute liver injury in a small number of persons, the risk is sufficiently small as to be of minimal concern for most NSAIDs.",1
2591,15221881,Resistance training exercise and creatine in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"Resistance exercise and creatine supplementation independently improve strength and function in patients with certain neuromuscular diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of resistance training with and without creatine supplementation on muscle, strength, and function in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Twenty patients with CMT consumed 5 g/day creatine or placebo while participating in resistance training for 12 weeks. Energy metabolites, muscle fiber type and size, strength, and timed activities of daily living were measured before and after training. There were no differences between creatine or placebo groups for any outcome. For the groups combined, exercise training increased type I muscle fiber diameter (48.2 +/- 14.2 microm vs. 55.4 +/- 14.8 microm), strength, and activities of daily living (ADL) times. Thus, patients respond to resistance training with muscle fiber adaptations, and improvements in strength and function. Creatine was not beneficial. ",0
2592,23727264,Efficacy and safety of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"""BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obeticholic acid (OCA; INT-747, 6?-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid) is a semisynthetic derivative of the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid, the natural agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. In animal models, OCA decreases insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the effects of OCA on insulin sensitivity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 23), 25 mg OCA (n = 20), or 50 mg OCA (n = 21) once daily for 6 weeks. A 2-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp was used to measure insulin sensitivity before and after the 6-week treatment period. We also measured levels of liver enzymes, lipid analytes, fibroblast growth factor 19, 7?-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (a BA precursor), endogenous bile acids, and markers of liver fibrosis. RESULTS: When patients were given a low-dose insulin infusion, insulin sensitivity increased by 28.0% from baseline in the group treated with 25 mg OCA (P = .019) and 20.1% from baseline in the group treated with 50 mg OCA (P = .060). Insulin sensitivity increased by 24.5% (P = .011) in combined OCA groups, whereas it decreased by 5.5% in the placebo group. A similar pattern was observed in patients given a high-dose insulin infusion. The OCA groups had significant reductions in levels of ?-glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase and dose-related weight loss. They also had increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 19, associated with decreased levels of 7?-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and endogenous bile acids, indicating activation of farnesoid X receptor. Markers of liver fibrosis decreased significantly in the group treated with 25 mg OCA. Adverse experiences were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial, administration of 25 or 50 mg OCA for 6 weeks was well tolerated, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Longer and larger studies are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT00501592.""",1
2593,8088258,The long-term safety and efficacy of gabapentin (Neurontin) as add-on therapy in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. The US Gabapentin Study Group,"This is the 2-year interim report of results from a multicenter, open-label study evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of gabapentin (Neurontin) as add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial seizures who had had a therapeutic response to gabapentin in a preceding 12-week double-blind trial or 12-week open-label extension. A total of 240 patients continued to receive gabapentin as add-on therapy at dosages of 600-2400 mg/day for an average of 342 days (range 10-784 days). Efficacy analyses compared seizure frequency during consecutive 12-week treatment periods with seizure frequency during the 12-week baseline. During the nine treatment periods evaluated, the percent of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency ranged from 35% to 71%, and the median percent change in seizure frequency ranged from -33% to -60%. At the time of data cutoff, 30% of patients had withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy, and 4% due to adverse events. In 225 patient-years of gabapentin treatment in this study, CNS adverse events reported by more than 10% of patients were nystagmus, somnolence, diplopia, tremor, ataxia, and dizziness. No consistent changes in clinical laboratory values were associated with gabapentin. Gabapentin as add-on therapy at dosages up to 2400 mg/day is safe during long-term treatment in patients with refractory partial seizures. Subgroup analyses of patients who remained in the study over the long term confirmed that gabapentin maintained efficacy for up to 2 years.",1

It has several advantages over currently available carbapenems and other classes of drugs used in this indication. This prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study was designed to establish whether doripenem was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in NP. METHODS: Adults (n=448) with signs and symptoms of NP, including non-ventilated patients and those ventilated for <5 days, were stratified by ventilation mode, illness severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score), and geographic region and then randomly allocated to treatment with doripenem 500 mg every 8 h by a 1-h intravenous (IV) infusion or piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 h by 30-min IV infusion. After receiving IV study drug for at least 72 h, eligible patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin 750 mg once daily. Antibiotic therapy was continued for a total of 7-14 days. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate, assessed 7-14 days after treatment completion, in clinically evaluable patients and in the clinical modified intent-to-treat population (cMITT). TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00211003. RESULTS: Doripenem was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam. Clinical cure rates in clinically evaluable patients (n=253) were 81.3% in the doripenem arm and 79.8% in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm (between-treatment difference: 1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.1 to 12.1%) and in the cMITT population 69.5% and 64.1%, respectively, (between-treatment difference: 5.4%; 95% CI, -4.1 to 14.8%). Baseline resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam was 44% and 26.9%, respectively; a doripenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >8 mug/mL occurred in 0% and 7.7%, respectively. Favorable microbiological outcome rates against Gram-negative pathogens were numerically higher with doripenem than with piperacillin/tazobactam, but the difference was not statistically significant. Both study drugs were generally well tolerated, as only 16.1% and 17.6% of patients receiving doripenem and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively, had a drug-related adverse event. Study limitations included the open-label design, the low rate of monotherapy (adjunctive use of aminoglycoside was required when P. aeruginosa was suspected), and the exclusion of the most critically ill and immunocompromized patients. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem was clinically and microbiologically effective in patents with NP, including those with early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia, and was therapeutically noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam.""",1

2599,30743066,Effect of deuteration on the phase behaviour and structure of lamellar phases of phosphatidylcholines - Deuterated lipids as proxies for the physical properties of native bilayers,"Deuteration of phospholipids is a common practice to elucidate membrane structure, dynamics and function, by providing selective visualisation in neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy. It is generally assumed that the properties of the deuterated lipids are identical to those of the protiated lipids, and while a number of papers have compared the properties of different forms, to date this has been no systematic study of the effects over a range of conditions. Here we present a study of the effects of deuteration on the organisation and phase behaviour of four common phospholipids (DSPC, DPPC, DMPC, DOPC), observing the effect of chain deuteration and headgroup deuteration on lipid structure and phase behaviour. For saturated lipids in excess water the gel-fluid phase transition temperature is 4.3 ± 0.1 °C lower for lipids with deuterated chains compared to protiated chains, consistent with previous work. Despite this significant change, well away from the transition structural changes as measured by powder small angle X-ray scattering are small and within errors. To investigate this further, measurements were carried out on oriented multilamellar stacks of DOPC in the fluid phase at reduced hydration. Neutrons are used in conjunction with contrast variation to elucidate the role of the deuteration explicitly. It is found that deuterated chains cause a reduction in the lamellar repeat spacing and bilayer thickness, but deuterated headgroups cause an increase. Consequences for the interpretation of Neutron Scattering data with deuterated lipids are discussed. ",0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab and antitumour necrosis factor therapy in patients with psoriasis and concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicentre study. Twenty-five patients with psoriasis and concurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) (20 patients) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (five patients) infection who had received at least one biologic agent (etanercept, 21 treatments; adalimumab, four; ustekinumab, four; infliximab, two) were included. Clinical, imaging and laboratory data were recorded. RESULTS: In the case of HCV infection, the majority of the patients did not exhibit increases in their viral load or serum liver tests. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase were doubled from the baseline measurement in only one patient treated with etanercept. Two other cases exhibited viral load increases during the follow-up period. In total, 18 of the 26 treatments achieved a 75% improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) score during the follow-up period. Two patients treated with etanercept were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. In the case of HBV infection, all of the patients were being treated with antiviral therapy, and none presented significant variations in viral load or serum liver enzymes. All patients achieved a PASI 75 during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic therapy was effective and safe for the majority of our patients with HCV and HBV infection, although there may be a risk of reactivation or aggravation. We describe the first cases to receive ustekinumab. The use of biologics should be limited to those cases in which the risk-benefit ratio is justified.""",1
2602,16941702,CD4+ immune escape and subsequent T-cell failure following chimpanzee immunization against hepatitis C virus,"Hepatitis C is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with 170 million individuals infected worldwide and no available vaccine. We analyzed the effects of an induced T-cell response in 3 chimpanzees, targeting nonstructural proteins in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. In all animals the specific T-cell response modified the outcome of infection, producing a 10- to 1,000-fold reduction in peak virus titers. The challenge of 2 immunized animals that had been previously exposed to hepatitis C virus resulted in subclinical infections. Immune responses in the third animal, naive prior to immunization, limited viral replication immediately, evidenced by a 30-fold reduction in virus titer by week 2, declining to a nonquantifiable level by week 6. After 10 weeks of immunological control, we observed a resurgence of virus, followed by progression to a persistent infection. Comparing virus evolution with T-cell recognition, we demonstrated that: (i) resurgence was concomitant with the emergence of new dominant viral populations bearing single amino acid changes in the NS3 and NS5A regions, (ii) these mutations resulted in a loss of CD4+ T-cell recognition, and (iii) subsequent to viral resurgence and immune escape a large fraction of NS3-specific T cells became impaired in their ability to secrete IFN-gamma and proliferate. In contrast, NS3-specific responses were sustained in the recovered/immunized animals presenting with subclinical infections. In conclusion, viral escape from CD4+ T cells can result in the eventual failure of an induced T-cell response that initially controls infection. Vaccines that can induce strong T-cell responses prior to challenge will not necessarily prevent persistent HCV infection.",0

We divided 8-week-old male Wistar-ST rats into 3 groups: sham-operated rats (control group), arteriogenic ED rats who underwent ligation of both internal iliac arteries (ligation group), and arteriogenic ED rats receiving oral 2% L-citrulline water supplementation (citrulline group). Citrulline water was given to arteriogenic ED rats for 3 weeks from 1 week after surgery. Erectile function was evaluated by maximum intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) ratios via cavernous nerve stimulation at 4 weeks after surgery. Then, the penises were resected, stained with Masson's trichrome, and observed microscopically. Serum nitrogen oxides (NOx) levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Bonferroni's multiple t-test was used for statistical analysis. The main outcome measures were changes in ICP/MAP, smooth muscle (SM)/collagen ratios, and NOx levels following L-citrulline supplementation. The ICP/MAP ratio in the ligation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05), denoting ED. The ICP/MAP ratio of the citrulline group was significantly higher than that of the ligation group (P<0.05), indicating ED amelioration. Levels of NOx in the ligation group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05), while those in the citrulline group were significantly higher than in the ligation group (P<0.05). SM/collagen ratios in the ligation group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05), while ratios in the citrulline group were significantly higher than those in the ligation group (P<0.05). Oral L-citrulline supplementation improved ICP/MAP and SM/collagen ratios and increased NOx. Therefore, oral L-citrulline supplementation might be a useful novel therapy for acute arteriogenic ED.

2605,22595892,Cardiac rehabilitation participant with sickle cell trait and statin-related hepatotoxicity: a case report,"PURPOSE: Exercise recommendations for patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) and myocardial infarction (MI) are limited. This case report describes such a patient, who subsequently participated in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CASE: Patient experienced sudden intense chest pressure and shortness of breath while singing in church. Electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes confirmed acute ST elevation MI. Laboratory tests indicated hyperlipidemia and elevated liver enzyme levels >4 times the upper normal limit (UNL). Day 40 post-MI, the patient returned to the hospital complaining of daily chest discomfort, atypical for angina pectoris. Following an unremarkable stress test result, the patient was encouraged to proceed with CR. Patient made regular progress through CR, although continued to experience paroxysmal chest discomfort away from CR, which he denied having during exercise. On day 75, his lipid profile met recommended targets while taking atorvastatin, but with liver enzymes >38 times UNL. Atorvastatin was discontinued at day 85, to which his enzymes responded appropriately, but by day 165, hyperlipidemia had returned. Rosuvastatin was started but was discontinued (day 197), with liver enzymes 6 times UNL. He continued CR without lipid therapy but at CR completion, the lipid panel did not meet targets. However, fitness and social indices improved significantly, although he occasionally still experienced chest pain, but with lesser frequency and intensity, and never with exercise. CONCLUSIONS: CR in a patient with SCT, MI, and statin-related hepatotoxicity requires several specific considerations. Although SCT-exercise associated deaths are described in the literature, this case suggests that such patients can benefit from CR and can exercise safely.",1
2606,7432433,Dose-response effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer,"We retrospectively analyzed the role of the dose level of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and in chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. There was a clear dose-response effect, indicating that CMF was useful only when given in a full or nearly full dose (greater than or equal to 85 per cent of the planned dose). Those given adjuvant therapy with 12 cycles of CMF at this dose level had a five-year relapse-free survival of 77 per cent, as compared with 45 per cent of patients treated only with radical mastectomy (P = 0.0001). In contrast, a subgroup receiving less than 65 per cent of the planned dose had a five-year survival without relapses of 48 per cent and a five-year survival with relapses of 67 per cent. These results are similar to those observed in a control group. With each dose level, the results at five years were influenced by the number of axillary lymph nodes involved but not by menopausal status. Our findings indicate that it is necessary to administer combination chemotherapy at a full dose to achieve clinical benefit.",0
2607,23738510,A congenital neutrophil defect syndrome associated with mutations in VPS45,"BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are the predominant phagocytes that provide protection against bacterial and fungal infections. Genetically determined neutrophil disorders confer a predisposition to severe infections and reveal novel mechanisms that control vesicular trafficking, hematopoiesis, and innate immunity. METHODS: We clinically evaluated seven children from five families who had neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, bone marrow fibrosis, and nephromegaly. To identify the causative gene, we performed homozygosity mapping using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, whole-exome sequencing, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, fibroblast motility assays, measurements of apoptosis, and zebrafish models. Correction experiments were performed by transfecting mutant fibroblasts with the nonmutated gene. RESULTS: All seven affected children had homozygous mutations (Thr224Asn or Glu238Lys, depending on the child's ethnic origin) in VPS45, which encodes a protein that regulates membrane trafficking through the endosomal system. The level of VPS45 protein was reduced, as were the VPS45 binding partners rabenosyn-5 and syntaxin-16. The level of ?1 integrin was reduced on the surface of VPS45-deficient neutrophils and fibroblasts. VPS45-deficient fibroblasts were characterized by impaired motility and increased apoptosis. A zebrafish model of vps45 deficiency showed a marked paucity of myeloperoxidase-positive cells (i.e., neutrophils). Transfection of patient cells with nonmutated VPS45 corrected the migration defect and decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Defective endosomal intracellular protein trafficking due to biallelic mutations in VPS45 underlies a new immunodeficiency syndrome involving impaired neutrophil function.

2608,9695991,Effects of long-term ursodeoxycholate administration on expression levels of secretory low-molecular-weight phospholipases A2 and mucin genes in gallbladders and biliary composition in patients with multiple cholesterol stones,"Group IIA phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a secretory low-molecular-weight PLA2, may play a critical role in the process of gallbladder mucosal inflammation in multiple cholesterol stones, which in turn may produce biliary pronucleating proteins as well as mucin. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholate (UDC) decreases biliary levels of various pronucleating proteins, possibly because of its membrane-protective effects on the inflamed gallbladder mucosa. To elucidate that beneficial effect of UDC, the expression levels of low-molecular-weight PLA2s, group IIA PLA2 (PLA2-IIA), and group V PLA2 (PLA2-V), and mucin core polypeptide genes in the gallbladders were studied for UDC-treated patients and untreated patients with multiple cholesterol stones. Furthermore, the results were correlated with alterations in biliary composition. With long-term administration of UDC, the PLA2-IIA protein mass (2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.4 ng/mg x protein [mean +/- SEM]; P < .01) and steady-state mRNA level, as well as the PLA2-V mRNA level, were significantly decreased in the gallbladders, where the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level was concomitantly decreased (190.7 +/- 27.9 vs. 393.6 +/- 55.3 pg/mg x protein; P < .01). In the gallbladder bile, the immunoradiometrically determined PLA2-IIA levels were significantly decreased in the UDC-treated patients (43 +/- 4 ng/dL; P < .01) in comparison with untreated patients (78 +/- 6 ng/dL). Significant decreases were similarly found for total protein, mucin, and free arachidonate concentrations, as well as nucleation activity in the bile. The degree of the changes was found to be rather small in solitary stones. In contrast to the decreased mucin concentration, however, there were no significant changes in the expression levels of mucin core polypeptide genes (MUC1-MUC6) between the UDC-treated and untreated patients. Long-term UDC administration was observed to lower the increased PLA2-IIA protein mass and mRNA level, as well as the PLA2-V mRNA level, in the gallbladders of patients with multiple cholesterol stones, which in turn may be of therapeutic importance in improving the gallbladder mucosal inflammation. Effects of UDC on secretory low-molecular-weight PLA2s as inflammatory mediators may relate to the reported efficacy of UDC treatment in cholesterol gallstone disease.",0
2609,7927240,Heat shock response in the liver: expression and regulation of the hsp70 gene family and early response genes after in vivo hyperthermia,"Heat shock response in cultured cells has been studied extensively; however few data are available on heat shock response in an intact organ of a living animal. In this study we analyzed the kinetics of expression of the heat shock protein 70 gene family (heat shock protein 70, heat shock cognate protein 73 and glucose-regulated protein 78) in the liver of the thermally stressed rat. New synthesis of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 73 was shown in liver slices pulse labeled in vitro with 35S-methionine. Accumulation of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 73 proteins was shown in total cellular extracts. 32P-labeled complementary DNA probes encoding heat shock protein 70, heat shock cognate protein 73 and glucose-regulated protein 78 were used to show that the levels of the corresponding messenger RNAs increase as a fraction of total RNA and in polysomes at different extents and with different kinetics. The induction of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 73 messenger RNAs reflected the increase in the synthesis of the corresponding proteins. Run-on transcription analysis indicated that the expression of heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 73 genes was mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. On the contrary, both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms can explain the induction of the glucose-regulated protein 78 gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
2610,8985275,Alcoholism and alcoholic organ damage and genetic polymorphisms of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in Chinese patients,"It is still not clear why some alcoholic patients acquire certain organ-specific complications of alcoholism whereas other alcoholic patients acquire different ones. As we know the liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and cytochrome P4502E1 (P4502E1) are polymorphic at the ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 loci and the 5'-flanking region of the P4502E1. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between Chinese alcoholic patients with cirrhosis and acute pancreatitis by studying the genetic polymorphisms of ADH2, ADH3, ALDH2, and P4502E1. Genotyping of ADH2, ADH3, ALDH2, and P4502E1 was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods on peripheral white blood cell DNA from 75 alcoholic cirrhotic patients, 48 acute alcoholic pancreatitis patients, 19 heavy drinkers without liver disease or pancreatitis, and 235 controls. The results showed that the frequencies of the alleles ADH2*1 and ALDH2*1 in the alcoholic cirrhotic patients were significantly higher than those in the nonalcoholic controls. In acute alcoholic pancreatitis patients, only the frequency of allele ALDH2*1, not ADH2*1 was significantly higher than in the nonalcoholic controls. The allele frequency of ADH2*1 in acute pancreatitis patients was significantly lower (P < .01) than in alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The daily amount of alcohol consumption was significantly lower in patients with acute pancreatitis than in patients with cirrhosis (P < .0005). The genotype distributions of P4502E1, detected by RsaI and PstI, were not different among alcoholic cirrhotic patients, alcoholic pancreatitis patients, heavy drinker, and nonalcoholic controls. In conclusion, ALDH2*1 is the most important alcohol metabolizing gene affecting predisposition to alcoholism whereas the ADH2*2 gene may influence susceptibility to acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis and with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis are of two different subpopulations.",0
2611,10423607,The prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 and the new drug development process,"The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) authorizes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to levy user fees on manufacturers who submit applications to the agency. Revenues are dedicated to the achievement of a set of specific performance goals, documented by the FDA Commissioner and referenced in the Act. The FDA currently credits PDUFA with the agency's success in reducing new drug review times and eliminating the formidable new drug application (NDA) backlog. To provide an independent assessment of PDUFA's impact on the new drug development process, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development established an annual user fee survey of over 50 major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with operations in the United States. As of December 31, 1996, survey data have been collected for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. Data from a cohort of user fee drugs approved in 1993-1996 were compared with data from all non-user fee drugs approved in 1990-1992. Whereas the mean approval phase (NDA submission to approval) for the user fee drugs was considerably shorter than that for the non-user fee drugs (14.5 versus 31.0 months, respectively), the mean clinical phase (investigational new drug application filing to NDA submission) was somewhat longer (88.0 versus 81.1 months, respectively). As a result, the total time from the start of clinical testing to drug approval (total phase) was only marginally shorter for the user fee drugs (102.0 versus 112.1 months, respectively). These results highlight the need for efforts to reduce lengthy drug development times. ",0
2612,21418672,Constipation in adults,"INTRODUCTION: Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and depend in part on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, bulk-forming laxatives, faecal softeners, stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, prostaglandin derivatives, and 5-HT4 agonists in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 51systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerol/glycerine suppositories, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, lubiprostone, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, prucalopride, and sterculia.",1
2613,26324739,"FDA Approval: Palbociclib for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Patients with Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer","""On February 3, 2015, the FDA granted accelerated approval to palbociclib (IBRANCE, Pfizer Inc.), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), for use in combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy for their metastatic disease. The approval is based on a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase I/II trial (PALOMA-1) in 165 patients randomized to palbociclib (125 mg orally daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off treatment) plus letrozole (2.5 mg orally daily) or letrozole alone. The phase II portion of the trial was divided into two cohorts: cohort 1 enrolled 66 biomarker-unselected patients and cohort 2 enrolled 99 biomarker-positive patients. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). A large magnitude of improvement in PFS was observed in patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole compared with patients receiving letrozole alone (HR, 0.488; 95% confidence interval, 0.319-0.748). Multiple sensitivity analyses were supportive of clinical benefit. The most common adverse reaction in patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was neutropenia. This article summarizes the FDA thought process and data supporting accelerated approval based on PALOMA-1 that may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the ongoing and fully accrued confirmatory trial PALOMA-2.""",1
2614,25199060,Oral glucocorticoid-sparing effect of mepolizumab in eosinophilic asthma,"""BACKGROUND: Many patients with severe asthma require regular treatment with oral glucocorticoids despite the use of high-dose inhaled therapy. However, the regular use of systemic glucocorticoids can result in serious and often irreversible adverse effects. Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 135 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, we compared the glucocorticoid-sparing effect of mepolizumab (at a dose of 100 mg) with that of placebo administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in the glucocorticoid dose (90 to 100% reduction, 75 to less than 90% reduction, 50 to less than 75% reduction, more than 0 to less than 50% reduction, or no decrease in oral glucocorticoid dose, a lack of asthma control during weeks 20 to 24, or withdrawal from treatment). Other outcomes included the rate of asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and safety. RESULTS: The likelihood of a reduction in the glucocorticoid-dose stratum was 2.39 times greater in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 4.56; P=0.008). The median percentage reduction from baseline in the glucocorticoid dose was 50% in the mepolizumab group, as compared with no reduction in the placebo group (P=0.007). Despite receiving a reduced glucocorticoid dose, patients in the mepolizumab group, as compared with those in the placebo group, had a relative reduction of 32% in the annualized rate of exacerbations (1.44 vs. 2.12, P=0.04) and a reduction of 0.52 points with respect to asthma symptoms (P=0.004), as measured on the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 (in which the minimal clinically important difference is 0.5 points). The safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients requiring daily oral glucocorticoid therapy to maintain asthma control, mepolizumab had a significant glucocorticoid-sparing effect, reduced exacerbations, and improved control of asthma symptoms.

2615,7575712,Light and electron microscopic analysis of sequential liver biopsy samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving long-term methotrexate therapy. Followup over long treatment intervals and correlation with clinical and laboratory variables,"OBJECTIVE: To describe liver histopathologic features and ultrastructural changes in a prospectively studied cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving long-term methotrexate (MTX) therapy, and to seek correlations between these changes and simultaneously measured laboratory indices of liver function. METHODS: This was a long-term, prospective, open observational study. Twenty-seven outpatients with RA who began therapy with MTX and continued treatment for extended periods underwent baseline and followup liver biopsies. One hundred seventy liver biopsy specimens were analyzed by light microscopy (LM) and assessed according to a modified Roenigk score and a newly devised numerical grading system. Ninety-three biopsy specimens were also analyzed by electron microscopy (EM). Blood samples were obtained at 4-6-week intervals for determination of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and albumin levels, and the weekly dosage of MTX was adjusted if there were abnormalities in the AST or albumin level. A mean of 6.3 liver biopsies per patient were obtained over a mean followup period of 8.2 years (range 2-13 years). RESULTS: The modified Roenigk score was significantly different from baseline at year 3, when it increased from a mean of 1.8 to 2.3 (P = 0.05) and at year 6, when it increased to 2.4 (P = 0.04), but this was not considered clinically meaningful. No other significant changes from baseline were observed by either LM grading system. No significant progression was observed by EM over the course of the investigation. Increases in serial measurements of AST correlated with both the modified Roenigk score (r = 0.21, P = 0.016) and the numerical rating score (r = 0.19, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Patients with RA who are receiving weekly single-dose oral MTX therapy exhibit little deterioration in hepatic architecture by LM or EM when the dosage of the drug is adjusted for abnormalities in AST and serum albumin, monitored at frequent intervals.",1

2617,25691510,Impact of a pharmacoinvasive strategy when delays to primary PCI are prolonged,"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) is the preferred reperfusion option in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, but its benefits become attenuated as time to its potential delivery becomes prolonged. Based on the STrategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial, we assessed the impact of increasing time delay on outcomes in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy (PI) or P-PCI. Thirty-day clinical outcomes were examined according to PCI-related delay (P-RD). Data from hospitals that enrolled >10 randomised patients were used and P-RD categorised as ≤55 min, >55-97 min and >97 min. Composite of death/congestive heart failure/cardiogenic shock/myocardial infarction in PI and P-PCI arms occurred in 10.6% versus 10.3% (≤55 min, p=0.910); 13.9% versus 17.9% (>55-97 min, p=0.148) and 13.5% versus 16.2% (>97 min, p=0.470), respectively. While there was no worsening of outcomes for PI across the P-RD spectrum, this occurred in the P-PCI arm (p(trend)=0.038). For P-RD ≤55 min, fewer events tended to occur with P-PCI than PI. Conversely, as P-RD increased to >55 min, PI-assigned patients had better outcomes than P-PCI, suggesting an event-free advantage with PI as P-RD increased (p(interaction)=0.094). Analysing P-RD continuously showed that for every 10-min increment there was an increasing trend towards benefit among PI-assigned patients (p(interaction)=0.073). As P-RD increased, PI outcomes became superior to P-PCI when P-RD is prolonged and exceeds guideline-mandated times. In such circumstances, a PI strategy may provide an alternative reperfusion option. Adverse time delays for delivery of P-PCI should be considered when evaluating reperfusion strategies. NCT00623623.

2618,7673152,p21ras as a common signaling target of reactive free radicals and cellular redox stress,"Reactive free radicals have been implicated in mediating signal transduction by a variety of stimuli. We have investigated the role of p21ras in mediating free radical signaling. Our studies revealed that signaling by oxidative agents which modulate cellular redox status, such as H2O2, hemin, Hg2+, and nitric oxide was prevented in cells in which p21ras activity was blocked either through expression of a dominant negative mutant or by treating with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, as assessed by NF-kappa B binding activity. Furthermore, the NF-kappa B response to these oxidative stress stimuli was found to be enhanced when cells from the human T cell line, Jurkat, were pretreated with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis. We directly assayed p21ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase activities in Jurkat cells and found both of these signaling molecules to be activated in cells treated with the redox modulating agents. Blocking glutathione synthesis made cells 10- to 100-fold more sensitive to these agents. Finally, using recombinant p21ras in vitro, we found that redox modulators directly promoted guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras. This study suggests that direct activation of p21ras may be a central mechanism by which a variety of redox stress stimuli transmit their signal to the nucleus. ",0
2619,12501221,Influenza-related hospitalizations among children in Hong Kong,"BACKGROUND: It has been difficult to define the burden of influenza in children because of confounding by the cocirculation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In Hong Kong, China, the influenza and RSV infection seasons sometimes do not overlap, thus providing an opportunity to estimate the rate of influenza-related hospitalization in a defined population, free from the effects of RSV. METHODS: In a retrospective, population-based study, we estimated the influenza-associated excess rate of hospitalization among children 15 years old or younger in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from 1997 to 1999. Data from a single hospital with intensive use of virologic analyses for diagnosis were obtained to define and adjust for underestimation of the model. RESULTS: Peaks of influenza and RSV infection activity were well separated in 1998 and 1999 but overlapped in 1997. The adjusted rates of excess hospitalization for acute respiratory disease that were attributable to influenza were 278.5 and 288.2 per 10,000 children less than 1 year of age in 1998 and 1999, respectively; 218.4 and 209.3 per 10,000 children 1 to less than 2 years of age; 125.6 and 77.3 per 10,000 children 2 to less than 5 years of age; 57.3 and 20.9 per 10,000 children 5 to less than 10 years of age; and 16.4 and 8.1 per 10,000 children 10 to 15 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In the subtropics, influenza is an important cause of hospitalization among children, with rates exceeding those reported for temperate regions.",0
2620,9017942,Racial variation in the use of coronary-revascularization procedures. Are the differences real? Do they matter?,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that blacks undergo fewer coronary-revascularization procedures than whites, but it is not clear whether the clinical characteristics of the patients account for these differences or whether they indicate underuse of the procedures in blacks or overuse in whites. METHODS: In a study at Duke University of 12,402 patients (10.3 percent of whom were black) with coronary disease, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted rates of angioplasty and bypass surgery in blacks and whites after cardiac catheterization. We also examined patterns of treatment after stratifying the patients according to the severity of disease, angina status, and estimated survival benefit due to revascularization. Finally, we compared five-year survival rates in blacks and whites. RESULTS: After adjustment for the severity of disease and other characteristics, blacks were 13 percent less likely than whites to undergo angioplasty and 32 percent less likely to undergo bypass surgery. The adjusted black:white odds ratios for receiving these procedures were 0.87 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.03) and 0.68 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.82), respectively. The racial differences in rates of bypass surgery persisted among those with severe anginal symptoms (31 percent of blacks underwent surgery, vs. 45 percent of whites, P<0.001) and among those predicted to have the greatest survival benefit from revascularization (42 percent vs. 61 percent, P<0.001). Finally, unadjusted and adjusted rates of survival for five years were significantly lower in blacks than in whites. CONCLUSIONS: Blacks with coronary disease were significantly less likely than whites to undergo coronary revascularization, particularly bypass surgery - a difference that could not be explained by the clinical features of their disease. The differences in treatment were most pronounced among those predicted to benefit the most from revascularization. Since these differences also correlated with a lower survival rate in blacks, we conclude that coronary revascularization appears to be underused in blacks.",0
2621,7469629,Acetaminophen overdose. 662 cases with evaluation of oral acetylcysteine treatment,"Six hundred sixty-two consecutive patients with acetaminophen overdoses were evaluated. Those at risk on the basis of their acetaminophen blood levels, as plotted on the study nomogram, were treated with oral acetylcysteine. Statistically significant differences in severity of hepatic toxicity were observed between patients treated within 16 hours after ingestion and those treated between 16 and 24 hours after ingestion. No deaths occurred among patients treated within 24 hours of ingestion, except for one patient who was an alleged gunshot homicide. Seven percent of patients with plasma acetaminophen levels in the potentially toxic range and treated with acetylcysteine within ten hours of ingestion showed transient SGOT level elevations, whereas 29% of those treated between ten and 16 hours after ingestion and 62% of those treated between 16 and 24 hours after ingestion showed such transient toxicity. No consistent difference in hepatotoxicity could be demonstrated between those patients with a history of chronic alcohol use and those patients with no history of chronic alcohol use. Acute alcohol use resulted in less severe toxic reactions than in those patients without acute alcohol use.",1
2622,28948396,"Breast cancer recurrence, bone metastases, and visceral metastases in women with stage II and III breast cancer in Denmark","We developed and validated algorithms to identify metastases and breast cancer recurrence in Danish medical registries. We computed the incidence rate (IR) and hazard ratios (HRs) to evaluate predictors of these outcomes in stage II/III breast cancer patients. We included all women in Denmark diagnosed during 1999-2011 with regional or stage II/III breast cancer. Demographic, tumor, and treatment data were ascertained from population-based health registries. To facilitate diagnostic work-up of the primary cancer, follow-up began 180 days after diagnosis and continued until recurrence/metastases, death, or 31 December 2012, whichever occurred first. We computed the positive predictive values (PPVs) of recurrence, bone metastases, and visceral metastases using medical records as a gold standard. We calculated the cumulative incidence, IR per 10,000 person years, and used Cox regression to compute the HRs and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Among 23,478 patients, 7073 had regional stage and 16,405 had stage II/III breast cancer. The PPV for recurrence was 72.6% (95% CI 59.3, 83.3%). The PPVs for bone and visceral metastases were 92.3% (95% CI 69.3-99.2%) and 70.8% (95% CI 51.1, 85.9%), but had low sensitivity. Five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence, bone metastases, and visceral metastases were 18.4, 2.2, and 5.2%, with corresponding 5-year IRs of 540 (95% CI 524, 557), 60 (95% CI 55, 65), and 144 (95% CI 136, 152), respectively. Predictors of recurrence and metastases included age, stage, hormone receptor status, and cancer treatment. Our algorithms show moderate to high PPVs for recurrence and metastases. The IRs of metastases were lower compared with other registry-based cohort studies, so may be underestimated in Danish registries. ",0
2623,20034049,Increased caffeine consumption is associated with reduced hepatic fibrosis,"Although coffee consumption has been associated with reduced frequency of liver disease, it is unclear whether the effect is from coffee or caffeine and whether there is an effect on hepatic fibrosis specifically. This study was undertaken to use a food-frequency instrument for dietary caffeine consumption to evaluate the relationship between caffeine intake and liver fibrosis. Patients undergoing liver biopsy completed a detailed caffeine questionnaire on three occasions over a 6-month period. Caffeine intake was compared between patients with mild and advanced liver fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between caffeine consumption and hepatic fibrosis. One hundred seventy-seven patients (99 male, 104 white, 121 with chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection) undergoing liver biopsy completed the caffeine questionnaire on up to three occasions. Results from repeated questionnaires were consistent. Daily caffeine consumption above the 75(th) percentile for the cohort (308 mg = approximately 2.25 cups of coffee equivalents) was associated with reduced liver fibrosis (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.80; P = 0.015) and the protective association persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, liver disease, body mass index, and alcohol intake in all patients (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.67; P = 0.006), as well as the subset with HCV infection (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.66; P = 0.009). Despite a modest trend, consumption of caffeine from sources other than coffee or of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with reduced liver fibrosis. A reliable tool for measurement of caffeine consumption demonstrated that caffeine consumption, particularly from regular coffee, above a threshold of approximately 2 coffee-cup equivalents per day, was associated with less severe hepatic fibrosis.",0
2624,2189950,Postoperative chemotherapy and tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone in the treatment of positive-node breast cancer patients aged 50 years and older with tumors responsive to tamoxifen: results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-16,"""The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether tamoxifen (TAM) plus chemotherapy is more effective than TAM alone in improving disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival (S) of positive-node, TAM-responsive patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years. Women were randomized among three treatment groups: (1) TAM alone, (2) Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, and TAM (ACT), or (3) melphalan (L-PAM), fluorouracil (5-FU), and TAM (PFT). The PFT arm was later modified so that new patients also received Adriamycin (PAFT). Findings from 1,124 eligible patients through 3 years of follow-up indicated a significantly better DFS for ACT-treated patients than for those receiving TAM alone (84% v 67%; P = .0004). An advantage in DDFS and S was also observed after ACT therapy (83% v 73% [P = .04 in the former] and 93% v 85% [P = .04 in the latter]). Both the DFS and DDFS of PAFT-treated patients were better than in those treated by TAM alone (83% v 66%, P = .0002 and 85% v 73%, P = .003). PFT patients also fared better in DFS and DDFS than TAM patients (81% v 72%, P = .07 and 85% v 74%, P = .02). Odds ratios consistently favored the three TAM-plus-chemotherapy groups. No significant S advantage is as yet evident in favor of the PAFT or PFT groups. Of importance is the failure of these studies to demonstrate an unfavorable interaction between the drug regimens used and the TAM, which was administered simultaneously. The findings related to the use of PAFT and PFT are of more biologic than clinical significance since L-PAM is rarely used in the treatment of breast cancer. The major conclusion from this study is the observance of a better outcome in positive-node breast cancer patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years from the use of postoperative prolonged TAM and short-course AC therapy (completed in 63 days) than from prolonged TAM therapy alone.""",1
2625,24072837,Paradoxical air embolism following central venous catheter removal,Central venous catheters are commonly used in the management of critically ill patients. This case report described a rare but potentially fatal complication of central venous catheter use. A 52-year-old man underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement for infective endocarditis. On day 8 postoperatively he accidentally removed his catheter and collapsed with symptoms and signs suggestive of a cerebral air embolism. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed air bubbles in both the right and left ventricles of the heart confirming the presence of a paradoxical air embolism.  ,0
2626,1988346,Specificity of the hepatocyte Na(+)-dependent taurocholate transporter: influence of side chain length and charge,"Trihydroxy bile acids with differing nonsterol chain length and charge were synthesized to define the effect of these parameters on the ability to competitively inhibit the Na(+)-dependent uptake of 14C taurocholate into isolated rat hepatocytes. Compounds with long side chains (greater than or equal to 0.8 nm) beyond carbon-17 of the sterol nucleus and carrying a negative charge or no charge were potent inhibitors. Introduction of a positive charge into the side chain weakened inhibition. When the length of the chain beyond carbon-17 fell below about 0.7 nm, charge still influenced inhibitory potency, but the effect was reversed and positively-charged chains yielded slightly greater inhibition than negatively-charged chains. From these results one may postulate a positively-charged cell surface domain extending outward from a point about 0.7 nm from the sterol nucleus receptor region. Up to about 0.7 nm from the sterol nucleus receptor region one might postulate a negative cell surface charge to account for the weaker inhibitory potency of compounds with short negatively-charged chains. Nonetheless, a short chain, regardless of charge, weakened inhibition, suggesting that a long negatively-charged side chain is necessary to orient the sterol moiety for optimal receptor fit. These data confirm that the Na(+)-dependent taurocholate transport site is sensitive to alterations of side chain charge and length and emphasize the importance of structure when designing bile acid analogs to probe taurocholate transport mechanisms.",0
2627,12653814,Buprenorphine versus methadone maintenance therapy: a randomized double-blind trial with 405 opioid-dependent patients,"AIMS: To assess the efficacy of buprenorphine compared with methadone maintenance therapy for opioid dependence in a large sample using a flexible dosing regime and the marketed buprenorphine tablet. DESIGN: Patients were randomized to receive buprenorphine or methadone over a 13-week treatment period in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. SETTING: Three methadone clinics in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and five opioid-dependent patients seeking treatment. INTERVENTION: Patients received buprenorphine or methadone as indicated clinically using a flexible dosage regime. During weeks 1-6, patients were dosed daily. From weeks 7-13, buprenorphine patients received double their week 6 dose on alternate days. MEASUREMENTS: Retention in treatment, and illicit opioid use as determined by urinalysis. Self-reported drug use, psychological functioning, HIV-risk behaviour, general health and subjective ratings were secondary outcomes. FINDINGS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no significant difference in completion rates at 13 weeks. Methadone was superior to buprenorphine in time to termination over the 13-week period (Wald chi 2 = 4.371, df = 1, P = 0.037), but not separately for the single-day or alternate-day dosing phases. There were no significant between-group differences in morphine-positive urines, or in self-reported heroin or other illicit drug use. The majority (85%) of the buprenorphine patients transferred to alternate-day dosing were maintained in alternate-day dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine did not differ from methadone in its ability to suppress heroin use, but retained approximately 10% fewer patients. This poorer retention was due possibly to too-slow induction onto buprenorphine. For the majority of patients, buprenorphine can be administered on alternate days.",1
2628,29887611,Effectiveness of outreach chest camps in detection of missed TB cases in Pakistan,"To determine the effectiveness of outreach chest camp intervention for detection of missed tuberculosis cases in Pakistan and to evaluate the demographic profile of those who are dependent on such doorstep healthcare services. This retrospective study was carried out using data from the outreach chest camp intervention organised by Greenstar Social Marketing company from August 2015 till December 2016 in Lahore, Gujrat and Sheikhupura districts of Pakistan's Punjab province. The intervention involved a set of community mobilisation events in hard-to-reach areas and in healthcare facilities which are deprived of suitable settings, followed by free medical camps where medical consultation and tuberculosis diagnostic facility of sputum smear microscopy were provided to the camp attendees. The data was taken as per set variables and analysed using SPSS 23. A total of 399chest camps were conducted, where 22,399 patients were clinically assessed for the presence or absence of tuberculosis. Overall, 12,319(55%) of the attendees were females and 10,080(45%) were males. Of the total, 5,226(24.6%) had signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and were declared as tuberculosis presumptive cases. After diagnostic investigations, 831(3.7%) individuals were declared confirmed tuberculosis patients. Amongst the total confirmed cases, 439(52.8%) were diagnosed through sputum smear microscopy with percent bacteria positivity of 8. (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.54 - 9.02). Chest camp intervention was found to have great potential to detect missed tuberculosis cases, thus limiting the spread of disease in the community. ",0
2629,28947438,"Medical leadership, a systematic narrative review: do hospitals and healthcare organisations perform better when led by doctors?","Despite common assumptions that doctors are well placed to lead hospitals and healthcare organisations, the peer-reviewed literature contains little evidence on the performance of doctors in leadership roles in comparison with that of non-medical managers. To determine whether there is an association between the leader's medical background and management performance in terms of organisational performance or patient outcomes. We searched for peer-reviewed, English language studies using Medline, Embase and Emerald Management between 2005 and 2017. We included quantitative, qualitative and mixed method empirical studies on the performance of senior healthcare managers where participants were described as doctors or leaders and where comparative performance data were provided on non-medical leaders. Studies without full text available, or no organisational, leadership behaviour or patient measures, were excluded. The search, conducted in Medline (n=3395), Embase (n=1913) and Emerald Management (n=454) databases, yielded 3926 entries. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 studies remained. Twelve studies found that there were positive differences between medical and non-medical leaders, and eight studies correlated those findings with hospital performance or patient outcomes. Six studies examined the composition of boards of directors; otherwise, there were few common areas of investigation. Five inter-related themes emerged from a narrative analysis: the impact of medical leadership on outcomes; doctors on boards; contribution of qualifications and experience; the medical leader as an individual or part of a team and doctors transitioning into the medical leadership role. A modest body of evidence supports the importance of including doctors on organisational governing boards. Despite many published articles on the topic of whether hospitals and healthcare organisations perform better when led by doctors, there were few empirical studies that directly compared the performance of medical and non-medical managers. This is an under-researched area that requires further funding and focus. ",0
2630,23307827,"Efficacy and safety of oral treprostinil monotherapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, controlled trial","""BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive, fatal disease with no cure. Parenteral and inhaled prostacyclin analogue therapies are effective for the treatment of PAH, but complicated administration requirements can limit the use of these therapies in patients with less severe disease. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the oral prostacyclin analogue treprostinil diolamine as initial treatment for de novo PAH. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-nine patients (intent-to-treat population) not receiving endothelin receptor antagonist or phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor background therapy were randomized (treprostinil, n=233; placebo, n=116). The primary analysis population (modified intent-to-treat) included 228 patients (treprostinil, n=151; placebo, n=77) with access to 0.25-mg treprostinil tablets at randomization. The primary end point was change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance at week 12. Secondary end points included Borg dyspnea index, clinical worsening, and symptoms of PAH. The week 12 treatment effect for 6-minute walk distance (modified intent-to-treat population) was 23.0 m (P=0.0125). For the intent-to-treat population, 6-minute walk distance improvements were observed at peak (26.0 m; P=0.0001) and trough (17.0 m; P=0.0025) plasma study drug concentrations. Other than an improvement in the combined 6-minute walk distance/Borg dyspnea score, there were no significant changes in secondary end points. Oral treprostinil therapy was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events (intent-to-treat) were headache (69%), nausea (39%), diarrhea (37%), and pain in jaw (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Oral treprostinil improves exercise capacity in PAH patients not receiving other treatment. Oral treprostinil could provide a convenient, first-line prostacyclin treatment option for PAH patients not requiring more intensive therapy.

2631,21194596,Acute hepatitis associated with the use of levofloxacin,"""BACKGROUND: Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone used globally to treat respiratory, skin, and genitourinary tract infections. It is generally well tolerated and there is a very low risk for liver injury in patients taking this antibiotic. OBJECTIVE: We report an acute case of hepatitis following treatment with levofloxacin for pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old white male (height, 162 cm; weight, 58 kg) with chronic bronchitis presented to the emergency department of the Hospital Curry Cabral, Lisbon, Portugal, with respiratory difficulty and productive cough. The patient had a history of chronic bronchitis, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was being treated with salmeterol 50 ?g plus fluticasone 250 ?g BID, and amlodipine 5 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, alfuzosin 10 mg, and finasteride 5 mg once daily. Initially, the patient refused admission and was sent home, medicated with levofloxacin 500 mg once daily (single dose) for pneumonia and acetaminophen 1 g (as needed, maximum TID) if axillary temperature exceeded 38.0?C (100.4?F). Three days later, the patient returned for a follow-up visit, and despite clinical and radiologic improvement, blood tests revealed a slight aggravation of anemia. On the seventh day of treatment with levofloxacin, the patient showed an elevation of transaminases. The temporal relation between the use of levofloxacin and the liver injury, the exclusion of other causes of hepatitis, and a compatible liver biopsy (conducted 14 days after identification of hepatitis) was consistent with the diagnosis of levofloxacin-associated hepatotoxicity. Levofloxacin treatment was stopped and the patient made a full recovery. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score for this association was """"probable"""" (score 7) and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method Scale score was """"highly probable"""" (score 9). Unlike the 5 reported cases in the literature, this is the only case in which both a liver biopsy was performed in the course of the disease and the patient survived. CONCLUSION: The acute hepatitis observed in this elderly patient was probably associated with the administration of levofloxacin.""",1
2632,3614286,Statistical problems in the reporting of clinical trials. A survey of three medical journals,"Reports of clinical trials often contain a wealth of data comparing treatments. This can lead to problems in interpretation, particularly when significance testing is used extensively. We examined 45 reports of comparative trials published in the British Medical Journal, the Lancet, or the New England Journal of Medicine to illustrate these statistical problems. The issues we considered included the analysis of multiple end points, the analysis of repeated measurements over time, subgroup analyses, trials of multiple treatments, and the overall number of significance tests in a trial report. Interpretation of large amounts of data is complicated by the common failure to specify in advance the intended size of a trial or statistical stopping rules for interim analyses. In addition, summaries or abstracts of trials tend to emphasize the more statistically significant end points. Overall, the reporting of clinical trials appears to be biased toward an exaggeration of treatment differences. Trials should have a clearer predefined policy for data analysis and reporting. In particular, a limited number of primary treatment comparisons should be specified in advance. The overuse of arbitrary significance levels (for example, P less than 0.05) is detrimental to good scientific reporting, and more emphasis should be given to the magnitude of treatment differences and to estimation methods such as confidence intervals.",0
2633,12939584,Novel differential gene expression in human cirrhosis detected by suppression subtractive hybridization,"Pathogenic molecular pathways in cirrhotic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are poorly characterized. Differentially expressed genes are often important in disease pathogenesis. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a genome-wide approach that enriches for differentially expressed mRNA transcripts. We aimed to make novel observations of differential gene expression in cirrhosis using SSH combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Liver transcriptomes in HCV cirrhosis, AIH cirrhosis, PBC, and nondiseased liver tissue were examined by SSH. Resulting complementary DNA (cDNA) clones were rescreened for differential expression by dot-blot hybridization and then sequenced. Selected gene expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Following SSH, 694 clones were rescreened for differential gene expression, of which 145 were sequenced and found to derive from 89 different genes. Seven clones were homologous only with expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences encoding genes having no known function. Up-regulated expression of four genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR: transmembrane 4 superfamily member 3 (tetraspanin CO-029) in all forms of cirrhosis, hedgehog interacting protein (HIP) in AIH cirrhosis and chitinase 3-like-1 (HC gp-39 or ykl-40) and arginine-glutamic acid repeat (RERE) in HCV cirrhosis. RERE gene polymorphisms and splice variants were observed in all tissues examined. Tetraspanin CO-029 up-regulation was primarily localized to bile ductular cells. In conclusion, novel observations of differential gene expression in human cirrhosis were made using SSH as the primary discovery tool. In particular, further studies of the RERE gene and its products in HCV associated liver disease are warranted.",0
2634,458490,Toxicity of rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol in weanling mice,"Reinvestigation of the previously reported toxicity of saturated fat on weanling mice has shown rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol to be a more potent toxic agent than free palmitic acid when fed as the sole source of dietary fat. As shown before, protection against this toxicity can be afforded by the addition of 2 to 4% safflower oil. We have now shown that if the rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol is acetylated the toxicity is much less. The protective effect of diacetyl rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol cannot be totally ascribed either to the presence of acetate itself or to the blocking of the free hydroxyls of palmitoyl glycerol by acylation. In vivo absorption studies coupled with in vitro experiments with pancreatic lipase suggest that the major protective effects result from increased lipolysis of the acylated palmitoyl glycerol, causing conversion to the less toxic free palmitic acid.

To examine the efficacy and safety of the selected darunavir/r dose further, additional patients were analyzed. METHODS: Treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients received darunavir/r at a dose of 600/100 mg twice daily plus an optimized background regimen. The primary intent-to-treat analysis was the proportion of patients with an HIV-1 RNA reduction >or=1 log10 at week 24. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-seven patients were treated; the baseline mean HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies/mL, and the median CD4 count was 115 cells/mm3 (median primary PI mutations = 3, PI resistance-associated mutations = 9). Two hundred forty-six patients reached week 24 by the cutoff date and were included in the efficacy analysis: 65% and 40% achieved HIV-1 RNA reductions of >or=1 log10 and <50 copies/mL, respectively, at week 24. The mean CD4 count increase was 80 cells/mm3. The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (14%), nasopharyngitis (11%), and nausea (10%). Nine (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of AEs or HIV-1-related events. Six treatment-unrelated deaths (2%) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate POWER 1 and POWER 2. In this larger set of treatment-experienced patients, darunavir/r at a dose of 600/100 mg twice daily provided substantial virologic and immunologic responses and was generally safe and well tolerated.""",1
2636,29192408,Prolonged delivery of BMP-2 by a non-polymer hydrogel for bone defect regeneration,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is a potent inducer of bone formation that is currently used in a limited number of clinical indications to treat extensive bone loss. Extending the field of applications of this molecule requires design of the delivery system to protect the protein from early degradation and allow a slow long-term release. This study describes the use of a non-polymer hydrogel, based on the self-assembly of small amphiphilic glycosyl-nucleolipids into micellar structures, as a new type of delivery system for BMP-2. BMP-2 was readily encapsulated in glycosyl-nucleosyl-fluorinated (GNF)-based gels and slowly released in vitro, while maintaining its osteogenic activity. When hydrogel pieces containing fluorophore-tagged BMP-2 were deposited onto a calvaria defect in mouse, the signal detected in living mice gradually decreased and was still detectable at 3 weeks. Gel-embedded protein promoted significant calvarial bone defect regeneration at 8 weeks after surgery. In contrast, when a solution of BMP-2 without hydrogel was injected into the defects, the fluorescence signal decreased rapidly and no significant bone formation was observed. The unique property of the GNF-based hydrogel as an injectable delivery system for low doses of BMP-2 was revealed in a subcutaneous model of ectopic bone formation. Injected BMP-2-laden GNF hydrogel blocks elicited the formation of cancellous bone, showing all the typical features of remodeling bone that contains bone marrow. These results show that this GNF-based hydrogel is an easy-to-use, efficient delivery system for BMP-2 and osteogenic material to support bone regeneration. ",0
2637,6350877,The infant seat as treatment for gastroesophageal reflux,"""Positioning in the infant seat (""""chalasia chair"""") for treatment of infants with gastroesophageal reflux is presumed to have a beneficial effect. We undertook a controlled, prospective study of such positioning to evaluate this purported benefit. Nine infants with documented gastroesophageal reflux participated in 18 paired two-hour postprandial trials in an infant seat and in the horizontal prone position. Distal esophageal pH monitoring demonstrated longer exposure to gastroesophageal reflux while infants were in the seat than when they were prone (28.2 +/- 6.4 per cent vs. 12.8 +/- 3.7 per cent of total time with pH less than 4.0, P = 0.023), a difference due largely to more episodes (16.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.1 +/- 2.3 per two-hour postprandial period, P = 0.002). We conclude that the infant seat, rather than being therapeutic in gastroesophageal reflux in children under six months of age, is actually detrimental, when compared with simply placing an infant prone.""",0

METHODS: In this phase 2, open-label study, we assessed treatment with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir, the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4. Cohort A enrolled patients with cirrhosis and moderate or severe hepatic impairment who had not undergone liver transplantation. Cohort B enrolled patients who had undergone liver transplantation: those without cirrhosis; those with cirrhosis and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; and those with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 12 or 24 weeks of a fixed-dose combination tablet containing ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, once daily, plus ribavirin. The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). RESULTS: We enrolled 337 patients, 332 (99%) with HCV genotype 1 infection and 5 (1%) with HCV genotype 4 infection. In cohort A (nontransplant), SVR12 was achieved by 86%-89% of patients. In cohort B (transplant recipients), SVR12 was achieved by 96%-98% of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, by 85%-88% of patients with moderate hepatic impairment, by 60%-75% of patients with severe hepatic impairment, and by all 6 patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Response rates in the 12-�and 24-week groups were similar. Thirteen patients (4%) discontinued the ledipasvir and sofosbuvir combination prematurely because of adverse events; 10 patients died, mainly from complications related to hepatic decompensation. CONCLUSION: The combination of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and�ribavirin for 12 weeks produced high rates of SVR12 in patients with advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis before and after liver transplantation.

2640,31387576,Oncologic outcome of marginal mandibulectomy in squamous cell carcinoma of the lower gingiva,"There is a large amount of controversy about the best management of the mandible in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), mainly owing to the inability to acquire accurate bone invasion status. Therefore, our goal was to analyse the oncologic safety in patients undergoing marginal mandibulectomy (MM) for cT1-2 N0 SCC of the lower gingiva. Patients undergoing MM for untreated cT1-2 N0 SCC of the lower gingiva were retrospectively enrolled. The main endpoints of interest were locoregional control (LRC) and disease-specific survival (DSS). A total of 142 patients were included in the analysis, and a pathologic positive node was noted in 27 patients. Cortical invasion was reported in 23 patients, and medullary invasion was reported in 9 patients. The 5-year LRC and DSS rates were 85 and 88%, respectively. Patients with bone invasion had a significantly higher risk for recurrence than patients without bone invasion. However, the DSS was similar in patients with versus without bone invasion. Patients with a high neutrophil lymphocyte ratio had a higher risk for worse prognosis. The oncologic outcome in patients undergoing MM for cT1-2 N0 SCC of the lower gingiva was favourable; bone invasion was not uncommon, but it significantly decreased the prognosis in patients undergoing MM.

This retrospective study included 69 and 26 patients in the PRN and 3 monthly initial dose groups, respectively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were compared between the 2 groups 6 months after initial injection. At month 6, BCVA change from baseline was -0.27 ± 0.28 (mean ± standard deviation) logMAR in the PRN group and -0.28 ± 0.20 logMAR in the 3 monthly initial dose group. Mean CRT changes were -204 ± 168 in the PRN group and -161 ± 149  μ m in the 3 monthly initial dose group at month 6. There were no statistically significant differences in BCVA or CRT changes between groups at any time point. The number of intravitreal injections over 6 months was significantly lower in the PRN group (1.8 ± 0.8 injections) than in the 3 monthly initial dose group (3.4 ± 0.5 injections; P < 0.001). Our results suggest that as-needed intravitreal bevacizumab injections are more tolerable for patients with ME secondary to BRVO. ",0
2642,22956473,Efficacy and safety of voriconazole in the treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis: experience in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Though various clinical conditions of aspergillosis can occur, depending essentially on the host's immunological status, the focus of research in North American and European countries has mainly been on invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. There are, however, also many problems to overcome in chronic forms of aspergillosis. One of those problems is that there are no codified treatment guidelines for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). Especially in Japan, this issue is more serious, because there are more cases with CPA due to the many aged people with past history of tuberculosis. Several clinical cases and case series have reported the usefulness of the various antifungal agents that are available. The new triazole, voriconazole, in particular, seems to be effective in the treatment of CPA. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of voriconazole in the treatment of CPA in non-immunocompromised patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study over a 2-year period. For inclusion in the study, patients with confirmed or probable CPA were recruited in 11 hospitals of the National Hospital Organization in Japan. Clinical, radiological, serological, and mycological data were collected at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment or at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Among 77 patients enrolled in the study, 71 patients (mean age 65.9 years, 56 males and 15 females) were eligible for the study. All of the eligible patients presented with underlying lung diseases, including sequelae of tuberculosis (n = 35), non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (n = 8), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 8), interstitial pneumonia (n = 7), cystic lung disease (n = 4), pneumothorax (n = 3), bronchial cancer (n = 1), and others (n = 5). Voriconazole was indicated in 48 cases (68 %) as the first-line treatment for CPA and 23 patients previously received other antifungal therapies. Based on a composite of clinical, radiologic, serological, and mycologic criteria, good response was seen in 43 patients (60.6 %), no response was observed in 19 patients (26.8 %), and 4 cases (5.6 %) got worse. Five patients (7.0 %) were unassessable for efficacy. The common adverse events were visual disturbances (17 patients, 23.9 %), abnormal liver function test results (12 patients, 16.9 %), adverse psychological effects (3 patients, 4.2 %), and others (10 patients, 14.0 %). Treatment with voriconazole had to be stopped in 2 cases (2.8 %) because of serious adverse events (abnormal liver function test results). There was no association between adverse effects and trough voriconazole levels in serum. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, voriconazole provides effective therapy of CPA in non-immunocompromised patients with an acceptable level of toxicity.",1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of levocetirizine in improving symptoms and health-related quality of life in US adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind trial randomized adults with SAR, sensitized to at least 1 grass allergen, to receive levocetirizine, 5 mg, or placebo once daily in the evening for 2 weeks. The primary end point was the 24-hour reflective Total 5-Symptom Score (T5SS; sum of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal and ocular pruritus) during the entire treatment period. Secondary assessments included the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Allergy Specific (WPAI-AS) questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), each assessed at week 1, week 2, and the end of treatment. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population comprised 287 patients taking levocetirizine and 290 taking placebo, with no significant between-group differences at baseline. Levocetirizine resulted in significantly greater improvement from baseline vs placebo in the T5SS (P < .001), overall RQLQ score (P < .001), general and work-related WPAI-AS subscores (P < .05), and ESS score (P < .001). Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 14.4% for levocetirizine and 18.4% for placebo. The incidence of somnolence and fatigue was 0.7% and 1.8% with levocetirizine and 1.0% and 0% with placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Levocetirizine was well tolerated and was significantly more effective than placebo in improving the naso-ocular symptoms and health-related quality of life in US patients with SAR.""",1
2644,1528093,The analgesic effect of subarachnoid administration of tetracaine combined with low dose morphine or nalbuphine for spinal anesthesia],"The analgesic effect of subarachnoid administration of tetracaine combined with low dose morphine or nalbuphine for spinal anesthesia was evaluated in 60 ASA physical status class I or II patients. Dextrose solution (10%) was added to 0.4 mg morphine or 0.4 mg nalbuphine to make a total volume of 2 ml, which was injected intrathecally with tetracaine in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Vital signs, sensory level, motor block, pain score, and side effects were recorded every 2 min for the first 15 min and then at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and at 30-min intervals until the patient complained of pain. Side effects and opioid requirements were recorded for the first 24 h. Complete analgesia (time from injection to first report of pain) lasted 180 +/- 51.6 min in the control group and increased to 238 +/- 71 min in group with addition of 0.4 mg nalbuphine, 250 +/- 74 min in group with addition of 0.4 mg morphine (p less than 0.05). The effective analgesia (time from injection to first opioid requirement) also increased in groups of nalbuphine and morphine than the control group. No differences in complete or effective analgesia was found between groups in the presence of nalbuphine or morphine. Results indicate that the addition of 0.4 mg nalbuphine or morphine to hyperbaric tetracaine for spinal anesthesia improves the quality of intraoperative analgesia and can last into the postoperative period. Side effects were less in nalbuphine group than with morphine group. ",0
2645,1446898,Hemodynamic effects of calibrated stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery in conscious rats with portal vein stenosis,"Because superior mesenteric arterial blood flow is increased in portal hypertension and plays a role in elevated portal pressure, mechanical reduction of artery diameter should induce decreases in portal pressure and superior mesenteric arterial blood flow. In this study, calibrated superior mesenteric artery stenosis (induced with a 22-gauge needle) was performed in rats simultaneously with portal vein stenosis or 2 wk after creation of portal vein stenosis. Hemodynamic studies were performed 3 wk after induction of portal vein stenosis in conscious, unrestrained rats. At that time, neither weight loss nor digestive tract alterations were observed in rats with arterial stenosis. In neither group of rats with arterial stenosis was portal tributary blood flow significantly different from that of normal rats; nor was it significantly lower than in rats with portal vein stenosis without arterial stenosis. In both groups of rats with arterial stenosis, portal pressure was significantly lower (12.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg and 12.5 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, respectively) than in rats subjected to portal vein stenosis (15.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) but significantly higher than in controls (7.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg). In rats with arterial stenosis, cardiac index was also significantly lower than that in rats with portal vein stenosis but higher than that in controls. In conclusion, this study shows that both early and late superior mesenteric artery stenosis significantly reduce the degree of portal hypertension and the hyperkinetic state of rats with extrahepatic portal hypertension. Thus we can speculate that superior mesenteric artery stenosis might provide a new therapeutic approach for portal hypertension.",0
2646,28011037,"Assessment of safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (PROGRESS): a phase 3, extension study","""BACKGROUND: The 24-week safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy was shown in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs)-TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT-in patients with cystic fibrosis who were aged 12 years or older and homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. We aimed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of extended lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in this group of patients in PROGRESS, the long-term extension of TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. METHODS: PROGRESS was a phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, 96-week study of patients who completed TRAFFIC or TRANSPORT in 191 sites in 15 countries. Patients were eligible if they were at least 12 years old with cystic fibrosis and homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Exclusion criteria included any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering the study drug to the participant, history of drug intolerance, and history of poor compliance with the study drug. Patients who previously received active treatment in TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC remained on the same dose in PROGRESS. Patients who had received placebo in TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive lumacaftor (400 mg every 12 h)/ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h) or lumacaftor (600 mg once daily)/ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h). The primary outcome was to assess the long-term safety of combined therapy. The estimated annual rate of decline in percent predicted FEV(1) (ppFEV(1)) in treated patients was compared with that of a matched registry cohort. Efficacy analyses were based on modified intention-to-treat, such that data were included for all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01931839. FINDINGS: Between Oct 24, 2013, and April 7, 2016, 1030 patients from the TRANSPORT and TRAFFIC studies enrolled in PROGRESS, and 1029 received at least one dose of study drug. 340 patients continued treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h; 176 patients who had received placebo in the TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC studies initiated treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h, the commercially available dose, for which data are presented. The most common adverse events were infective pulmonary exacerbations, cough, increased sputum, and haemoptysis. Modest blood pressure increases seen in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT were also observed in PROGRESS. For patients continuing treatment, the mean change from baseline in ppFEV(1) was 0?5 (95% CI -0?4 to 1?5) at extension week 72 and 0?5 (-0?7 to 1?6) at extension week 96; change in BMI was 0?69 (0?56 to 0?81) at extension week 72 and 0?96 (0?81 to 1?11) at extension week 96. The annualised pulmonary exacerbation rate in patients continuing treatment through extension week 96 (0?65, 0?56 to 0?75) remained lower than the placebo rate in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. The annualised rate of ppFEV(1) decline was reduced in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared with matched controls (-1?33, -1?80 to -0?85 vs -2?29, -2?56 to -2?03). The efficacy and safety profile of the lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h groups was generally similar to that of the lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h groups. INTERPRETATION: The long-term safety profile of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy was consistent with previous RCTs. Benefits continued to be observed with longer-term treatment, and lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with a 42% slower rate of ppFEV(1) decline than in matched registry controls.

Mice homozygous for a FAH gene disruption have a neonatal lethal phenotype caused by liver dysfunction and do not represent an adequate model of the human disease. Here we demonstrate that treatment of affected animals with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzyol)-1,3-cyclohexanedione abolished neonatal lethality, corrected liver function and partially normalized the altered expression pattern of hepatic mRNAs. The prolonged lifespan of affected animals resulted in a phenotype analogous to human tyrosinaemia type I including hepatocellular carcinoma. The adult FAH-/- mouse will serve as useful model for studies of the pathophysiology and treatment of hereditary tyrosinaemia type I as well as hepatic cancer.",1
2650,15059018,Distributed network imaging and electrical impedance tomography of minimally invasive surgery,"Minimally invasive surgery has become highly dependent on imaging. For instance, the effectiveness of cryosurgery in treating cancer is dependent on knowledge of freezing extent, and relies on real-time imaging techniques for monitoring. However, medical imaging is often very expensive and therefore not available to most of the world population. Here we propose the concept of distributed network imaging (DNI) which could make medical imaging and minimally invasive surgery available to all who need these advanced medical modalities. We demonstrate the concept through electrical impedance tomography (EIT) of cryosurgery. The central idea is to develop an inexpensive measurend (data collection hardware) at a remote site and then to connect the measurend apparatus to an advanced image reconstruction server, which can serve a large number of distributed measurends at remote sites, using existing communication conduits (Ethernet, telephone, satellite, etc.). These conduits transfer the raw data from the measurend to the server and the reconstructed image from the server to the measurend. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality which utilizes tissue impedance variation to construct an image. The EIT measurend which consists of electrodes, a power supply, and means to measure voltage is inexpensive, and therefore suitable for DNI. EIT is also very well-suited to imaging cryosurgery since frozen tissue impedance is much higher than that of unfrozen tissue. In this study, we first develop numerical models to illustrate the theoretical ability of EIT to image cryosurgery. We begin with a simplified two dimensional model, and then extend the study to the more appropriate three dimensional model. Our simulated finite element phantoms and pixel-based Newton-Raphson reconstruction algorithms were able to produce easily identifiable images of frozen regions within tissue. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of the DNI concept though a case study using EIT to image an in vitro liver cryosurgery procedure through a modem. We find that the acquired raw data packets are less than 5KB per image and the images, using compression, do not exceed 50KB per image. ",0
2651,10915723,A Rho-specific exchange factor Ect2 is induced from S to M phases in regenerating mouse liver,"The ect2 oncogene was originally identified as a transforming complementary DNA (cDNA) from mouse epithelial cells in an expression cloning approach and encodes a product related to Rho-specific exchange factors and yeast cell cycle regulators. To explore the potential role of ect2 in the cell cycle, we examined the expression of the ect2 proto-oncogene in a liver regeneration model in mice after partial (two thirds) hepatectomy. We found that the expression of the ect2 transcript and protein were markedly elevated with the onset of DNA synthesis and remained elevated during G2 and M phases. The timing of ect2 expression matched that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and partially overlapped cell division cycle 2 (Cdc2) expression. In situ hybridization analysis showed that ect2 was expressed at a high level in cells undergoing mitosis in regenerating liver. Moreover, expression of a dominant negative or an oncogenic mutant of ect2 in cultured mouse hepatocytes resulted in a large increase in the number of binucleated cells. These findings showed that Ect2 is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner during liver regeneration, and suggest that it has an important role in the regulation of cytokinesis.",0

2653,25566165,Hearing and music in unilateral spatial neglect neuro-rehabilitation,"Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is an attention deficit in the contralesional side of space which occurs after a cerebral stroke, mainly located in the right hemisphere. USN patients are disabled in all daily activities. USN is an important negative prognostic factor of functional recovery and of socio-professional reinsertion. Thus, patient rehabilitation is a major challenge. As this deficit has been described in many sensory modalities (including hearing), many sensory and poly-sensory rehabilitation methods have been proposed to USN patients. They are mainly based on visual, tactile modalities and on motor abilities. However, these methods appear to be quite task-specific and difficult to transfer to functional activities. Very few studies have focused on the hearing modality and even fewer studies have been conducted in music as a way of improving spatial attention. Therefore, more research on such retraining needs is neccessary in order to make reliable conclusions on its efficiency in long-term rehabilitation. Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that music could be a promising tool to enhance spatial attention and to rehabilitate USN patients. In fact, music is a material closely linked to space, involving common anatomical and functional networks. The present paper aims firstly at briefly reviewing the different procedures of sensory retraining proposed in USN, including auditory retraining, and their limits. Secondly, it aims to present the recent scientific evidence that makes music a good candidate for USN patients' neuro-rehabilitation.  ",0
2654,15240257,The P450 monooxygenase BcABA1 is essential for abscisic acid biosynthesis in Botrytis cinerea,"""The phytopathogenic ascomycete Botrytis cinerea is known to produce abscisic acid (ABA), which is thought to be involved in host-pathogen interaction. Biochemical analyses had previously shown that, in contrast to higher plants, the fungal ABA biosynthesis probably does not proceed via carotenoids but involves direct cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate and subsequent oxidation steps. We present here evidence that this """"direct"""" pathway is indeed the only one used by an ABA-overproducing strain of B. cinerea. Targeted inactivation of the gene bccpr1 encoding a cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase reduced the ABA production significantly, proving the involvement of P450 monooxygenases in the pathway. Expression analysis of 28 different putative P450 monooxygenase genes revealed two that were induced under ABA biosynthesis conditions. Targeted inactivation showed that one of these, bcaba1, is essential for ABA biosynthesis: DeltaBcaba1 mutants contained no residual ABA. Thus, bcaba1 represents the first identified fungal ABA biosynthetic gene. """,0
2655,19288545,A rapid flow cytometric screening test for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease due to XIAP deficiency,"Deficiency of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), caused by BIRC4 gene mutations, is the second known cause of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), a rare primary immunodeficiency that often presents with life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Rapid diagnosis of the known genetic causes of HLH, including XIAP deficiency, facilitates the initiation of life-saving treatment and preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Until now, a rapid screening test for XIAP deficiency has not been available. To develop a flow cytometric screening test for XIAP deficiency, we first used lymphoblastic cell lines generated from controls and patients with BIRC4 mutations to identify two commercially available antibodies specific for native intracellular XIAP. Next, we used these antibodies to study control whole blood leukocyte XIAP expression. We then studied XIAP expression in leukocytes from patients with XLP due to BIRC4 mutations, maternal carriers, and patients following HCT. XIAP was expressed by the majority of all whole blood nucleated cells in normal controls. In contrast, XIAP was absent or decreased in all lymphocyte subsets, monocytes and granulocytes from four unrelated patients with XLP due to BIRC4 mutations. Bimodal distribution of XIAP expression was evident in two maternal carriers, with significant skewing toward cells expressing normal XIAP. Bimodal distribution was also observed in a patient following HCT. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular XIAP provides a rapid screening test for XLP due to XIAP deficiency. It also allows carrier detection and can be used to monitor donor versus recipient reconstitution following HCT. ",0
2656,24989971,Effects of the topographical extent of coronary artery ectasia on coronary blood flow in patients with aortic aneurysms,"Aortic aneurysms are associated with coronary artery ectasia (CAE). However, the relation between the extent of CAE and coronary blood flow in patients with aortic aneurysms is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to assess the angiographic characteristics and effects of the topographical extent of CAE on coronary blood flow in patients with aortic aneurysms. This study consisted of 93 consecutive patients with aortic aneurysms (AA group) and 79 patients without aortic aneurysms who had angiographically normal coronary arteries as the control group (Control group). Coronary flow velocity was determined using the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (TFC) and the topographical extent of CAE was assessed. In the AA group, 43 patients (46.2 %) had significant coronary artery stenosis and 37 patients (40.2 %) had diffuse CAE. TFC was significantly higher in the AA group than in the control group in all 3 coronary arteries. Furthermore, mean corrected TFC (CTFC) was significantly higher in the AA group than in the control group (40.1 ± 10.7 vs. 25.8 ± 6.5, p < 0.001). In the AA group, mean CTFC in patients with diffuse CAE was significantly higher than that in patients with segmental CAE (50.2 ± 8.7 vs. 33.6 ± 5.2, p < 0.001). The mean CTFC correlated positively with the topographical extent of CAE. Many patients with aortic aneurysms were accompanied with angiographic coronary artery stenosis and CAE. Furthermore, patients with aortic aneurysms had higher CTFC than those without aortic aneurysms and it was primarily driven by more frequent prevalence of diffuse CAE. ",0
2657,14711913,Use of high-cost operative procedures by Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in for-profit and not-for-profit health plans,"BACKGROUND: It is widely believed that for-profit health plans are more likely than not-for-profit health plans to respond to financial incentives by restricting access to care, especially access to high-cost procedures. Until recently, data to address this question have been limited. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that the rates of use of 12 common high-cost procedures would be lower in for-profit health plans than in not-for-profit plans. Using standardized Medicare HEDIS data on 3,726,065 Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age or older who were enrolled in 254 health plans during 1997, we compared for-profit and not-for-profit plans with respect to rates of cardiac catheterization, coronary-artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, reduction of femur fracture, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, partial colectomy, open cholecystectomy, closed cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and prostatectomy. We adjusted the comparisons for sociodemographic case mix and for characteristics of the health plans other than their tax status, including the plans' location. RESULTS: The rates of carotid endarterectomy, cardiac catheterization, coronary-artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were higher in for-profit health plans than they were in not-for-profit health plans; the rates of use of other common costly operative procedures were similar in the two types of plan. After adjustment for enrollee case mix and other characteristics of the plans, the for-profit plans had significantly higher rates than the not-for-profit plans for 2 of the 12 procedures we studied and had lower rates for none. The geographic locations of the health plans did not explain these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectations about the likely effects of financial incentives, the rates of use of high-cost operative procedures were not lower among beneficiaries enrolled in for-profit health plans than among those enrolled in not-for-profit health plans.",0
2658,24330348,The first recombinant FVIII produced in human cells--an update on its clinical development programme,"The development of inhibitors and the need for frequent venous access for FVIII injection are major challenges in current haemophilia treatment. Presently available recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products produced in hamster cell lines are associated with inhibitor formation in up to 32% of previously untreated patients. The new human cell line-derived recombinant human FVIII (Human-cl rhFVIII) protein is the first native, unmodified truly human rFVIII product produced in a human cell line without additive animal proteins. The aim of using a human cell line for the production of rFVIII is the avoidance of non-human epitopes on rFVIII, thereby potentially reducing the rate of inhibitor development, avoiding allergic reactions and allowing personalized prophylaxis with the chance of fewer infusions. Studies to date show that prophylaxis with Human-cl rhFVIII prevents 96% of bleeding events in adults with severe haemophilia A when compared to on-demand treatment. Available pharmacokinetic data with a mean half-life of 17.1 h allow personalized prophylaxis with the chance of fewer infusions. Studies in previously treated children and adults indicate that Human-cl rhFVIII is efficacious and safe in the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes and that none of the treated patients developed inhibitors or allergic reactions thus far.

2659,23833752,Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India),"The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.  ",0

Clinical and bacteriological assessments were performed before and 3-4 (short-term) and 25-30 days (long-term) after treatment. Only female patients with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection were eligible for inclusion in the study: 33 cases were given Fosfomycin trometamol and 30 cases Norfloxacin. In the overall etiology, Escherichia coli (74% of the strains found), Proteus mirabilis (6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) are highly predominant. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, the percentages of eradication in the two groups were similar: after the short-term test, 93.9% (31 of 33 patients) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 86.6% (26 of 30) in the Norfloxacin group, and after the long-term tests, 73.3% (22 of 30) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 77.89% (21 of 27) in the Norfloxacin group. There are no statistically significant differences. The duration of the reported side effects was significantly lower in the Fosfomycin trometamol group. The simplified dosage regimen (single dose) and its favorable benefit/risk ratio justifies the use of Fosfomycin trometamol as a treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in female patients.",1
2661,18392678,Inpatient admissions for drug-induced liver injury: results from a single center,"""Objective To review all cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) requiring hospitalization at a single tertiary care center. Methods Patient records were identified by ICD-9 codes for inpatient visits from November 1998 through March 2006. Results Of a total 83,265 hospital admissions during the study period, 40 were for DILI (0.048%). Thirteen patients had non-acetaminophen DILI (NA-DILI); 27 had acetaminophen-related DILI (A-DILI). In the NA-DILI group, mean age was 59 +/- 17.9 years and liver injury was classified as hepatocellular (7), cholestatic (5), or mixed (1). A variety of medications were implicated with antimicrobials being the most common class. Resolution occurred in seven, two died of complications related to hepatotoxicity, one underwent liver transplantation, and the outcome was undetermined in three who were lost to follow-up. In the A-DILI group, mean age was 35 +/- 11.0 years. Eighteen involved intentional overdose of acetaminophen; nine were associated with chronic use. The pattern of injury was hepatocellular in all. Resolution occurred in 4 patients, death in 8, and improvement in 15. Conclusions DILI is a rare cause of inpatient admission but is associated with significant mortality. Spontaneous resolution occurs in most patients but return to normal liver function may take months. Antimicrobial agents account for the largest proportion of NA-DILI.""",1

The goal of this study was to assess residents' perceptions of learning on inpatient services at a children's hospital in relation to perceived workload and actual patient census. This was a prospective cohort study of pediatric residents at 1 urban academic children's hospital. Surveys on educational experience were administered weekly to residents on 12 inpatient units from October 2010 to June 2011. Daily peak medical inpatient census data were collected, and Pearson correlations were performed. Mean weekly response rate was 25%. Perceived workload was correlated with weekly peak of patient census for interns (r = 0.66; P= .00) and senior residents (r = 0.73; P = .00). Many aspects of perceived learning were negatively correlated with perceived workload among interns and residents in """"acute care"""" units. Activities beyond direct patient care (eg, attending conferences, independent reading) revealed more negative correlation than educational experience during rounds. Among seniors, scores of aspects of perceived learning did not correlate with workload. The study found mostly negative associations between high perceived workload and perceived learning, especially for interns. Results suggest varied impact of workload on perceived learning by training year. Although patient care is essential for resident education, higher workload may adversely affect learning opportunities for pediatric trainees.

The IgG fractions of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis Stage I reacting exclusively with a pair of polypeptides at 48,000 daltons (p 48) on Western blot and from a patient with Stage III primary biliary cirrhosis reacting exclusively with a single 62,000 dalton polypeptide (p 62) were labeled with 125I; two radioimmunoassays were established detecting antimitochondrial antibodies against p 62 and p 48, respectively. Autologous sera blocked the assay, but the two reference sera did not block each other. Fourteen of 40 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis reacted with p 62, 6/40 with p 48 and 20 sera with both antigens. Sera from 200 patients with various hepatic and nonhepatic diseases were negative for anti-p 62 and anti-p 48. This collection of sera included 5 patients with nonhepatic autoimmune disorders, 3 with drug-induced pseudolupus syndrome and 2 with syphilis II, which were positive for antimitochondrial antibodies by immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial autoantigens p 62 and p 48 were both localized on mitoplasts, presumably inner mitochondrial membranes; they were thermolabile, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-sensitive, but resistant to DNAase, RNAase and neuraminidase treatments. In cesium chloride density gradients, p 62 floated at 1.28 gm per cm3 and p 48 at 1.30 gm per cm3. Thus, radioimmunoassays have been developed that specifically detect two distinct primary biliary cirrhosis-specific subtypes of antimitochondrial antibodies: anti-p 62 and anti-p 48. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera were positive for at least one of these antimitochondrial antibodies subtypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

2666,7979840,Long-term efficacy and safety of acarbose in the treatment of obese subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Acarbose delays the release of glucose from complex carbohydrates and disaccharides by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glucosidases, attenuating postprandial increments in blood glucose and insulin. This multicenter double-blind study compared the efficacy and safety of acarbose with placebo in the treatment of obese subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) managed by diet. METHODS: Two hundred twelve obese subjects with NIDDM who had not received any diabetic medication for at least 12 weeks were randomized to receive acarbose or placebo. The subjects were stratified by fasting glucose level above or below 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Based on the subject's therapeutic response and tolerance, the acarbose dosage was titrated from 50 to 300 mg three times per day. This 36-week study consisted of a 6-week pretreatment period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, and a 6-week posttreatment period. RESULTS: Ninety-one subjects given acarbose and 98 subjects who received placebo were evaluable for efficacy. During a standard meal tolerance test at the double-blind end point, the differences between treatment groups in mean change from baseline were as follows: 0.9 mmol/L (16 mg/dL) for fasting plasma glucose level, approximately 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) for postprandial plasma glucose level, and 0.59% (P < .0001) for hemoglobin A1c concentration (for all three measurements, values decreased in the acarbose group and increased in the placebo group). CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose improved both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia and improved overall glycemic control as measured by the hemoglobin A1c level. These findings suggest a beneficial role for acarbose in combination with diet in the treatment of obese subjects with NIDDM.",1
2667,20018961,Genomewide association study of leprosy,"BACKGROUND: The narrow host range of Mycobacterium leprae and the fact that it is refractory to growth in culture has limited research on and the biologic understanding of leprosy. Host genetic factors are thought to influence susceptibility to infection as well as disease progression. METHODS: We performed a two-stage genomewide association study by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using the Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina). We then tested three independent replication sets for an association between the presence of leprosy and 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were most strongly associated with the disease in the genomewide association study. Together, these replication sets comprised 3254 patients and 5955 controls. We also carried out tests of heterogeneity of the associations (or lack thereof) between these 93 SNPs and disease, stratified according to clinical subtype (multibacillary vs. paucibacillary). RESULTS: We observed a significant association (P<1.00x10(-10)) between SNPs in the genes CCDC122, C13orf31, NOD2, TNFSF15, HLA-DR, and RIPK2 and a trend toward an association (P=5.10x10(-5)) with a SNP in LRRK2. The associations between the SNPs in C13orf31, LRRK2, NOD2, and RIPK2 and multibacillary leprosy were stronger than the associations between these SNPs and paucibacillary leprosy. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of genes in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (which regulates the innate immune response) are associated with susceptibility to infection with M. leprae.",0
2668,32374916,C(24) -Ceramide Drives Gallbladder Cancer Progression through Directly Targeting PIP4K2C to Facilitate mTOR Signaling Activation,"The wide prevalence of chemoresistance and compromised early diagnosis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) has led to poor patient prognosis, requiring sustained efforts for the identification of effective biomarkers and novel therapeutic intervention. Ceramides have emerged as intracellular signaling molecules linked to tumorigenesis and therapeutic response in cancers. However, the clinical relevance of ceramides with gallbladder cancer has not been investigated. In present study, we revealed aberrant gene expressions (e.g. SPTLC1 and CERS2) of de novo ceramide biosynthesis and length-specific ceramide production in GBC tissues. Analyses of serum ceramide pattern in healthy control, gallbladder stone and GBC patients identified C24-Ceramide as a potential diagnostic biomarker for patients with GBC. Importantly, elevation of SPTLC1, CERS2 and its product C24-Ceramide were associated with tumor staging, distal metastasis and worse prognosis. In line with this, C(24) -Ceramide promoted GBC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, C24-Ceramide directly bound to PIP4K2C, a regulator of mTOR, to facilitate mTOR complex formation and activation. C6-Ceramide, an analogue of natural ceramide, competed with C24-Ceramide for PIP4K2C binding, thereby abrogating C24-Ceramide -mediated mTOR signaling activation and oncogenic activity. Furthermore, stimulation with C6-Ceramide significantly suppressed the proliferative and metastatic capacity of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which was dependent on PIP4K2C. Conclusion: Our findings highlights the clinical relevance of ceramide metabolism with GBC progression, and identify C24-Ceramide as a novel diagnostic biomarker for GBC. We propose that PIP4K2C is indispensable for C6-Ceramide as potential therapeutic intervention for GBC through a direct competition with C24-Ceramide.",0

2670,22605661,Safety and effectiveness of long-term allopurinol-thiopurine maintenance treatment in inflammatory bowel disease,"BACKGROUND: Thiopurines are the mainstay of conventional maintenance therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unfortunately, up to 50% of patients discontinue immunosuppressive therapy within 2 years due to intolerance or lack of efficacy. Allopurinol with low-dose thiopurine can optimize thiopurine metabolism for IBD patients with preferential shunting toward 6-methyl mercaptopurine (6-MMP) formation. The aim of this study was to assess long-term maintenance effectiveness and tolerability of allopurinol-thiopurine therapy in a larger multicenter cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Enrolled patients who failed monotherapy with thiopurines due to a skewed metabolism were subsequently treated with a combination therapy of allopurinol and low-dose thiopurine. Adverse events were monitored and therapeutic adherence was assessed. Seventy-seven IBD patients were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 19 months. RESULTS: The median 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration increased from 145 during monotherapy to 271 pmol/8 ? 10(8) red blood cell (RBC) after at least 8 weeks of combination therapy while reducing the thiopurine dosage (P < 0.001). In contrast, median 6-MMP concentrations decreased from 10,110 to 265 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC (P < 0.001). Leukopenia occurred in 12 patients (16%), requiring dose adaptation. Liver test abnormalities normalized in 81% of patients after the addition of allopurinol. Sixteen (21%) patients had to discontinue combination therapy. The percentage of patients still using combination therapy at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months was 87%, 85%, 76%, and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term combination therapy with allopurinol and low-dose thiopurines is an effective and well-tolerated treatment in IBD patients with a skewed thiopurine metabolism.",1

2672,23841062,Characterization of bioactive compounds in Tunisian bitter orange (Citrus aurantium L.) peel and juice and determination of their antioxidant activities,"Citrus aurantium peel and juice aroma compounds were investigated by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), whereas phenolic compounds analysis was performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Limonene was the major volatile compound of bitter orange peel (90.25%) and juice (91.61%). HPLC analysis of bitter orange peel and juice methanolic extracts indicated that phenolic acids constitute their main phenolic class representing 73.80% and 71.25%, respectively, followed by flavonoids (23.02% and 23.13%, resp.). p-Coumaric and ferulic acids were the most abundant phenolic compounds representing 24.68% and 23.79%, respectively, in the peel, while the juice contained 18.02% and 19.04%, respectively. The antioxidant activities of bitter orange peel and juice methanolic extracts have been evaluated using four in vitro assays, and the results were compared with the standard antioxidants (BHT, BHA, and ascorbic acid). Our findings demonstrated that Citrus aurantium peel and juice possess antioxidant activities which were less effective than those of antioxidant standards. Both extracts may be suggested as a new potential source of natural antioxidant.  ",0
2673,1629519,Distribution to the fetus and major organs of the rat following inhalation exposure to pyrene,"Concentrations of pyrene and total metabolites were determined for individual fetuses and selected maternal organs and tissues immediately and 6 h following a 95-min head-only exposure of pregnant Wistar rats, on gestation day 17, to five levels of pyrene over the range 200-800 mg m-3 as a microcondensation aerosol. The influence of uterine horn, side and position, on distribution to the fetus was assessed. The concentration of both pyrene and its metabolites increased more over the exposure range (eightfold) than did those in the fetus. Concentrations of pyrene or its metabolites in fetal tissues were not found to be related to its position on the uterine horn. There was an unexplained and significant (P less than 0.01) higher concentration of pyrene in fetuses on the right side relative to the left side of the uterine horn for the animals killed immediately following exposure. A comparison of the levels in maternal tissues measured immediately following the exposure and 6 h later showed that there was some redistribution of pyrene and its metabolites to the fat tissues, i.e. levels in the fat increased over the 6 h period following the exposure. Levels in the other tissues diminished during this period. In general, concentrations of pyrene and its metabolites were lowest in the fetal tissues relative to those in the sampled maternal organs and tissues. ",0
2674,15307009,Longitudinal effect of antiretroviral therapy on markers of hepatic toxicity: impact of hepatitis C coinfection,"""To characterize longitudinal hepatic toxicity of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected women with and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we measured alanine and aspartate aminotransferase values among women initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). For 312 HIV/HCV coinfected women who received HAART for a mean of 1.8 years, the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels >3 times and >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was low (<12% and <4%, respectively), and the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels declined over time. When we analyzed trends in aminotransferase levels according to type of HAART received among HCV-infected and uninfected women, we found that mean aminotransferase levels declined among 539 women receiving therapy with protease inhibitors (decreases of 5.34%-4.23% of the ULN per year; P values for trend of.007-.06), but mean values among 128 women receiving therapy with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors remained stable (from decreases of 1.65% to increases of 7.57% of the ULN per year; P values of.19-.71). Our findings lend support to assertions that antiretroviral therapy is safe for women with HCV infection.""",1
2675,16524112,Psychosocial aspects of patients with sexual dysfunction],"Sexual dysfunctions are common among the general population. An essential part of the assignments to specialized sexual medicine care units are from primary care physicians. In 2002 to 2004 for a period of 18 months questionnaires were given to all patients, who attended the special sexual medicine care unit at the University Hospital of Zurich for the first time. At the beginning of their treatment, the patients were questioned about different psychosocial characteristics and aspects of their sexuality. We studied 43 women (48.3%) and 46 men (51.7%). Women were with an average age of 33.8 years 10 years younger than men, 43.5 years. The most common sexual dysfunction in women was lack or loss of sexual desire (51.2%), followed by nonorganic vaginism (20.9%) and orgasm disorders (11.6%), in men erectile dysfunction (50.0%), followed by premature ejaculation (26.1%) and lack or loss of sexual desire (15.2%). The studied subjects showed distinctively lower values in their sense of coherence than men and women in the general population. The patients were much more anxious than people in the average population. The questioned men were also much more depressive than men in the general population and than the examined women. The examined men reported sexual wishes, needs and sexual activities significant more frequently than the examined women. As men and women with sexual dysfunctions are much more anxious than people from the general population, physicians should address sexual themes in the conversations with their patients carefully but actively.

2676,22613860,Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are rare but severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions that are to be considered medical emergencies. The average reported mortality rate for SJS is 1-5%, and up to 25-35% for TEN. TEN and SJS are characterized by more or less extensive painful erythematous and erosive lesions of the skin, conjunctiva and mucous membranes resulting from massive apoptosis of epithelial cells, and are considered to be two ends of a spectrum of severe epidermolytic adverse cutaneous drug reactions, differing only by their extent of skin detachment. Drugs including allopurinol, antibiotics, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs of the oxicam type are the main cause of SJS/TEN in most cases. Recent evidence supports a genetic susceptibility to SJS and TEN as exemplified by the strong association observed in Han Chinese between the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and SJS induced by carbamazepine. Diagnosis relies mainly on clinical signs together with the histological analysis of a skin biopsy showing typical full-thickness epidermal necrolysis due to extensive keratinocyte apoptosis. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune bullous dermatoses, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption and staphyloccocal scalded skin syndrome. Due to the high risk of mortality, management of patients with SJS/TEN requires rapid diagnosis, evaluation of the prognosis using SCORTEN, rapid identification and interruption of the culprit drug, specialized supportive care ideally in an intensive care unit, and the consideration of immunomodulatory agents such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin.",1
2677,25003640,Polymorphisms of leptin-b gene associated with growth traits in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides),"In mammals, leptin has been demonstrated to perform important roles in many physiological activities and to influence development, growth, metabolism and reproduction. However, in fish, its function is still unclear. Duplicate leptin genes, leptin-a and leptin-b, have been identified in the orange-spotted grouper. In the present study, the polymorphisms in the leptin-b gene of the orange-spotted grouper were detected, and the relation between these polymorphisms and 12 growth traits were analyzed. Six polymorphisms (including 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (c.14G>A, c.93A>G, c.149G>A) in exon 1, 2 SNPs (c.181A>G, c.193G>A) in intron 1, and 1 SNP (c.360C>T) in exon 2) were identified and genotyped from 200 different individuals. The results revealed that the SNP c.149G>A was significantly associated with growth traits, that the heterozygous mutation genotype GA having negative effects on growth traits. However, the other five SNPs (c.14G>A, c.93A>G, c.181A>G, c.193G>A, c.360C>T) did not show significant associations with all the growth traits. Compared with our findings in leptin-a gene, the results suggested that the leptin-a hormone has more important physiological effects in fish bodies than the leptin-b type. Moreover, leptin genes were supposed to be one class of major candidate genes of regulating growth traits in the orange-spotted grouper.  ",0

Subjective criteria included improvement in sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, frequency of sexual contacts, and quality of erection (penile rigidity) during sexual contact/intercourse. Objective criteria of outcome were based on improvement in penile rigidity determined by use of polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. Overall Yohimbine was found significantly more effective than placebo in terms of response rate: 71 vs 45%. Yohimbine was well-tolerated: Only 7% of patients rated tolerability fair or poor, and most adverse experiences were mild. There was no serious adverse event.""",1

Using non-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), transcripts for CYP1B1, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP2U1, CYP2W1, CYP4B1, CYP4F, CYP4V2, CYP4X1 and CYP4Z1 were detected in both sub-confluent and confluent MCF10A cells. By contrast, CYP1A2 mRNA was detected only in confluent MCF10A cells, while CYP1A1, CYP2S1 and CYP2F1 were detected predominantly or exclusively in sub-confluent cultures. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin treatment of confluent MCF10A cells markedly induced microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels, as determined by real-time RT-PCR, while treatment with 10(-4)M PhIP had little effect on these P450 transcript levels. Treatment of confluent MCF10A cells with PhIP (10(-4)M) for 24, 48 or 72 h produced time-dependent increases in the amounts of DNA adducts, as measured by (32)P-post-labeling. These results indicate that multiple P450s, including those known to catalyze PhIP N-oxidation, are expressed in MCF10A cells, and that this non-neoplastic human breast epithelial cell line contains sufficient enzymatic machinery to support PhIP bioactivation and generate DNA damage.

2681,29701074,Thymidine phosphorylase: the unforeseen driver in colorectal cancer treatment?,"5-Fluorouracil- and leucovorin-based chemotherapy regimens are the backbone of colorectal cancer treatment. The addition of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and monoclonal antibodies to this backbone has largely improved clinical outcomes, but has also led to new questions, with conflicting data frequently reported in studies. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is a nucleoside-metabolizing enzyme involved in 5-fluorouracil pharmacokinetics, as well as inflammatory responses, neoangiogenesis and apoptosis. TP expression is regulated by hypoxia, inflammatory cytokines and antitumoral agents. We hypothesize that TP could be the unforeseen driver in the conflicting data observed with different regimens commonly used in colorectal cancer treatment. Greater comprehension of the role of this enzyme in tumor progression and pyrimidine metabolism may lead to more accurate, patient-tailored therapy. ",0

Report of 16 cases,"Within a period of 3 years, 56 infants and children with embryofetal alcohol syndrome have been detected and examined for heart defects. All children were from mothers who had been addicted to alcohol even during pregnancy and they showed a typical pattern of malformations, as described by Lemoine et al. (1968) and Jones et al. (1973). In 16 cases cardiovascular malformations were confirmed by heart catheterisation or pathological examination. The overall incidence of heart defects in this syndrome was 29 per cent. The incidence rises to nearly 50 per cent in the more severe types of this syndrome. Atrial septal defects were found to be the most common heart defect (10 out of 16 cases); ventricular septal defects and other variable malformations occurred less frequently. The high incidence of heart defects indicates that alcoholism during pregnancy has to be considered as a serious and preventable cause of congenital heart disease. ",0
2684,28921638,Graft-infiltrating PD-L1(hi) cross-dressed dendritic cells regulate antidonor T cell responses in mouse liver transplant tolerance,"Although a key role of cross-dressing has been established in immunity to viral infection and more recently in the instigation of transplant rejection, its role in tolerance is unclear. We investigated the role of intragraft dendritic cells (DCs) and cross-dressing in mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched liver transplant tolerance that occurs without therapeutic immunosuppression. Although donor interstitial DCs diminished rapidly after transplantation, they were replaced in the liver by host DCs that peaked on postoperative day (POD) 7 and persisted indefinitely. Approximately 60% of these recipient DCs displayed donor MHC class I, indicating cross-dressing. By contrast, only a very minor fraction (0%-2%) of cross-dressed DCs (CD-DCs) was evident in the spleen. CD-DCs sorted from liver grafts expressed much higher levels of T cell inhibitory programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and high levels of interleukin-10 compared with non-CD-DCs (nCD-DCs) isolated from the graft. Concomitantly, high incidences of programed death protein 1 (PD-1)(hi) T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM-3)(+) exhausted graft-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells were observed. Unlike nCD-DCs, the CD-DCs failed to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic T cells but markedly suppressed antidonor host T cell proliferation. CD-DCs were much less evident in allografts from DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)(-/-) donors that were rejected acutely. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that graft-infiltrating PD-L1(hi) CD-DCs may play a key role in the regulation of alloimmunity and in the induction of liver transplant tolerance.

2685,12444179,Glycoprotein-D-adjuvant vaccine to prevent genital herpes,"BACKGROUND: An effective prophylactic vaccine would help control the spread of genital herpes. METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized trials of a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein-D-subunit vaccine with alum and 3-O-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A in subjects whose regular sexual partners had a history of genital herpes. In Study 1, subjects were seronegative for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2; in Study 2, subjects were of any HSV serologic status. At months 0, 1, and 6, subjects received either vaccine or a control injection and were evaluated for 19 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of genital herpes disease in all subjects in Study 1 and in HSV-2-seronegative female subjects in Study 2. RESULTS: A total of 847 subjects who were seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 (268 of them women, in Study 1) and 1867 subjects who were seronegative for HSV-2 (710 of them women, in Study 2) underwent randomization and received injections. Vaccination was well tolerated and elicited humoral and cellular responses. Overall, the efficacy of the vaccine was 38 percent in Study 1 (95 percent confidence interval, -18 to 68 percent; 15 cases occurred in the vaccine group and 24 in the control group), and efficacy in female subjects was 42 percent in Study 2 (95 percent confidence interval, -31 to 74 percent; 9 cases occurred in the vaccine group and 16 in the control group). In both studies, further analysis showed that the vaccine was efficacious in women who were seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2: efficacy in Study 1 was 73 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 91 percent; P=0.01), and efficacy in Study 2 was 74 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 93 percent; P=0.02). It was not efficacious in women who were seropositive for HSV-1 and seronegative for HSV-2 at base line or in men. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that the glycoprotein D vaccine has efficacy against genital herpes in women who are seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 at base line but not in those who are seropositive for HSV-1 and seronegative for HSV-2. It had no efficacy in men, regardless of their HSV serologic status.",0
2686,16917217,Fatty liver and transaminase changes with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy,"We investigated the time it took to develop fatty liver and changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Liver sonography to detect fatty liver and measurement of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels were performed regularly for patients with early breast cancer. The results were compared in groups of patients with and without adjuvant tamoxifen as well as those on chemotherapy. Eighty-two of 156 patients treated with tamoxifen developed fatty liver, compared with eight of 62 patients not taking it. Fatty liver appeared as early as 3 months after beginning tamoxifen and was detected within 2 years in most cases. It persisted for 48 months after discontinuing tamoxifen in 17 of the 82 patients who developed it. The incidence of fatty liver in patients receiving both chemotherapy and tamoxifen was the same as that in patients receiving tamoxifen alone. While 115 patients had elevations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase or both, the magnitude of the elevation was clinically significant in only 32 patients. Patients on both chemotherapy and tamoxifen had a higher incidence of elevated transaminases than those on tamoxifen alone. Adjuvant tamoxifen increases the incidence of fatty liver, but has only a minimal effect on aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Fatty liver may appear as early as 3 months after beginning tamoxifen and may persist for more than 4 years after discontinuing it. Therefore, long-term follow-up is warranted. Chemotherapy is not clearly associated with fatty liver, but may cause a greater degree of hepatocellular damage than does tamoxifen.",1
2687,24849545,The combination of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R) antibody cixutumumab and mitotane as a first-line therapy for patients with recurrent/metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma: a multi-institutional NCI-sponsored trial,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy, which lacks an effective systemic treatment. Abnormal activation of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R) has been frequently observed. Preclinical studies demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of IGF1R signaling in ACC has antiproliferative effects. A previous phase I trial with an IGF1R inhibitor has demonstrated biological activity against ACC. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of the IGF1R inhibitor cixutumumab (IMC-A12) in association with mitotane as a first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic ACC. We conducted a multicenter, randomized double-arm phase II trial in patients with irresectable recurrent/metastatic ACC. The original protocol included two treatment groups: IMC-A12 + mitotane and mitotane as a single agent, after an initial single-arm phase for safety evaluation with IMC-A12 + mitotane. IMC-A12 was dosed at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The starting dose for mitotane was 2 g daily, subsequently adjusted according to serum levels/symptoms. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). This study was terminated before the randomization phase due to slow accrual and limited efficacy. Twenty patients (13 males, 7 females) with a median age of 50.2 years (range 21.9-79.6) were enrolled for the single-arm phase. Therapeutic effects were observed in 8/20 patients, including one partial response and seven stable diseases. The median PFS was 6 weeks (range 2.66-48). Toxic events included two grade 4 (hyperglycemia and hyponatremia) and one grade 5 (multiorgan failure). Although the regimen demonstrated activity in some patients, the relatively low therapeutic efficacy precluded further studies with this combination of drugs.",1

We report here a case of major depression in a 27-year-old woman who abruptly reduced cigarette consumption from 35 to 8 cigarettes per day during the baseline period. A multi-component behavioural programme was applied to stop smoking, together with pharmacotherapy and Beck's cognitive therapy for depression. Twelve months after ending treatment, the patient was still abstaining from smoking, and she showed no signs of depressive symptomatology. ",0
2691,19475692,Nonstructural 3/4A protease of hepatitis C virus activates epithelial growth factor-induced signal transduction by cleavage of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a worldwide major cause of chronic liver disease with a high tendency to establish a persistent infection. To permit persistent replication of viral genomes through the cellular translation machinery without affecting host cell viability, viruses must have developed mechanisms to control cellular cascades required for sufficient viral replication, on the one hand, and to adapt viral replication to the cellular requirements on the other hand. The present study aimed to further elucidate mechanisms by which HCV targets growth factor signaling of the host cell and their implications for viral replication. The study describes a novel mechanism by which HCV influences the activation of the epithelial growth factor receptor/Akt pathway through a nonstructural (NS)3/4A-dependent down-regulation of the ubiquitously expressed tyrosine phosphatase T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP). NS3/4A is demonstrated to cleave TC-PTP protease-dependently in vitro at two cleavage sites. The in vivo relevance of this finding is supported by the fact that down-regulation of TC-PTP protein expression could also be demonstrated in HCV-infected individuals and in transgenic mice with intrahepatic expression of NS3/4A. CONCLUSION: This down-regulation of TC-PTP results in an enhancement of epithelial growth factor (EGF)-induced signal transduction and increases basal activity of Akt, which is demonstrated to be essential for the maintenance of sufficient viral replication. Hence, therapeutic targeting of NS3/4A may not only disturb viral replication by blocking the processing of the viral polyprotein but also exerts unforeseen indirect antiviral effects, further diminishing viral replication.",0
2692,23844038,"""Dabrafenib; preclinical characterization, increased efficacy when combined with trametinib, while BRAF/MEK tool combination reduced skin lesions""","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation has been implicated in many types of human cancer. BRAF mutations that constitutively activate MAPK signalling and bypass the need for upstream stimuli occur with high prevalence in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this report we characterize the novel, potent, and selective BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436). Cellular inhibition of BRAF(V600E) kinase activity by dabrafenib resulted in decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation through an initial G1 cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. In a BRAF(V600E)-containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild-type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor-induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor.",1

METHODS: A 27-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/day with placebo in the treatment of 888 patients with FM. Two composite responder definitions were used to classify each patient's individual response to therapy. """"FM responders"""" concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain (visual analog scale 24-h morning recall), patient global impression of change (PGIC), and physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Component Summary); while """"FM pain responders"""" concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain and PGIC. RESULTS: At the primary endpoint, after 3-month stable dose treatment, a significantly higher percentage of milnacipran-treated patients met criteria as FM responders versus placebo (milnacipran 200 mg/day, p = 0.017; milnacipran 100 mg/day, p = 0.028). A significantly higher percentage of patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/day also met criteria as FM pain responders versus placebo (p = 0.032). Significant pain reductions were observed after Week 1 with both milnacipran doses. At 15 weeks, milnacipran 200 mg/day led to significant improvements over placebo in pain (realtime, daily and weekly recall; all measures, p < 0.05), PGIC (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.016), cognition (p = 0.025), and multiple SF-36 domains.

The results revealed that both honeys exerted a protective effect against CISP-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity as demonstrated by decreasing liver and kidney function. Manuka honey also prevented CISP-induced histopathological changes observed in the liver and decreased the changes seen in the kidneys. Talh honey decreased CISP-induced liver histopathological changes but had no effect on CISP-induced kidney histopathological changes. Both honeys reduced the oxidative stress in the liver. Conversely, they have no effect on kidney oxidative stress, except that manuka honey increased CAT activity. GC-MS analysis showed the presence of the antioxidant octadecanoic acid in talh honey while heneicosane and hydrocinnamic acid were present at a higher content in manuka honey. The molecular mechanism was to limit the expression of inflammatory signals, including COX-2 and NF-κB, and the expression of the apoptotic signal, BAX and caspase-3 while inducing Bcl-2 expression.

INTERVENTION AND MANAGEMENT: Discontinuation of donepezil and sertraline therapy with subsequent improvement evidenced by liver biopsy and liver function tests. RESULTS: An older woman with Alzheimer's disease was admitted to a dementia care facility because of aggressive behavior. Treatment with sertraline was initiated in February 1998. Sertraline doses were increased gradually to 200 mg daily by May 1998, and some improvement in behavior was seen. Concomitant therapy with donepezil 5 mg qhs was initiated June 26, 1998. Ten days later, confusion and jaundice were noted. Total bilirubin was 5.6 mg/dL, GGTP was 1,208 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 369 IU/L. Computed tomography revealed cholelithiasis without ductal dilation. Liver, spleen, and pancreas seemed normal. Donepezil and sertraline were discontinued. The patient was admitted to our institution and treated for dehydration. A liver biopsy revealed scattered portal eosinophils and prominent cholestasis consistent with acute chemical hepatitis.

This medication has been studied and used in many disease processes hallmarked by poor neuronal transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems including: multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injuries (SCI), botulism, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. It has also been postulated as a potential treatment of verapamil toxicity and reversal agent for anesthesia-induced neuromuscular blockade. To date, there have been limited reports of either intentional or accidental 4-AP toxicity in humans. Both a case of a patient with 4-AP toxicity and review of the literature are discussed, highlighting commonalities observed in overdose. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man with progressive MS presented with diaphoresis, delirium, agitation, and choreathetoid movements after a presumed 4-AP overdose. 4-AP concentration at 6 h was 140 ng/mL. With aggressive benzodiazepine administration and intubation, he recovered uneventfully. DISCUSSION: The commonalities associated with 4-AP toxicity conforms to what is known about its mechanism of action combining cholinergic features including diaphoresis, altered mental status, and seizures with dopamine-related movement abnormalities including tremor, choreoathetosis, and dystonia. Management of patients poisoned by 4-AP centers around good supportive care with definitive airway management and controlling CNS hyperexcitability aggressively with gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist agents. Adjunctive use of dopamine antagonists for extrapyramidal effects after sedation is a treatment possibility. As 4-aminopyridine recently received Federal Drug Administration approval for the treatment of ambulation in patients with MS, physicians should be keenly aware of its presentation, mechanism of action, and management in overdose.",1

Transient elastography (TE) might detect patients harbouring such a condition. Our objective was to search for the presence of abnormal liver stiffness (LS) in a cohort of HIV-infected patients without HBV or HCV coinfection and to assess the related factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted. LS was assessed by TE in 258 HIV-infected patients without HBV or HCV coinfection and with no evidence of acute hepatotoxicity or other origins of liver disease. LS values > or =7.2 kPa were considered abnormal. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with abnormal LS. RESULTS: Abnormal LS was observed in 29 (11.2%) patients. A total of 18 (16.4%) patients previously treated with ddI and 11 (7.4%) of those who never received ddI had LS values > or =7.2 kPa (P=0.02). The prevalence of abnormal LS was higher in patients previously treated with abacavir than in those who had never received abacavir (15 [21.7%] versus 14 [7.4%]; P=0.001). After multivariate analyses, age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.002-1.1; P=0.004) alcohol intake >50 g/day (AOR 7.2, 95% CI 2.6-19.7; P<0.0001), CD4(+) T-cell count <200 cells/ml (AOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.06-11.007; P=0.03), time on ddI treatment (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.52; P=0.001) and previous abacavir exposure (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.18-7.67; P=0.02) were independently associated with abnormal LS. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of abnormal LS in HIV-infected patients without HBV or HCV coinfection is substantial. Long-term exposure to ddI is a major cause of liver damage in these patients.""",1
2701,9879059,Mutagenesis of the human 5-HT1B receptor: differences from the closely related 5-HT1A receptor and the role of residue F331 in signal transduction,"We have used a combination of sequence comparisons, computer-based modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the molecular interactions involved in ligand binding and signal transduction of the human 5-HT1B receptor. Two amino acid residues, S212 in transmembrane region (TM) V and F331 in TM VI, were replaced by alanines. These amino acids are conserved in many G protein-coupled receptors and therefore likely to be important for receptor function. The mutant receptors were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The 5-HT-like agonist 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-CT) bound with 15-fold lower affinity to the S212A mutant as compared to wild-type receptor and the antagonist methiothepin bound with 17-fold lower affinity to the F331A mutant. No reduction in the affinity of 5-HT was seen for the S212A mutant, although an equivalent mutation in the 5-HT1A receptor resulted in a 100-fold reduction of 5-HT binding. The inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by 5-HT was significantly reduced in cells expressing the F331A mutant, even though the endogenous ligand 5-HT bound with somewhat increased affinity. Methiothepin acted as an inverse agonist and increased the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production at both the wild-type receptor and the mutants, and the effect was stronger on the F331A mutant. These results suggest that F331 is involved in the conformational changes necessary for signal transduction. ",0

Ultrasound examinations of gallbladders were performed on days 1 and 14 of therapy and 2 weeks posttherapy if abnormalities were observed on day 14. Eight patients were unevaluable because of abnormal base-line gallbladder sonograms. Thirty-six patients (ceftriaxone, n = 28; placebo, n = 8) demonstrated normal baseline gallbladder sonograms and were evaluated for the development of change. A total of 6 of 28 (21.4%) ceftriaxone-treated patients and 1 of 8 (12.5%) patients who received the placebo demonstrated abnormal gallbladder sonograms on day 14 (P = 0.491). Four of the six ceftriaxone-treated patients demonstrating abnormal sonograms were clinically asymptomatic, while two patients reported vomiting. The abnormal sonograms of gallbladders of patients treated with ceftriaxone returned to normal between 9 and 26 days posttherapy. These data suggest an association between ceftriaxone treatment and the development of gallbladder abnormalities on ultrasound examination which resolve spontaneously on discontinuation of ceftriaxone therapy.""",1

The conventional influenza vaccine platform is based on stimulating immunity against the major neutralizing antibody target, hemagglutinin (HA), by virus attenuation or inactivation. Improvements to this conventional system have focused primarily on improving production and immunogenicity. Cell culture, reverse genetics, and baculovirus expression technology allow for safe and scalable production, while adjuvants, dose variation, and alternate routes of delivery aim to improve vaccine immunogenicity. Fundamentally different approaches that are currently under development hope to signal new generations of influenza vaccines. Such approaches target nonvariable regions of antigenic proteins, with the idea of stimulating cross-protective antibodies and thus creating a """"universal"""" influenza vaccine. While such approaches have obvious benefits, there are many hurdles yet to clear. Here, we discuss the process and challenges of the current influenza vaccine platform as well as new approaches that are being investigated based on the same antigenic target and newer technologies based on different antigenic targets.

2704,25257811,Surface and boney landmarks for sacral neuromodulation: a cadaveric study,"Standard external landmarks have been suggested as a guide for in-office percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE), but validity of these landmarks has not been assessed. Our objective was to determine whether the standard 9 cm from the tip of the coccyx indicates the position of the S3 sacral foramen and whether other boney landmarks and measurements improved positioning. Measurements and distances between external boney landmarks were obtained in 22 embalmed cadavers. Spinal needles were placed 9 cm superior to the coccyx and 2 cm lateral to midline bilaterally. After dissection, internal measurements relating to sacral length, position of S3, and location of the needle in relation to S3 were recorded. Correlations among measured variables were assessed using descriptive statistics. Mean distance from the tip of coccyx to S3 was 9.26 cm (±0.84), from S3 to midline 2.30 cm (±0.2); from needle to S3 1.25 cm, and needle placement was as likely to be placed above or below S3; and S2-S3 and S3-S4 interforamenal distance 1.48 cm (±0.30) and 1.48 cm (±0.24), respectively. Mean distance from S3 to sacroiliac joint (SIJ) was shorter than S2 to SIJ. All associations between external measurements and length from tip of coccyx to S3 were not significant. A distance 9 cm from the tip of the coccyx is a reasonable starting landmark for in-office blind PNE. However, given the variability in coccyx length, caution should be taken; also, sensory-motor response is necessary to confirm proper placement. ",0

Here, the cloning of TdcB (molecular weight 36 kDa) from Salmonella typhimurium with an N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag and its overexpression in Escherichia coli is reported. TdcB was purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique in three different crystal forms.

Although it seems likely that these conditions have a different pathogenesis, the drugs used to treat them are the same. Our study used a cross-sectional clinical database to compare drug use and side-effect profile in these 2 diseases. METHODS: The CASPAR study collected data on 588 patients with PsA and 536 controls, 70% of whom had RA. Data on disease modifying drug treatments used over the whole illness were recorded, together with their outcomes, including adverse events, for RA and PsA. RESULTS: For both diseases methotrexate (MTX) was the most frequently used disease modifying drug (39% of patients with PsA, 30% with RA), with over 70% of patients in both diseases still taking the drug. Other drugs were used with the following frequencies in PsA and RA, respectively: sulfasalazine 22%/13%, gold salts 7%/11%, antimalarial drugs 5%/14%, corticosteroids 10%/17%, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs 6%/5%. Compared to RA, cyclosporine and anti-TNF agents were less likely to be ineffective in PsA. Compared to RA, subjects with PsA were less likely to be taking MTX and more likely to be taking anti-TNF agents. Hepatotoxicity with MTX was more common in PsA and pulmonary toxicity with MTX was found more often in RA. CONCLUSION: These data provide insight into prescribing patterns of disease modifying drugs in RA and PsA in a large international cohort, together with the differential adverse events of these drugs between these diseases.",1
2707,10462381,"Deficient assembly and function of gap junctions in Trf1, a trafficking mutant of the human liver-derived cell line HuH-7","The Trf1 cell line, selected from the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7, manifests altered trafficking of various plasma membrane proteins. In particular, there is a striking loss of State 2 asialoglycoprotein receptors. This cell line is shown here to also manifest defects in function and assembly of gap junctions comprising connexin43 (Cx43). No alteration of Cx43 expression or phosphorylation was apparent. Nevertheless, immunostaining of Cx43 revealed that fewer and smaller gap junctions were present at appositional membrane areas in Trf1 cells as compared with parental HuH-7. This correlated with a significant attenuation in gap junction-mediated communication between Trf1 cells as demonstrated by markedly decreased dye transfer and their reduced ability to propagate mechanically evoked Ca(2+) waves. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) of Cx43 in HuH-7 cells indicated that the pIs of this protein were significantly lower than that predicted from its amino acid sequence; no differences in pI were evident in Cx43 from Trf1 cells and the HuH-7 cell line. The effects of the Trf1 mutation on assembly and function of gap junctions indicate that this mutation influences trafficking of Cx43. Connexins differ in several respects from other membrane proteins thus far analyzed in Trf1 mutants: gap junctions localize exclusively to the lateral cell surface; they are not glycoproteins; and they do not play a role in endocytic pathways. The disruption of trafficking of Cx43 by this mutation suggests that the Trf1 phenotype is a defect at a common point along the trafficking pathway of cell-surface proteins, irrespective of their ultimate destination on the cell surface or their glycosylation profile.",0

2709,21846363,Renin angiotensin system and gender differences in dopaminergic degeneration,"There are sex differences in dopaminergic degeneration. Men are approximately two times as likely as premenopausal women of the same age to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been shown that the local renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a prominent role in sex differences in the development of chronic renal and cardiovascular diseases, and there is a local RAS in the substantia nigra and dopaminergic cell loss is enhanced by angiotensin via type 1 (AT1) receptors. In the present study, we observed that intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine induced a marked loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of male rats, which was significantly higher than the loss induced in ovariectomized female rats given estrogen implants (i.e. rats with estrogen). However, the loss of dopaminergic neurons was significantly lower in male rats treated with the AT1 antagonist candesartan, and similar to that observed in female rats with estrogen. The involvement of the RAS in gender differences in dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed with AT1a-null mice lesioned with the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP. Significantly higher expression of AT1 receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and NADPH-oxidase complex activity, and much lower levels of AT2 receptors were observed in male rats than in female rats with estrogen. The results suggest that brain RAS plays a major role in the increased risk of developing PD in men, and that manipulation of brain RAS may be an efficient approach for neuroprotective treatment of PD in men, without the feminizing effects of estrogen.

We have shown previously that TAP possesses a peptide-recognition site with broad specificity and that MHC class I/beta 2m dimers physically associate with TAP. Here, we further characterize the nature of the peptide-binding site on TAP, and the site of interaction of TAP with MHC class I/beta 2m dimers. TAP photoaffinity labeling experiments revealed that both TAP1 and TAP2 are photolabeled by two distinct photopeptide analogues, suggesting that elements of both TAP1 and TAP2 compose the peptide-recognition site. TAP photolabeling analysis on transfectant cell lines that express TAP1 and TAP2 both individually and together revealed that efficient formation of the peptide-binding site occurs only when TAP1 and TAP2 are coexpressed, which correlates with the finding that peptide translocation via TAP occurs only in the presence of both TAP1 and TAP2. These data strongly support the notion that TAP functions as a heterodimer. MHC class I/beta 2m dimers were shown to associate with individual TAP1 chains but were not detectable with individual TAP2 chains. This result suggests that the site of interaction for MHC class I/beta 2m dimers with TAP is on TAP1. ",0

Since 2000 many centers have substituted AZA by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). However, in LT the superiority of MMF over AZA is not clearly demonstrated. Therefore, we questioned the benefit of MMF versus AZA in LT with regard to rejection, renal dysfunction and hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence and survival. Using a literature search, relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies were identified: two RCTs compared MMF to AZA only for acute rejection. Treated rejection was less with MMF in only one RCT (38.5% vs. 47.7%; p = 0.025), with no difference in patient and graft survival. No RCTs compared MMF and AZA in patients with CNI-related chronic renal dysfunction. Among two studies evaluating MMF, with substitution of AZA, one was stopped due to severe rejection. Recurrent HCV was less severe in 5/9 studies with AZA compared with 2/17 using MMF, six of which documented worse recurrence. Published data in LT show little, if any, clinical benefit of MMF versus AZA. RCTs should reevaluate AZA in LT.

2715,24099020,Acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity,"Acetaminophen (APAP) is the leading worldwide cause of drug overdose and acute liver failure (ALF). Single overdose ingestion and therapeutic misadventure may cause hepatotoxicity. Several factors, such as concomitant alcohol use or abuse, concurrent medications, genetic factors, and nutritional status, can influence the susceptibility and severity of APAP hepatotoxicity. Early manifestations of APAP hepatotoxicity are nonspecific, but require prompt recognition by physicians. Patients with repeated overdose tend to present late, and in such hepatotoxicity may have already evolved. N-acetylcysteine is a very effective antidote when giving within 8 hours, and is also recommended after a presentation of hepatotoxicity and ALF. The prognosis of patients with APAP-induced ALF is better than other causes of ALF. Liver transplantation should be offered to those who are unlikely to survive.",1
2716,15070665,Rituximab for primary chronic cold agglutinin disease: a prospective study of 37 courses of therapy in 27 patients,"Conventional therapies for primary chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) are ineffective, but remissions after treatment with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab have been described in a small, prospective trial and in some case reports. In this study we report on 37 courses of rituximab administered prospectively to 27 patients. Fourteen of 27 patients responded to their first course of rituximab, and 6 of 10 responded to re-treatment. In both groups combined, responses were achieved after 20 of 37 courses, giving an overall response rate of 54%. We observed 1 complete and 19 partial responses. Two nonresponders and 3 patients who experienced relapse received second-line therapy with interferon-alpha combined with a new course of rituximab, and 1 nonresponder and 2 patients who experienced relapse achieved partial responses. Responders achieved a median increase in hemoglobin levels of 40 g/L (4 g/dL). Median time to response was 1.5 months, and median observed response duration was 11 months. We conclude that rituximab is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for CAD. Histologic and flow cytometric findings suggest that some of the effect may be mediated by mechanisms other than the elimination of clonal lymphocytes. We were unable to predict responses from the hematologic, immunologic, or histologic parameters before therapy. ",0
2717,10492496,Oxaprozin-induced symptomatic hepatotoxicity,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of symptomatic hepatotoxicity attributed to oxaprozin use. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital with malaise, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain. The patient was found to have severe jaundice with liver enzyme elevation. Laboratory test results for potential etiologies were negative, except for the use of oxaprozin for the preceding six weeks. Diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity was made by liver biopsy. The patient's symptoms resolved and liver enzymes normalized after oxaprozin was discontinued. DISCUSSION: Symptomatic hepatic effects attributable to most nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rare and usually mild. Oxaprozin has been shown to cause mild elevation of liver enzymes in clinical studies. This is the second reported case of presumed oxaprozin-induced icteric hepatitis. The mechanism of oxaprozin-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear, but is thought to be due to metabolic idiosyncrasy. Most NSAID reactions are hepatocellular and occur because of individual susceptibility (idiosyncrasy). In general, people aged >40 years and women are more predisposed to NSAID-induced liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although this toxicity is rare, clinicians should be aware of the potential for oxaprozin to cause hepatotoxicity and use caution when prescribing this medication. This case also stresses the importance of careful inquiry regarding drug or toxin exposure in cases of unexplained hepatitis.",1
2718,8624173,Safety of antioxidant vitamins,"As a result of the many scientific and popular press reports of the benefits of antioxidant vitamins (vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin E, and ascorbic acid), it is estimated that 40% of the US population is consuming vitamin supplements. The efficacy of these supplements is not yet proved, and some have questioned their safety. Approximately 10 to 15 cases of vitamin A toxic reactions are reported per year in the United States, usually at doses greater than 100,000 IU/d. No adverse effects have been reported for beta-carotene. The frequency of vitamin E toxic reactions is not well delineated, but case reports are few at dosages less than 3200 mg/d. Ascorbic acid toxic reactions are rare at dosages less than 4 g/d. Despite a lack of clinical trial data, it seems that antioxidant vitamins are safe, although prudence might dictate their avoidance by women of childbearing potential, persons with liver disease or renal dysfunction, and those taking certain medications or undergoing specific laboratory tests.",1
2719,23840315,Structure and dynamics of the gp120 V3 loop that confers noncompetitive resistance in R5 HIV-1(JR-FL) to maraviroc,"Maraviroc, an (HIV-1) entry inhibitor, binds to CCR5 and efficiently prevents R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from using CCR5 as a coreceptor for entry into CD4(+) cells. However, HIV-1 can elude maraviroc by using the drug-bound form of CCR5 as a coreceptor. This property is known as noncompetitive resistance. HIV-1(V3-M5) derived from HIV-1(JR-FLan) is a noncompetitive-resistant virus that contains five mutations (I304V/F312W/T314A/E317D/I318V) in the gp120 V3 loop alone. To obtain genetic and structural insights into maraviroc resistance in HIV-1, we performed here mutagenesis and computer-assisted structural study. A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that combinations of V3 mutations are required for HIV-1(JR-FLan) to replicate in the presence of 1 µM maraviroc, and that a T199K mutation in the C2 region increases viral fitness in combination with V3 mutations. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the gp120 outer domain V3 loop with or without the five mutations showed that the V3 mutations induced (i) changes in V3 configuration on the gp120 outer domain, (ii) reduction of an anti-parallel β-sheet in the V3 stem region, (iii) reduction in fluctuations of the V3 tip and stem regions, and (iv) a shift of the fluctuation site at the V3 base region. These results suggest that the HIV-1 gp120 V3 mutations that confer maraviroc resistance alter structure and dynamics of the V3 loop on the gp120 outer domain, and enable interactions between gp120 and the drug-bound form of CCR5.

2720,2958399,Enhanced autoreactivity of T-lymphocytes in primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic, cholestatic liver disease in which immune mechanisms are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis. We have determined the frequencies and functional phenotypes of autoreactive T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood specimens from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and healthy adults as an indicator of autoreactivity in primary sclerosing cholangitis. We found a significant increase in the percentage of autoreactive suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that become activated in the T-, non-T-autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction in primary sclerosing cholangitis patients (p less than 0.002). Blastogenesis in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients was significantly decreased (p less than 0.02), and the magnitude of the decrease correlated directly with the percentage of activated suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). The percentage of autoreactive, suppressor T-lymphocytes was increased in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients (p less than 0.0001); and suppression of mitogen-induced blastogenesis by autologous concanavalin A-treated mononuclear cells was significantly enhanced. These results, which were unrelated to the histologic stage of liver disease and the presence or absence of active colitis, document the presence of an expanded population of T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis that became activated on exposure to autologous major histocompatibility antigens in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. We hypothesize that these autoreactive cells may be a marker or may participate as effector cells in cell-mediated autoimmunity in primary sclerosing cholangitis.",0
2721,20172201,[Does bevacizumab have a protective effect on hepatotoxicity induced by chemotherapy?],"Although the prognosis of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) has improved dramatically with oxaliplatin and irinotecan, the enthusiasm for the preoperative use of these cytotoxic agents is being tempered by concerns about their impact on the nontumoral liver parenchyma. Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent that specifically targets the vascular endothelial growth factor, exerts an antitumor effect by inhibiting the development of the vascular network that is promoted by the tumor and mandatory for its growth. Yet angiogenesis is also a physiologic event contributing to wound healing and tissue regeneration. To date, it is well documented that the use of bevacizumab in combination with cytotoxic agents greatly improves pathologic response. Also well described is the protective effect of bevacizumab against sinusoidal injuries induced by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Up to now, no side effects related to the perioperative use of bevacizumab have been reported in the setting of liver resection for CLM, and bevacizumab was shown not to impair liver regeneration following portal vein embolization. The clinical consequences of the protective effect of bevacizumab against sinusoidal injuries are hard to evaluate as patient selection and preparation have improved and these improvements contribute greatly to the favorable outcomes following liver resection for CLM. Indeed, patient safety in the setting of hepatic resection for CLM mainly depends on a careful preoperative evaluation of liver volumes and a limited use of cytotoxic agents followed by a delay of at least 5 weeks before the surgery.",1
2722,15074722,Effect of coexistent scaphotrapezoidal osteoarthrosis on outcome after trapeziectomy,"Scaphotrapezoidal osteoarthrosis can cause persistent pain after trapeziectomy. It has previously been recommended that the scaphotrapezoidal joint should be resected at the time of trapeziectomy to avoid this complication if radiographs show evidence of joint degeneration. We have reviewed the records of 77 patients who had 87 trapeziectomies and assessed their radiographs for the presence and degree of osteoarthrosis. There was evidence of scaphotrapezoidal osteoarthrosis in almost half of the hands. Its presence, however, had no influence on subjective or objective measures of pain, function or power before or after operation, or on outcome. Only one patient required resection of the scaphotrapezoidal joint because of persistent pain. Resection of the joint cannot be recommended as a routine adjunct to trapeziectomy on radiological evidence alone. ",0
2723,4733,Huntington's chorea. Changes in neurotransmitter receptors in the brain,"Neurotransmitter-receptor binding sites for apparent muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors were measured in the caudate nucleus and frontal cerebral cortex from post-mortem brains of 16 patients with Huntington's chorea and 16 controls. In addition, the samples were assayed for the gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and for the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. In the caudate nucleus of choreic brain, both enzyme activities were markedly lower, with significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic and serotonin receptor binding, whereas enzyme activities and receptor binding were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were not significantly different in choreic and control caudate nucleus or cortex, suggesting that, despite the loss of gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing ability in the corpus striatum, gamma-aminobuytric acid mimetic drugs might alleviate the movement disorders in Huntington's chorea.",0
2724,1531218,First analysis of tumor regression for the European randomized trial of etanidazole combined with radiotherapy in head and neck carcinomas,"From July 1987 to July 1990, 374 patients were randomized in a multicenter trial coordinated by the Gustave-Roussy Institute. Patients were treated either by radiotherapy alone (RT) or by combined etanidazole with radiotherapy (ETA). The same radiotherapy protocol was used in both arms. Major deviations from the protocol occurred in 16% of the patients. Etanidazole was given at a dose of 2 g/m2, 3 times per week, for a total of 30-34 g/m2. Seventeen percent of the patients received less than 14 injections (4% refused, 12% presented a toxicity, 1% died before beginning). The rate of neuropathy was 28% in the ETA arm and 3% in the RT arm. Acute radiotherapy reactions occurred in similar proportions in both arms. The 3-month rates of complete regression are presently 75.3% in the RT alone group and 77.6% in the ETA group; this difference is not significant. No definitive results are presently available and we must wait for the two-year survival results. In addition, if a meta-analysis could be performed with the parallel RTOG study, the results would be more valid. ",0

2726,10389174,Age-dependent changes in memory and mushroom bodies in the Drosophila mutant vermilion deficient in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism,"Evolutionary conservation of homologous genes that cause related phenotypes in humans and Drosophila help to unravel genes implicated in polygenic human diseases. Among them are neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington, Parkinson, Alzheimer and HIV-induced diseases. They are characterized by a late onset disturbances of memory, changes in volumetric indices of the brain structures involved in memory formation, synaptic and glial pathology, and altered content of the intermediates of the kynurenine pathway, the endogenous modulators of the NMDA receptors. This pathway in conserved in insects, rodents and humans. We, therefore, studied the effects of aberrant tryptophan metabolism on memory, brain plasticity, synaptic and glial immunoreactivity in the Drosophila mutants vermilion (no kynurenines) and cinnabar (excess of neuroprotective kynurenic acid) over the life time. The mutant vermilion demonstrated gradual decline of 3-th memory performance and complete memory failure on the 28th day of life in a paradigm of conditioned courtship suppression. A drastic increase in the volume of the calyces of the mushroom bodies, and a decay in immunochemical staining of this brain structure with antibodies to synaptic protein csp and glia, precede the age-dependent memory defect and develop from the 12th day of adult life.

Healthy male SD rats were divided into 2 groups (3 and 18 month-old respectively), 3 rats each group. Brainstem specimens were treated followed the brainstem's common paraffin embedding, sectioning and HE staining procedures (sections were 6 μm in thickness). The sections were also determined by Caspase-3 immunostaining and TUNEL. The Caspase-3 positive cells on the rat stereotaxic atlas were drew, then composed the sections into a 3D model. Compared to 3 month-old rats, there were more Caspase-3 positive neurons in the brainstem and the positive neurons were distributed more extensively in 18 month-old rats spectially in nucleus of solitary tract and pontine reticular nuclei. More neurons suffer apoptotic changes in the brainstem while aging. ",0
2728,8419814,Rapid serologic testing with immune-complex-dissociated HIV p24 antigen for early detection of HIV infection in neonates. Southern California Pediatric AIDS Consortium,"BACKGROUND: Serologic detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in neonates is complicated by the presence of immune complexes, consisting of passively transferred maternal antibodies and HIV antigens. A new, rapid assay has been designed to disrupt these immune complexes in order to permit the detection of a specific HIV antigen. We evaluated the efficacy of this assay in detecting HIV infection in neonates. METHODS: We measured p24 antigen in blood samples from both infected and uninfected children of HIV-infected mothers. The samples were treated with glycine hydrochloride to dissociate the immune complexes, followed by neutralization with TRIS-hydrochloric acid. A commercial HIV p24 antigen assay was then used, with an optical density greater than 0.120 at a wavelength of 450 nm defined as indicating a positive result. RESULTS: Of eight cord-blood samples from neonates with proved HIV infection, five were positive for immune-complex-dissociated p24 antigen. For two other neonates the first postnatal sample, obtained on days 12 and 18, was positive. There was no follow-up sample for the eighth neonate. Of 22 uninfected neonates, 20 were negative on the cord-blood assay. Two neonates had positive cord-blood samples, but the first postnatal sample was negative. Thus, the tests with early postnatal samples identified the HIV-infection status correctly for all 29 children who could be evaluated. In a separate group of 78 children (median age, 188 weeks), the specificity of the test was 100 percent and the sensitivity 81 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The immune-complex-dissociated HIV p24 antigen assay is a rapid, simple serologic test that may be of value in diagnosing HIV infection in neonates born to HIV-infected women.",0

We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether 52 weeks of cysteamine bitartrate delayed release (CBDR) reduces the severity of liver disease in children with NAFLD. METHODS: We performed a double-masked trial of 169 children with NAFLD activity scores of 4 or higher at 10�centers. From June 2012 to January 2014, the patients were assigned randomly to receive CBDR or placebo twice daily (300 mg for patients weighing ?65 kg, 375 mg for patients weighing >65 to 80 kg, and 450 mg for patients weighing >80 kg) for 52�weeks. The primary outcome from the intention-to-treat analysis was improvement in liver histology over 52 weeks, defined as a decrease in the NAFLD activity score of 2 points or more without worsening fibrosis; patients without biopsy specimens from week 52 (17 in the CBDR group and 6 in the placebo group) were considered nonresponders. We calculated the relative risks (RR) of improvement using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome (28% of children in the CBDR group vs 22% in the placebo group; RR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-2.1; P�= .34). However, children receiving CBDR had significant changes in�prespecified secondary outcomes: reduced mean levels of�alanine aminotransferase (reduction, 53 ? 88 U/L vs 8 ? 77 U/L in the placebo group; P�= .02) and aspartate aminotransferase (reduction, 31 ? 52 vs 4 ? 36 U/L in the placebo group; P�= .008), and a larger proportion had reduced lobular inflammation (36% in the CBDR group vs 21% in the placebo group; RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9; P�= .03). In a post hoc analysis of children weighing 65 kg or less, those taking CBDR had a 4-fold better chance of histologic improvement (observed in 50% of children in the CBDR group vs 13% in the placebo group; RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.3-12.3; P�= .005). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial, we found that 1 year of CBDR did not reduce overall histologic markers of NAFLD compared with placebo in children. Children receiving CBDR, however, had significant reductions in serum aminotransferase levels and lobular inflammation. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01529268.""",1
2731,29893408,"Crocin, a natural molecule with potentially beneficial effects against skin ageing","Oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation stand out as key features of physiological skin ageing. The aim of this study was to examine in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) grown in vitro, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of crocin, a carotenoid glycoside responsible for the colour of saffron. Moreover, considering the newly emerging field of skin glycobiology and the presence of two gentiobiosyl moieties in crocin, the effect of crocin on NHEK glycosylation pathways was for the first time investigated. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of crocin were evaluated by in vitro assays of antioxidation activities, ELISA and microarray analysis. The effect of crocin on keratinocyte glycobiology was evaluated by proprietary GLYcoDiag lectin technologies and microarray analysis. Crocin is endowed with antioxidant potential against reactive oxygen species, protects squalene against UVA-induced peroxidation and prevents the release of inflammatory mediators. The expression of NF-kB-related genes and glycosylation-related genes is modulated in the presence of crocin. Results could designate this molecule as a promising skin ageing prevention cosmetic agent. Of note, some of these effects could be mediated by protein O-glycosylation and interaction of crocin with osidic receptors of keratinocytes. ",0
2732,18072873,"Effects of bazedoxifene on BMD and bone turnover in postmenopausal women: 2-yr results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-, and active-controlled study","""Osteoporosis is an increasingly common health concern in postmenopausal women. In a 2-yr phase III study, bazedoxifene prevented bone loss, reduced bone turnover, and was well tolerated in early postmenopausal women with normal or low BMD. INTRODUCTION: Bazedoxifene is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator that has increased BMD and bone strength in experimental models, without stimulating breast or uterus. This 24-mo, randomized, double-blind study assessed the efficacy and safety of three doses of bazedoxifene compared with placebo and raloxifene in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal women with a BMD T-score at the lumbar spine or femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5 or clinical risk factors for osteoporosis were randomly assigned to one of five groups: bazedoxifene 10, 20, or 40 mg/d, placebo, or raloxifene 60 mg/d. All women received elemental calcium. Efficacy outcomes included changes from baseline through 24 mo in BMD of the lumbar spine, hip, femoral neck, and femoral trochanter and biomarkers of bone metabolism. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 1434 women (mean age, 58 yr; mean time from last menstrual period, 11 yr). All doses of bazedoxifene and raloxifene prevented bone loss, whereas in the placebo group, there was significant loss of BMD at all skeletal sites. Mean differences in percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 24 mo relative to placebo were 1.08 +/- 0.28%, 1.41 +/- 0.28%, 1.49 +/- 0.28%, and 1.49 +/- 0.28% for 10, 20, and 40 mg bazedoxifene and 60 mg raloxifene, respectively (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Comparable BMD responses were observed at other body sites. Significant and comparable decreases in serum osteocalcin and C-telopeptide levels from baseline and relative to placebo with active treatment were observed as early as 3 mo and were sustained through study conclusion (p < 0.001). Overall incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuations caused by adverse events were similar between groups. The most common adverse events included headache, infection, arthralgia, pain, hot flush, and back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with bazedoxifene prevented bone loss and reduced bone turnover equally as well as raloxifene and was generally well tolerated in postmenopausal women with normal/low BMD.""",1

This Phase III study (COMMAND-4; AI444-042) evaluated the efficacy and safety of daclatasvir (DCV), a pan-genotypic HCV NS5A inhibitor, with pegylated interferon-?2a/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) in treatment-naive patients with HCV GT4 infection. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (2:1; blinded) to treatment with DCV 60 mg (n=82) or placebo (n=42) once daily plus PEG-IFN 180 ?g weekly and RBV 1,000-1,200 mg/day (weight-based) twice daily. DCV-treated patients with undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12 (eRVR) received 24 weeks of DCV plus PEG-IFN/RBV; those without eRVR received an additional 24 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV. All placebo-treated patients received 48 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV. The primary end point was sustained virological response (SVR) at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). RESULTS: Patients were 75% IL28B non-CC and 11% had cirrhosis. SVR rates (HCV RNA < lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ]) at post-treatment week 12 or later (imputed to include patients missing SVR12 assessments but had SVR after post-treatment week 12) were 82% (67/82) with DCV plus PEG-IFN/RBV versus 43% (18/42) with PEG-IFN/RBV (P<0.0001). In DCV recipients, SVR12 rates were comparable across subgroups. The safety and tolerability profile of DCV plus PEG-IFN/RBV was comparable to that of PEG-IFN/RBV. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 4.9% of patients receiving DCV plus PEG-IFN/RBV and 7.1% of patients receiving PEG-IFN/RBV. CONCLUSIONS: In treatment-naive patients with HCV GT4 infection, DCV plus PEG-IFN/RBV achieved higher SVR12 rates than PEG-IFN/RBV alone. These data support DCV-based regimens for treatment of HCV GT4 infection, including all-oral combinations with other direct-acting antivirals (AI444-042; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01448044).""",1
2739,27410922,Olanzapine for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting,"BACKGROUND: We examined the efficacy of olanzapine for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we compared olanzapine with placebo, in combination with dexamethasone, aprepitant or fosaprepitant, and a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3-receptor antagonist, in patients with no previous chemotherapy who were receiving cisplatin (?70 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin. The doses of the three concomitant drugs administered before and after chemotherapy were similar in the two groups. The two groups received either 10 mg of olanzapine orally or matching placebo daily on days 1 through 4. Nausea prevention was the primary end point; a complete response (no emesis and no use of rescue medication) was a secondary end point. RESULTS: In the analysis, we included 380 patients who could be evaluated (192 assigned to olanzapine, and 188 to placebo). The proportion of patients with no chemotherapy-induced nausea was significantly greater with olanzapine than with placebo in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy (74% vs. 45%, P=0.002), the period from 25 to 120 hours after chemotherapy (42% vs. 25%, P=0.002), and the overall 120-hour period (37% vs. 22%, P=0.002). The complete-response rate was also significantly increased with olanzapine during the three periods: 86% versus 65% (P<0.001), 67% versus 52% (P=0.007), and 64% versus 41% (P<0.001), respectively. Although there were no grade 5 toxic effects, some patients receiving olanzapine had increased sedation (severe in 5%) on day 2. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine, as compared with placebo, significantly improved nausea prevention, as well as the complete-response rate, among previously untreated patients who were receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

2740,8707252,S-adenosyl-L-methionine prevents disruption of canalicular function and pericanalicular cytoskeleton integrity caused by cyclosporin A in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets,"Isolated rat hepatocyte couplets were used to study the effect of S-adenosyl-L methionine (SAMe) treatment on disruption of canalicular function caused by cyclosporin A (CyA). Canalicular function was assessed by counting the percentage of couplets that were able to accumulate the fluorescent cholephile choly-lysyl-fluorescein (CLF) into the canalicular vacuole between the two cells, i.e., canalicular vacuole accumulation (CVA). Cotreatment with 1 mmol/L SAMe prevented the inhibition of canalicular vacuole accumulation caused by CyA (75 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L), whereas treatment with it after CyA was unsuccessful. SAMe prevented the dose dependent reduction caused by CyA (5 nmol/L-1 mumol/L) both on CVA and on retention of CLF preaccumulated within the canaliculus, the effect on retention being complete. No difference in intracellular content of reduced glutathione (GSH) between the control and any dose level of the immunosuppressor, with or without SAMe treatment was observed, suggesting that changes in intracellular reduced GSH levels are not involved in the effects of SAMe. F-actin was stained with fluorescein-isothiocyanate phalloidin and fluorescence measurements were performed by confocal microscopy. The ratio of the percanalicular area fluorescence/total couplet fluorescence, indicative of F-actin distribution, significantly decreased with CyA. However, cotreatment of CyA with SAMe protected the integrity of the pericanalicular cytoskeleton, suggesting that this beneficial effect on canalicular function may maintain canalicular contractions and/or preserve tight junction function. Results are discussed in relation to possible involvement of the transmethylation pathway, modifications in membrane fluidity, effects on bile acid transport, and of inhibition of uptake of CyA. They suggest that SAMe could be a good candidate for protecting against CyA-induced membrane dysfunction.",0
2741,7756636,The syndrome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease after marrow transplantation,"The clinical syndrome of VOD is a frequent cause of nonrelapse mortality among patients receiving high-dose cytoreductive regimens. Patients likely to develop VOD have existing liver dysfunction, evidence of infection before conditioning, tend to receive more intensive preparative regimens, and often receive marrow from alternative donors. Therapeutic drug monitoring of busulfan and pharmacokinetic dose adjustments appear to be useful in reducing the incidence of VOD in patients receiving this agent. Data are contradictory as regards whether pharmacologic prophylaxis is effective. Patients who will develop severe VOD are characterized by a rapid increase in serum bilirubin as well as weight. Supportive management of these patients should attempt to preserve respiratory as well as renal function, sometimes a very difficult task. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has promise. However, given its potential for toxicity, a prospective randomized trial should be performed. Hopefully, as more data regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this illness are elucidated, more thoughtful prevention strategies will be developed. This will be necessary, particularly as newer, more intensive preparative regimens are being developed, as access to alternative donors increases, and as more diseases will be treated with this approach.",1
2742,28955396,Systematic Review of Treatment for Trapped Thrombus in Patent Foramen Ovale,"Trapped thrombus in patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a rare complication of pulmonary embolism that may lead to tragic clinical events. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal treatment for different clinical situations in patients with trapped thrombus in a PFO by conducting a literature review. A PubMed database search was conducted from 1991 through 2015, and 194 patients (185 articles) with trapped thrombus in a PFO were identified. Patient characteristics, paradoxical embolic events, and factors affecting 60-day mortality were analyzed retrospectively. Among all patients, 112 (57.7%) were treated with surgery, 28 with thrombolysis, and 54 with anticoagulation alone. Dyspnea (79.4%), chest pain (33.0%), and syncope (17.5%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Pretreatment embolism was found in 37.6% of cases, and stroke (24.7%) was the most common event. Surgery was associated with fewer post-treatment embolic events than were other treatment options (p=0.044). In the multivariate analysis, initial shock or arrest, and thrombolysis were independent predictors of 60-day mortality. Thrombolysis was related with higher 60-day mortality compared with surgery in patients who had no initial shock or arrest. This systematic review showed that surgery was associated with a lower overall incidence of post-treatment embolic events and a lower 60-day mortality in patients with trapped thrombus in a PFO. In patients without initial shock or arrest, thrombolysis was related with a higher 60-day mortality compared with surgery. ",0
2743,16519314,"Effect of short-term exposure to methyl-tert-butyl ether and tert-butyl alcohol on the hatch rate and development of the African catfish, Clarias gariepinus","Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a synthetic chemical used as a fuel additive, has been detected more frequently in the environment than previously. In this study, we examine the effects of MTBE (up to 100 mg/L) and its primary metabolite tertbutyl alcohol (TBA) (up to 1,400 mg/L) on the hatch rate and larval development of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Exposure to higher MTBE concentrations resulted in deformed eyes, mouthparts, and spinal cord and in increased larval mortality. Methyl tert-butyl ether exposure had no significant impact on egg viability, whereas TBA induced a decline of hatch rate. The MTBE can be regarded as a pollutant with toxicological effects on catfish larvae at concentrations above 50 mg/L. Although such concentrations greatly surpass present-day concentrations found in surface water (0.088 mg/L), concentrations up to 200 mg/L have been detected in groundwater. ",0

METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, apremilast 20 mg twice a day, or apremilast 30 mg twice a day. Patients whose swollen and tender joint counts had not improved by ?20% were considered nonresponders at week 16 and were required to enter the protocol-defined early escape. At week 24, patients were transitioned in a blinded manner to receive apremilast 20 mg twice a day if they were initially randomized to receive placebo. Patients who were not initially randomized to receive placebo continued to receive their target apremilast dose. Patients were required to take a stable dose of MTX (7.5-25 mg/week) throughout the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients who were receiving MTX therapy were randomized and received ?1 dose of study medication. At week 16, similar proportions of patients receiving placebo (35%), apremilast 20 mg twice a day (28%), and apremilast 30 mg twice a day (34%) met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement in disease activity (the primary efficacy end point). In the MRI substudy, mean change from baseline in total joint damage scores according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring system was generally similar with either apremilast dose at week 16. At week 52, no trends were noted for clinical end points by treatment group. Both apremilast doses were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Apremilast efficacy was not demonstrated in patients who had active RA despite stable MTX therapy.",1
2746,25403445,Leptin induced GRP78 expression through the PI3K-mTOR pathway in neuronal cells,"Leptin is a circulating hormone that plays a critical role in regulating energy expenditure and food intake. Evidence to suggest the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the development of obesity is increasing. To adapt against ER stress, cells trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). The 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is an ER chaperone that protects cells against ER stress by inducing protein folding. In the present study, we hypothesized that leptin may activate UPR and protect against ER stress associated with obesity. SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line stably transfected with the Ob-Rb leptin receptor (SH-SY5Y-ObRb), was treated with leptin. We demonstrated that leptin induced GRP78 expression. We then validated the mechanism responsible for the leptin-induced expression of GRP78. Interestingly, leptin-induced GRP78 expression was not dependent on IRE1-XBP1 pathway. On the other hand, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibited the leptin-induced expression of GRP78. These results suggested that the leptin-induced expression of GRP78 may be dependent on the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Leptin specifically induced GRP78 because the induction of the ER-apoptotic marker, CHOP, was not detected in leptin-treated cells. Therefore, leptin may upregulate the expression of GRP78, thereby protecting against ER stress associated with obesity. ",0
2747,2030001,Involvement of cell calcium and transmembrane potential in control of hepatocyte volume,"This study examined the role of hepatocyte calcium and cytoskeleton in activation of hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and control of cell volume. Hepatocyte transmembrane potential was measured by glass microelectrodes in mouse liver slices before and after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hepatocytes were loaded with tetramethylammonium by briefly exposing liver slices to nystatin, a cation poreforming antibiotic. Changes in hepatocyte steady-state water volume were determined by changes in intracellular tetramethylammonium activity measured with tetramethylammonium-sensitive, double-barrel micro-electrodes 4 min after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hyposmotic stress of 74% of the control osmolality (approximately 280 mOsm) hyperpolarized hepatocyte transmembrane potential by 1.83 times the control hepatocyte transmembrane potential, and cell water volume increased by a factor of 1.19. The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (100 mumol/L) completely inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential. This inhibitory effect diminished at doses of 37.5 or 50 mumol/L, but even these hyperpolarizations were decreased significantly compared with control. Hyposmotic stress during added verapamil dosage (50 mumol/L) also resulted in 23% greater cell swelling compared with control. Ca(2+)-free medium plus ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (5 mmol/L) inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and resulted in 16% greater cell swelling compared with control. Calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine (100 mumol/L) and promethazine (100 mumol/L) inhibited the hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential caused by hyposmolality, as did 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl ester) (50 mumol/L), which inhibits mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Cytochalasin B (50 mumol/L), which disrupts microfilaments, also inhibited hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential with osmotic stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
2748,29892089,Introducing medical genetics services in Ethiopia using the MiGene Family History App,"Almost all low-income countries and many middle-income countries lack the capacity to deliver medical genetics services. We developed the MiGene Family History App (MFHA), which assists doctors with family history collection and population-level epidemiologic analysis. The MFHA was studied at St. Paul's Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A needs assessment was used to assess Ethiopian physicians' experience with genetics services. The MFHA then collected patient data over a 6-month period. The majority of doctors provide genetics services, with only 16% reporting their genetics knowledge is sufficient. A total of 1699 patients from the pediatric ward (n = 367), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (n = 477), and antenatal clinic (n = 855) were collected using the MFHA with a 4% incidence of a MFHA-screened condition present. The incidence was 11.7% in the pediatric ward, 3% in the NICU, and 0.5% in the antenatal clinic. Heart malformations (5.5% of patients) and trisomy 21 (4.4% of patients) were the most common conditions in the pediatric ward. Medical genetics services are needed in Ethiopia. As other countries increase their genetics capacity, the MFHA can provide fundamental genetics services and collect necessary epidemiologic data. ",0
2749,25514302,Entecavir vs lamivudine for prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation among patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy: a randomized clinical trial,"""IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a serious complication for patients with lymphoma treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapies, despite lamivudine prophylaxis treatment. An optimal prophylactic antiviral protocol has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of entecavir and lamivudine in preventing HBV reactivation in patients seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving chemotherapy treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, open-label, phase 3 study conducted from February 2008 through December 2012 at 10 medical centers in China. This study was a substudy of a parent study designed to compare a 3-week with a 2-week R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen for untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients enrolled in the parent study who were seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen and had normal liver function, serum HBV DNA levels of less than 103 copies/mL, and no prior antiviral therapy were randomized to entecavir (n?=?61) or lamivudine (n?=?60). INTERVENTIONS: Daily entecavir (0.5 mg) or lamivudine (100 mg) beginning 1 week before the initiation of R-CHOP treatment to 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was the incidence of HBV-related hepatitis. The secondary end points included rates of HBV reactivation, chemotherapy disruption due to hepatitis, and treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: There were 121 patients randomly assigned to receive entecavir (n?=?61) or lamivudine (n?=?60). The date of last patient follow-up was May 25, 2013. The rates were significantly lower for the entecavir group vs the lamivudine group for HBV-related hepatitis (0% vs 13.3%, respectively; difference between groups, 13.3% [95% CI, 4.7% to 21.9%]; P?=?.003), HBV reactivation (6.6% vs 30%; difference, 23.4% [95% CI, 10.2% to 36.6%]; P?=?.001), and chemotherapy disruption (1.6% vs 18.3%; difference, 16.7% [95% CI, 6.4% to 27.0%]; P?=?.002). Of the 61 patients in the entecavir group, 15 (24.6%) experienced treatment-related adverse events. Of 60 patients in the lamivudine group, 18 (30%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (difference between entecavir and lamivudine groups, 5.4% [95% CI, -10.5% to 21.3%]; P?=?.50). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma undergoing R-CHOP chemotherapy, the addition of entecavir compared with lamivudine resulted in a lower incidence of HBV-related hepatitis and HBV reactivation. If replicated, these findings support the use of entecavir in these patients.

2750,26014906,Review article: the efficacy and safety of daclatasvir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection,"""BACKGROUND: The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has evolved dramatically after the introduction of direct acting anti-virals. NS5A protein plays an important role in HCV replication and is an attractive target for drug development. AIM: To review clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of direct-acting anti-virals regimens containing daclastavir, an NS5A inhibitor, in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: A Medline search was undertaken to identify relevant literature using search terms including 'daclatasvir', 'HCV treatment' and 'NS5A inhibitors'. Furthermore, we scanned abstracts presented at the recent international meetings in liver disease, viral hepatitis and infectious disease, as well as the reference lists of the review articles to identify publications not retrieved by electronic searches. RESULTS: Daclatasvir is the first-in-class HCV NS5A inhibitor that has been demonstrated in Phase I-III trials to have a potent anti-viral effect and clinical efficacy across multiple HCV genotypes (GT). Daclastavir is generally safe and well tolerated, with a low barrier to resistance and low potential for drug-drug interaction. When Daclastavir is added to PEG-IFN/RBV platform, sustained virological response (SVR) rates are increased significantly compared with PEG-IFN/RBV alone. The all-oral combination of Daclastavir/asunaprevir (ASV; protease inhibitor) has high SVR rates against GT1b, but less activity against GT1a. Dual combination of Daclastavir/Sofosbuvir (SOF; nucleotide polymerase inhibitor) and triple combination of Daclastavir/ASV/beclabuvir (BCV; non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor) have demonstrated >90% SVR rates in both treatment na?ve and treatment-experienced patients with GT1. Furthermore, Daclastavir/SOF combination has also demonstrated up to 90% SVR rates in patients with GT3, and in those with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection, cirrhosis and post-transplant HCV recurrence with any GT. Daclastavir/ASV/BCV has primarily demonstrated near 100% SVR rates in patients with GT4. CONCLUSION: Daclastavir-containing regimens, with or without PEG-IFN, have shown promising results in clinical trials, and present an excellent treatment option for those with chronic HCV and for multiple genotypes.""",1

We assessed the effect of maintenance olaparib on overall survival in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer, including those with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (BRCAm). METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial involving 82 sites across 16 countries, patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer who had received two or more courses of platinum-based chemotherapy and had responded to their latest regimen were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated sequence to receive oral maintenance olaparib (as capsules; 400 mg twice a day) or a matching placebo by an interactive voice response system. Patients were stratified by ancestry, time to progression on penultimate platinum, and response to most recent platinum. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment by the use of unique identifiers generated during randomisation. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression-free survival. In this updated analysis, we present data for overall survival, a secondary endpoint, from the third data analysis after more than 5 years' follow-up (intention-to-treat population). We did the updated overall survival analysis, described in this Article at 77% data maturity, using a two-sided ? of 0?95%. As the study was not powered to assess overall survival, this analysis should be regarded as descriptive and the p values are nominal. We analysed randomly assigned patients for overall survival and all patients who received at least one dose of treatment for safety. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00753545. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 265 patients were randomly assigned to olaparib (n=136) or placebo (n=129). 136 patients had deleterious BRCAm. The data cutoff for this analysis was Sept 30, 2015. An overall survival advantage was seen with maintenance olaparib versus placebo in all patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0?73 [95% CI 0?55-0?96]; nominal p=0?025, which did not meet the required threshold for statistical significance [p<0?0095]; median overall survival was 29?8 months [95% CI 26?9-35?7] for those treated with olaparib vs 27?8 months [24?9-33?7] for those treated with placebo), and in patients with BRCAm (HR 0?62 [95% CI 0?41-0?94] nominal p=0?025; 34?9 months [95% CI 29?2-54?6] vs 30?2 months [23?1-40?7]). The overall survival data in patients with BRCA wild-type were HR 0?83 (95% CI 0?55-1?24, nominal p=0?37; 24?5 months [19?8-35?0] for those treated with olaparib vs 26?6 months [23?1-32?5] for those treated with placebo). 11 (15%) of 74 patients with BRCAm received maintenance olaparib for 5 years or more. Overall, common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib and placebo groups were fatigue (11 [8%] of 136 patients vs four [3%] of 128) and anaemia (eight [6%] vs one [1%]). 30 (22%) of 136 patients in the olaparib group and 11 (9%) of 128 patients in the placebo group reported serious adverse events. In patients treated for 2 years or more, adverse events in the olaparib and placebo groups included low-grade nausea (24 [75%] of 32 patients vs two [40%] of five), fatigue (18 [56%] of 32 vs two [40%] of five), vomiting (12 [38%] of 32 vs zero), and anaemia (eight [25%] of 32 vs one [20%] of five); generally, events were initially reported during the first 2 years of treatment. INTERPRETATION: Despite not reaching statistical significance, patients with BRCA-mutated platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer receiving olaparib maintenance monotherapy after platinum-based chemotherapy appeared to have longer overall survival, supporting the reported progression-free survival benefit. Clinically useful long-term exposure to olaparib was seen with no new safety signals. Taken together, these data support both the long-term clinical benefit and tolerability of maintenance olaparib in patients with BRCA-mutated platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer.

2753,10487399,Felbamate in epilepsy therapy: evaluating the risks,"Felbamate demonstrates a unique therapeutic profile and often results in seizure control when other agents fail. Its use has been associated with risks for aplastic anaemia and hepatic failure. A number of confounding factors makes the actual incidence rate for each adverse effect difficult to determine. However, certain risk factors are common in reported cases. In order to minimise the risk, at the present time, it is necessary to rely on the clinical profile of the patients reporting these adverse effects. The patient reporting aplastic anaemia is usually female, Caucasian, and an adult. The dose did not appear to be a factor and the time to onset of aplastic anaemia was less than 1 year for all patients. Concomitant medications and diseases may play an important role. Patients with reported aplastic anaemia generally had a history of a serious allergy or toxicity to other anticonvulsants and/or a background of having had a cytopenia due to other anticonvulsants, and a diagnosis or serological evidence of concomitant immune disorder. The demographics associated with hepatic failure are less well defined. Patients were also predominantly female, were equally divided among adult and paediatric patients, and had a broad range of time to presentation of hepatotoxicity following felbamate therapy. Concomitant medications again play an important role with, in this case, valproic acid (sodium valproate), phenytoin and carbamazepine being the most frequent. In 50% of the population, hepatic failure was not felt to be due to felbamate but associated with confounding factors including status epilepticus, paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity, hepatitis and shock liver. Initial research has failed to provide a diagnostic indicator. However, work on a potential intermediate felbamate metabolite has suggested the formation of a reactive aldehyde whose end products have been detected in the urine of felbamate treated patients. Until these data are confirmed, the medical history, clinical picture, and laboratory testing, should be used to identify patients at risk. The risks for toxicity with felbamate should be evaluated before starting treatment. In addition, liver function tests and complete blood count (CBC) prior to therapy and at clinically rational intervals should be conducted. Patients must be educated in the likely prodromal symptoms of potential marrow/liver toxicity. Felbamate is too valuable an anticonvulsant to be relegated to the therapeutic scrap heap. With monitoring, patient education, and continued research to further elucidate risk factors, felbamate can be a viable therapeutic agent for patients with epilepsy.",1

2755,12556541,Multifactorial intervention and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the Steno-2 Study, we compared the effect of a targeted, intensified, multifactorial intervention with that of conventional treatment on modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. METHODS: The primary end point of this open, parallel trial was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and amputation. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance with national guidelines and 80 to receive intensive treatment, with a stepwise implementation of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy that targeted hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria, along with secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, and the mean follow-up was 7.8 years. The decline in glycosylated hemoglobin values, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured after an overnight fast, and urinary albumin excretion rate were all significantly greater in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group. Patients receiving intensive therapy also had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.73), nephropathy (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.87), retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.86), and autonomic neuropathy (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: A target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention aimed at multiple risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria reduces the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by about 50 percent.",0

Treatment with cytochalasin B led to no significant change in the mean diameter of the fenestrae but to an increase in their number and in the porosity of the cells (percentage of the cellular surface opened by the fenestrae) which attained up to 300% of that of the controls. Scanning electron microscopic observations of Triton-extracted cells revealed that these modifications were related to an alteration of the cytoskeleton. The effect of cytochalasin B could be reversed; 3 hr after removal of the drug, the cells recovered their original aspect with sieve plates scattered over their surface. These observations demonstrate that endothelial fenestrae are inducible structures and that the cytoskeleton seems to be involved in their formation.",0

In a phase 2a, open-label study, we examined the safety and efficacy of an interferon-free, ribavirin-free regimen of direct-acting antivirals, comprising daclatasvir (an NS5A replication complex inhibitor), asunaprevir (an NS3 protease inhibitor), and BMS-791325 (a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor), in patients with chronic HCV infection. METHODS: We analyzed data from 66 treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis who were assigned randomly to groups given daclatasvir (60 mg, once daily), asunaprevir (200 mg, twice daily), and BMS-791325 (75 or 150 mg, twice daily) for 12 or 24 weeks. The primary end point was an HCV-RNA level less than 25 IU/mL at 12 weeks after treatment (sustained virologic response at 12 weeks [SVR12]). RESULTS: In 64 patients, HCV-RNA levels were less than 25 IU/mL by week 4 of treatment (including 48 of 49 patients with HCV genotype 1a infection and 45 of 46 patients with the non-CC interleukin 28B genotype). Sixty-one patients (92%) achieved SVR12, based on a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Virologic responses were similar between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.

After discontinuation of stavudine treatment, lactic acidosis improved in 4 patients after 4-60 weeks, and 1 patient died. Evaluations for other causes of lactic acidosis, including hypoxemia, malignancy, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock, were negative.""",1
2764,10534353,The impact of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus on quality of life,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on quality of life in a cohort admitted to Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital with acute hepatitis from 1971 to 1975. Sera stored from the original admission were tested for antibody to HCV. Systematic approaches were used to locate anti-HCV-positive individuals and outcomes assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) scale and a study-specific questionnaire as well as clinical review. Study subjects' SF-36 scores were compared with Australian population norms. Anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positive individuals (n = 15) aware of their serostatus rated significantly worse on 7 of 8 SF-36 scales compared with population norms. However, HCV-seropositive and RNA-positive individuals unaware of their HCV serostatus (n = 19) scored significantly worse in only 3 scales. Those aware of their serostatus did not differ sociodemographically, clinically, virologically, or serologically from those who were unaware, nor was there a link between quality of life (QOL) scores and objective measures of ill health. All subjects had injected drugs in the past. In conclusion, HCV-RNA and anti-HCV-positive individuals in our study have significantly poorer subjective health status 26 years after original infection compared with population norms. QOL measures were significantly worse for HCV-seropositive individuals aware of their serostatus compared with those unaware. We feel that the reduced QOL in the diagnosed group may be partially an effect of labeling and that the impact of the diagnostic process per se on QOL in individuals with HCV requires further evaluation.",0
2765,15065807,Capillary electrophoresis in the determination of anionic catecholamine metabolites from patients' urine,"A micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatographic method for determining anionic catecholamine metabolites from patient urine samples was established. The optimum electrolyte solution (pH 10.6) was made of tetraborate and sodium dodecyl sulphate into water. Furthermore, studies were focused to optimize solid-phase extraction clean-up steps to concentrate patient urine samples for identification of catecholamines with UV detection. The water-micelle distribution coefficients (octanol-water partition coefficient, log Pow) for the analytes were determined by conductometric titration. High plate numbers (120,000-200,000/40 cm detection window) and small diffusion coefficients (2.00-3.50 x 10(-6) cm(-2) s(-1)) resulted in high resolution and symmetry of the analyte zones. The standard deviations of the migration times and the peak heights were less than 3 and 7%, respectively. The octanol-water coefficients increased in the order of decreased pKa1 value of the analytes, why separation between structurally related vanillinic mandelic acids could be obtained. Limits of detection and quantification were around 0.05 and 0.1 microg/ml, respectively, except for dopamine. The concentrations of the catecholamine metabolites in the studied patient urines varied from 0.186 to 76.4 microg/ml. The results showed evidences of serious diseases among the patients. ",0

2767,27863453,"A new class of hepatitis B and D virus entry inhibitors, proanthocyanidin and its analogs, that directly act on the viral large surface proteins","Introduction of direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has provided a revolutionary improvement in the treatment outcome. In contrast to HCV, however, the strategy for developing new antiviral agents against hepatitis B virus (HBV), especially viral-targeting compounds, is limited because HBV requires only four viral genes for its efficient replication/infection. Here, we identify an oligomeric flavonoid, proanthocyanidin (PAC) and its analogs, which inhibit HBV entry into host cells by targeting the HBV large surface protein (LHBs). Through cell-based chemical screening, PAC was identified to inhibit HBV infection with little cytotoxic effect. PAC prevented the attachment of the preS1 region in the LHBs to its cellular receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). PAC was shown to target HBV particles and impair their infectivity, whereas it did not affect the NTCP-mediated bile acid transport activity. Chemical biological techniques demonstrated that PAC directly interacted with the region essential for receptor binding in the preS1 region in the LHBs protein. Importantly, PAC had a pan-genotypic anti-HBV activity and was also effective against a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. We further showed that PAC augmented the ability of a nucleoside analog, tenofovir, to interrupt HBV spread over time in primary human hepatocytes by cotreatment. Moreover, derivative analysis could identify small molecules that demonstrated more-potent anti-HBV activity over PAC. CONCLUSION: PAC and its analogs represent a new class of anti-HBV agents that directly target the preS1 region of the HBV large surface protein. These agents could contribute to the development of a potent, well-tolerated, and broadly active inhibitor of HBV infection. (Hepatology 2017;65:1104-1116).",0
2768,24999898,Experiencing racism in health care: the mental health impacts for Victorian Aboriginal communities,"To examine experiences of racism in health settings and their impact on mental health among Aboriginal Australians. A cross-sectional survey of experiences of racism and mental health was conducted in two metropolitan and two rural Victorian local government areas (LGAs) between 1 December 2010 and 31 October 2011. Participants included 755 Aboriginal Australians aged over 18 years who had resided in the relevant LGA for at least a year. The response rate across all LGAs was 99%. Being above or below the threshold for high or very high psychological distress on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. 221 participants reported experiences of racism in health settings in the past 12 months. The results suggested that people experiencing racism in health settings (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.28-8.86) and non-health settings (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.39-5.08) were more likely than people who did not experience racism to be above the threshold for high or very high psychological distress. Experiencing interpersonal racism in health settings is associated with increased psychological distress over and above what would be expected in other settings. This finding supports the rationale for improving cultural competency and reducing racism as a means of closing the health gap between Aboriginal and other Australians. Capitalising on this investment will require explicitly evaluating the impact of these initiatives on reducing patient experiences of racism. ",0
2769,17462781,Oral contraception and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,"""BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: We performed a meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies to examine the association between oral contraceptives (OC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Two independent researchers conducted PubMed searches followed by systematic abstraction of studies that compared OC use between patients with HCC and a group of controls. Pooling of ORs was conducted using a random effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias among studies were examined. RESULTS: Twelve case-control studies that included 739 cases and 5223 controls met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled estimate of ORs (age- and sex-matched only) from all 12 studies was 1.57 (95% CI=0.96-2.54, p=0.07) with a heterogeneity of I(2)=39.9. Exclusion of one large multi-national European study decreased the heterogeneity to I(2)=16.9 and increased the pooled OR to 1.70 (95% CI=1.12-2.59, p=0.01). Eight studies reported adjusted ORs (in addition to age and sex); the pooled estimate was 1.45 (95% CI=0.93-2.27, p=0.11) with a heterogeneity of I(2)=20.4. Only few studies identified or adjusted for other HCC risk factors. Six studies showed a significant 2- to 20-fold increase in HCC risk with longer durations of OC use; however, the reporting was too inconsistent to allow meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is inconclusive to establish a relation between oral contraceptives and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Future studies should focus on the duration, intermittency, and recency of OC use.""",1
2770,16511798,Undifferentiated tumor in the ovary of a corn snake (Elaphe guttata guttata),"A 6-year-old intact female corn snake (Elaphe guttata guttata) was presented with a 3-week history of anorexia. Coelomic radiographs revealed a 9 x 4 cm soft tissue opacity suggestive of a right ovarian enlargement. The mass (9 x 5 x 4 cm) was surgically removed, and multiple smears from tissue sections were stained with Diff-Quik. Multiple tissue samples from the mass were collected and fixed in formalin. Cytologic specimens were moderately cellular and contained light pink amorphous background material. The cells were primarily spindle-shaped with moderate to marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis. Cells sometimes were round to polygonal, and rarely were arranged in small clusters. Macrophages occasionally were observed. Histologic specimens consisted of a highly cellular mass composed of pleomorphic, spindle-shaped cells and, occasionally, round to polygonal cells arranged in irregular fascicles. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), smooth muscle actin, and skeletal muscle actin, but did not stain for vimentin or desmin. On the basis of the morphologic and immunohistochemical results, a diagnosis of ovarian undifferentiated carcinoma was made. In this report, we describe the challenges of using immunohistochemistry to diagnose this uncommon type of tumor in reptiles. ",0
2771,17975136,Amplicon mapping and expression profiling identify the Fas-associated death domain gene as a new driver in the 11q13.3 amplicon in laryngeal/pharyngeal cancer,"Amplification of the 11q13 region is a frequent event in human cancer. The highest incidence (36%) is found in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Recently, we reported that the amplicon size in 30 laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas with 11q13 amplification is determined by unique genomic structures, resulting in the amplification of a set of genes rather than a single gene. To investigate which gene(s) drive the 11q13 amplicon, we determined the smallest region of overlap with amplification and the expression levels of all genes within this amplicon. Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, we detected a region of approximately 1.7 Mb containing 13 amplified genes in more than 25 of the 29 carcinomas. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed that overexpression of 8 potential driver genes including, cyclin D1, cortactin, and Fas-associated death domain (FADD), correlated significantly with DNA amplification. FADD protein levels correlated well with DNA amplification, implicating that FADD is also a candidate driver gene in the 11q13 amplicon. Analysis of 167 laryngeal carcinomas showed that increased expression of FADD (P = 0.007) and Ser(194) phosphorylated FADD (P = 0.011) were associated with a worse disease-specific survival. FADD was recently reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation, and cancer cells expressing high levels of the Ser(194) phosphorylated isoform of FADD proved to be more sensitive to Taxol-induced cell cycle arrest. Because of the frequent amplification of the 11q13 region and concomitant overexpression of FADD in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, we hypothesize that FADD is a marker to select patients that might benefit from Taxol-based chemoradiotherapy.

2772,23624506,Histone deacetylase inhibitor AR42 regulates telomerase activity in human glioma cells via an Akt-dependent mechanism,"Epigenetic regulation via abnormal activation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is a mechanism that leads to cancer initiation and promotion. Activation of HDACs results in transcriptional upregulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and increases telomerase activity during cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. However, the effects of HDAC inhibitors on the transcription of hTERT vary in different cancer cells. Here, we studied the effects of a novel HDAC inhibitor, AR42, on telomerase activity in a PTEN-null U87MG glioma cell line. AR42 increased hTERT mRNA in U87MG glioma cells, but suppressed total telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Further analyses suggested that AR42 decreases the phosphorylation of hTERT via an Akt-dependent mechanism. Suppression of Akt phosphorylation and telomerase activity was also observed with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 further supporting the hypothesis that Akt signaling is involved in suppression of AR42-induced inhibition of telomerase activity. Finally, ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of Akt restored telomerase activity in AR42-treated cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the novel HDAC inhibitor AR42 can suppress telomerase activity by inhibiting Akt-mediated hTERT phosphorylation, indicating that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in the regulation of telomerase activity in response to this HDAC inhibitor.

2773,16499568,Clinical aspects and molecular basis of primary deficiencies of complement component C3 and its regulatory proteins factor I and factor H,"The complement system participates in both innate and acquired immune responses. Deficiencies in any of the protein components of this system are generally uncommon and require specialized services for diagnosis. Consequently, complement deficiencies are clinically underscored and may be more common than is normally estimated. As C3 is the major complement component and participates in all three pathways of activation, it is fundamental to understand all the clinical consequences observed in patients for which this protein is below normal concentration or absent in the serum. C3 deficiencies are generally associated with higher susceptibility to severe infections and in some cases with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, we review the main clinical aspects and the molecular basis of primary C3 deficiency as well as the mutations in the regulatory proteins factor I and factor H that result in secondary C3 deficiencies. We also discuss the use of animal models to study these deficiencies. ",0
2774,15082739,Childhood abuse and risk of smoking onset,"To determine the association between childhood abuse and becoming a smoker. Retrospective cohort study. Boston, Massachusetts. 722 women aged 36-45 years who completed the baseline questionnaire for the Harvard study of moods and cycles and the survey of interpersonal relationships. Women who experienced either physical or sexual abuse as a child were 40% more likely to begin smoking compared with women with no history of abuse (95% CI 1.0 to 2.0). Virtually all of this association was confined to sexual abuse (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.3) as compared with physical abuse (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.6). However, the joint effect of experiencing both physical and sexual abuse as a child led to a 3.5-fold increase in the likelihood of becoming a smoker (95% CI 1.3 to 9.4) compared with women who did not experience any childhood abuse after adjustment for religion, social class, and poverty. Women who experience childhood abuse, even in the absence of depression, are at increased risk of becoming cigarette smokers. ",0
2775,11422785,Cholangiopathy after short-term administration of piperacillin and imipenem/cilastatin,"We describe a patient who suffered from intestinal perforation after abdominal trauma. Perioperatively, he was treated with a single dose of piperacillin and 9 doses of imipenem/cilastatin over 3 days. The patient was discharged 5 days after surgery in good clinical condition and with normal liver values except for a marginal elevation of alanine aminotransferase. Two weeks after discharge, he developed fatigue, fever and pruritus, necessitating rehospitalization. He was jaundiced and had elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminases. After exclusion of an intra-abdominal fluid collection, a vascular problem, and infectious or autoimmune liver disease, a liver biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed centrizonal bilirubinostasis, a portal infiltrate rich in eosinophils and cholangitis. Lymphocyte transformation tests for piperacillin and imipenem/cilastatin were positive, suggesting an immunological mechanism for the observed hepatopathy. Cholestasis gradually decreased but was detectable for several weeks. The patient had a full clinical and biochemical recovery after 3 months. We conclude that short-term therapy with piperacillin, imipenem/cilastatin or the combination of these drugs can lead to the same type of hepatopathy as described for amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or antistaphylococcal penicillins. Liver biopsy and positive lymphocyte transformation are compatible with an immunological mechanism.",1
2776,24306282,"Stress, illness, and the social environment: depressive symptoms among first generation mandarin speaking Chinese in greater Los Angeles","This study documents the indirect effects of social and environmental variables as mediated by immigrant stress and physical health. Using data from a large dual frame sample of first generation mandarin speaking Chinese immigrants in metropolitan Los Angeles counties with the largest groups of Chinese immigrants, this study uses a path analytic approach to trace how predictors are related to depressive symptoms and to measure direct and indirect influences of variables. Although bivariate analyses suggested that many predictors were associated with depressive symptoms, multivariate path analysis revealed a more complex structure of mediated associations. In the multivariate path analysis only reports of physical health and immigrant stress were directly related to depressive symptoms (P < 0.05), while acculturation, time in the US, income, US citizenship, and distance of persons on whom one could rely were related to stress (but not to physical health status) and only to depressive symptoms as mediated by stress. Age and educational attainment were related to health status (and to stress as mediated by physical health) and to depressive symptoms as mediated by both health and stress. These variables were also unrelated directly to health status and to depressive symptoms. Associations were evaluated using statistical significance, P < 0.05. This study demonstrates the significance of stress and health as mediators of variables in the larger context of the physical environment and suggests that the mechanisms linking ecological characteristics of immigrants to depressive symptoms may be stress and physical health among immigrants.

2777,24335737,"Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment and the role of nursing","The first article is a good starting place for building an SBIRT program. It provides a good overview of the evidence and explains SBIRT as defined by SAMHSA. It should only serve as a starting point since it leaves questions unanswered. It does not clearly explain how to actually do each part of SBIRT. Other resources, such as National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s guide to clinicians or the American College of Surgeon’s guide, are recommended reading prior to implementing SBIRT. The major issue appears to be the lack of clear evidence that referral to treatment actually results in positive long-term outcomes for those with a substance use disorder. In addition, the development of an SBIRT program in an institution should utilize an interdisciplinary approach with a nurse lead program as a promising alternative to a hierarchical program that requires physician oversight.

2778,24450858,PI3K? inhibition by idelalisib in patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma,"""BACKGROUND: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase delta (PI3K?) mediates B-cell receptor signaling and microenvironmental support signals that promote the growth and survival of malignant B lymphocytes. In a phase 1 study, idelalisib, an orally active selective PI3K? inhibitor, showed antitumor activity in patients with previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. METHODS: In this single-group, open-label, phase 2 study, 125 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who had not had a response to rituximab and an alkylating agent or had had a relapse within 6 months after receipt of those therapies were administered idelalisib, 150 mg twice daily, until the disease progressed or the patient withdrew from the study. The primary end point was the overall rate of response; secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 33 to 87); patients had received a median of four prior therapies (range, 2 to 12). Subtypes of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma included follicular lymphoma (72 patients), small lymphocytic lymphoma (28), marginal-zone lymphoma (15), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without Waldenstr�m's macroglobulinemia (10). The response rate was 57% (71 of 125 patients), with 6% meeting the criteria for a complete response. The median time to a response was 1.9 months, the median duration of response was 12.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 11 months. Similar response rates were observed across all subtypes of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, though the numbers were small for some categories. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (in 27% of the patients), elevations in aminotransferase levels (in 13%), diarrhea (in 13%), and pneumonia (in 7%). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-group study, idelalisib showed antitumor activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who had received extensive prior treatment.

2781,3794303,Chronic liver disease after low daily doses of amiodarone. Report of three cases,"A few cases of alcohol-like chronic liver disease have recently been described in patients on high daily doses of amiodarone (400-600 mg) for 5-24 months. We report here 3 cases in which similar lesions were observed after low daily doses of amiodarone. Daily dosage was 200 mg in 2 cases, 400 mg then 200 mg in the third one, and duration of therapy ranged between 36 and 60 months. Symptomatology was limited to hepatomegaly and/or mild elevation of serum aminotransferases. Liver biopsy showed alcohol-like lesions with fibrosis in 2 cases and cirrhosis in 1 case. Electron microscopy disclosed hepatic phospholipidosis. These cases indicate that chronic liver disease may be observed even when amiodarone is prescribed at low daily dosage, provided that duration of treatment is long. They also suggest that rather than the daily dosage, the cumulative dose of amiodarone is a major factor in the development of hepatic injury.",1

2783,25008478,The intra-individual variability of faecal calprotectin: a prospective study in patients with active ulcerative colitis,"Leukocyte-derived proteins in faeces, especially calprotectin, are increasingly used to assess disease activity in ulcerative colitis. The objectives of the present study were to assess the importance of factors related to the stool sampling procedure. For 2 days, patients with active ulcerative colitis collected two stool samples at each bowel movement. The time of defecation, consistency and presence of blood were self-recorded in a diary. The variability in the concentrations of calprotectin during the day and between two consecutive days was assessed, as was the stability of calprotectin concentrations in samples stored at room temperature. Altogether, 18 patients collected 287 stool samples. The intraclass correlation coefficient in pairs of samples from 132 bowel movements was 0.79 (95% CI 0.48-0.90). The median individual coefficient of variation in samples collected during the same day was 52% (4-178). There was a correlation between the level of calprotectin and the time between bowel movements (r = 0.5; p = 0.013). After 3 days at room temperature the calprotectin concentrations in stool samples were unchanged, but after 7 days a significant (p < 0.01) decrease was found (mean 28%; 95% CI 0.10-0.47). The present data reveal a great variability in the concentrations of calprotectin in stool samples collected during a single day. Since the levels of calprotectin increased with longer time between the bowel movements, it seems most appropriate to analyse stool from the first bowel movement in the morning. Moreover, storage of stool samples at room temperature for more than 3 days is not advisable. ",0

In vitro studies of the patient's lymphocytes when incubated with phenytoin failed to indicate a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the drug; These findings suggest that the patient developed a clinical lymphatic proliferation at a time when she was immunologically depressed. This may result in an increased chance of a mutant malignant clone developing at a time when the immunosurveillance system is impaired and explains why a rare patient with this syndrome may develop a frank malignant lymphoma.""",1
2785,21737904,Acute pancreatitis in the course of meprobamate poisoning,"CONTEXT: We report a case of massive poisoning with meprobamate leading to acute pancreatitis. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old patient with a history of schizophrenia and multiple suicide attempts was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe poisoning with meprobamate (voluntary ingestion of 60 g). On admission, the patient was deeply comatose with low blood pressure and hypothermia. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis and high lipase and amylase serum levels. There was no eosinophilia. Abdominal computed tomography showed pancreatitis grade A. The patient was intubated and ventilated, and intravenous dopamine was infused. The patient regained consciousness and was extubated five days later. Improvement in pancreatic tests was noted several days later. The outcome was favorable. DISCUSSION: According to the Naranjo probability scale, meprobamate-induced acute pancreatitis was probable. Acute pancreatitis in meprobamate poisoning is exceptional. The pathogenesis of pancreatitis-induced meprobamate poisoning may be explained by two mechanisms: stimulation of pancreatic secretion secondary to cholinergic activation and pancreatic ductal hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The signs of severe meprobamate toxicity are numerous including cardiovascular and central nervous symptoms. Acute pancreatitis should also be added as a possible manifestation of meprobamate poisoning.",1

We report findings from a clinical trial evaluating the effects of miglustat treatment in patients with stable type 1 Gaucher disease after enzyme therapy. METHODS: Adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients stabilized during at least 3 years of previous enzyme therapy were included in this 2-year, prospective, open-label non-inferiority study. The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in liver volume. Secondary endpoints included changes in spleen volume, hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled (mean?SD age, 45.1?12.7 years; previous enzyme therapy duration 9.5?4.0 years). Median (range) exposure to miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. was 658 (3-765) days. Twenty-one patients discontinued treatment prematurely; 13 due to adverse events, principally gastrointestinal. The upper 95% confidence limit of mean percent change in liver volume from baseline to end of treatment was below the non-inferiority margin of 10% (-1.1%; 95%CI -6.0, 3.9%). Mean (95%CI) changes in spleen volume, hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were 102 (24,180) mL, -0.95 (-1.38, -0.53) g/dL and -44.1 (-57.6, -30.7) ?109/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The primary efficacy endpoint was met; overall there was no change in liver volume during 24 months of miglustat therapy. Several patients showed a gradual deterioration in some disease manifestations, suggesting that miglustat could maintain clinical stability, but not in all patients. Miglustat demonstrated a predictable profile of safety and tolerability that was consistent with that reported in previous clinical trials and experience in clinical practice.

Given those promising results, we did a phase 3 trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of alectinib and crizotinib. METHODS: J-ALEX was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that recruited ALK inhibitor-naive Japanese patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, who were chemotherapy-naive or had received one previous chemotherapy regimen, from 41 study sites in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system using a permuted-block method stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, treatment line, and disease stage to receive oral alectinib 300 mg twice daily or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review facility. The efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The study is ongoing and patient recruitment is closed. This study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (number JapicCTI-132316). FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2013, and Aug 4, 2015, 207 patients were recruited and assigned to the alectinib (n=103) or crizotinib (n=104) groups. At data cutoff for the second interim analysis, 24 patients in the alectinib group had discontinued treatment compared with 61 in the crizotinib group, mostly due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff date Dec 3, 2015), an independent data monitoring committee determined that the primary endpoint of the study had been met (hazard ratio 0?34 [99?7% CI 0?17-0?71], stratified log-rank p<0?0001) and recommended an immediate release of the data. Median progression-free survival had not yet been reached with alectinib (95% CI 20?3-not estimated) and was 10?2 months (8?2-12?0) with crizotinib. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at a greater frequency with crizotinib (54 [52%] of 104) than alectinib (27 [26%] of 103). Dose interruptions due to adverse events were also more prevalent with crizotinib (77 [74%] of 104) than with alectinib (30 [29%] of 103), and more patients receiving crizotinib (21 [20%]) than alectinib (nine [9%]) discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event. No adverse events with a fatal outcome occurred in either treatment group. INTERPRETATION: These results provide the first head-to-head comparison of alectinib and crizotinib and have the potential to change the standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. The dose of alectinib (300 mg twice daily) used in this study is lower than the approved dose in countries other than Japan; however, this limitation is being addressed in the ongoing ALEX study.

2788,17674307,Hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs is reduced after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients,"""BACKGROUND: The risk of liver toxicity during antiretroviral drug use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients increases in the presence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is unknown whether sustained HCV clearance after interferon (IFN)-based therapy might reduce this complication. METHODS: The incidence of severe elevations in liver enzyme levels during antiretroviral therapy was retrospectively analyzed in a group of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients after completion of a full course of IFN-based therapy. Hepatic events were recorded according to the achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR), and the presence of advanced liver fibrosis was assessed by transient elastometry. RESULTS: A total of 132 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were analyzed (66% men; mean age, 38 years). Overall, 33% achieved an SVR and 40% had advanced liver fibrosis after IFN therapy. A total of 49 episodes of liver toxicity occurred during a mean of 35 months of follow-up (9.7% per year) after IFN therapy. The yearly incidence of hepatic events was greater in patients who did not achieve an SVR than in those who did (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P<.001) and in patients with advanced liver fibrosis than in those without it (14.4% vs. 7.6%; P=.003). Drugs involved in hepatic events were dydeoxynucleoside analogues (namely, didanosine and stavudine; 40%) nevirapine (30%), efavirenz (11%), and protease inhibitors (PIs; 8%). In logistic regression analysis, lack of an SVR (odds ratio [OR], 6.13 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.83-37.45]; P=.003) and the use of dydeoxynucleosides (OR, 3.59 [95% CI, 1.23-10.42]; P=.02) were independent predictors of hepatotoxicity after IFN therapy. Conversely, regimens containing PIs (OR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.30]; P<.01) or efavirenz (OR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.04-0.44]; P=.001) were associated with a diminished risk of hepatic events. CONCLUSION: Sustained HCV clearance after IFN-based therapy reduces the risk of liver toxicity during antiretroviral therapy, which should further encourage the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected patients. In this population, prescription of PIs or efavirenz decreases and use of dydeoxynucleoside analogues increases the risk of hepatotoxicity.""",1
2789,26969258,Isavuconazole treatment for mucormycosis: a single-arm open-label trial and case-control analysis,"""BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis is an uncommon invasive fungal disease with high mortality and few treatment options. Isavuconazole is a triazole active in vitro and in animal models against moulds of the order Mucorales. We assessed the efficacy and safety of isavuconazole for treatment of mucormycosis and compared its efficacy with amphotericin B in a matched case-control analysis. METHODS: In a single-arm open-label trial (VITAL study), adult patients (?18 years) with invasive fungal disease caused by rare fungi, including mucormycosis, were recruited from 34 centres worldwide. Patients were given isavuconazole 200 mg (as its intravenous or oral water-soluble prodrug, isavuconazonium sulfate) three times daily for six doses, followed by 200 mg/day until invasive fungal disease resolution, failure, or for 180 days or more. The primary endpoint was independent data review committee-determined overall response-ie, complete or partial response (treatment success) or stable or progressive disease (treatment failure)-according to prespecified criteria. Mucormycosis cases treated with isavuconazole as primary treatment were matched with controls from the FungiScope Registry, recruited from 17 centres worldwide, who received primary amphotericin B-based treatment, and were analysed for day-42 all-cause mortality. VITAL is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00634049. FungiScope is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01731353. FINDINGS: Within the VITAL study, from April 22, 2008, to June 21, 2013, 37 patients with mucormycosis received isavuconazole for a median of 84 days (IQR 19-179, range 2-882). By day 42, four patients (11%) had a partial response, 16 (43%) had stable invasive fungal disease, one (3%) had invasive fungal disease progression, three (8%) had missing assessments, and 13 (35%) had died. 35 patients (95%) had adverse events (28 [76%] serious). Day-42 crude all-cause mortality in seven (33%) of 21 primary-treatment isavuconazole cases was similar to 13 (39%) of 33 amphotericin B-treated matched controls (weighted all-cause mortality: 33% vs 41%; p=0?595). INTERPRETATION: Isavuconazole showed activity against mucormycosis with efficacy similar to amphotericin B. Isavuconazole can be used for treatment of mucormycosis and is well tolerated.

2790,18080055,Delayed-release oral mesalamine 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablets) compared to 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablets) for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis: The ASCEND I trial,"""BACKGROUND: Delayed-release oral mesalamine 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day has been shown to be effective in treating mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC), but it is unknown whether an initial dose of 4.8 g/day is more effective than 2.4 g/day in patients with mildly to moderately active UC and in the subgroup with moderate disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A six-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial assessing the safety and clinical efficacy of a new dose (ASCEND I) of medication randomly assigned 301 adults with mildly to moderately active UC to delayed-release oral mesalamine 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablet [n=154]) or 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablet [n=147]). The primary efficacy end point was overall improvement (ie, treatment success), defined as complete remission or response to therapy from baseline to week 6. Primary safety end points were adverse events and laboratory evaluations. Data were also analyzed separately for the prespecified subgroup of patients with moderate UC at baseline. RESULTS: Treatment success was not statistically different between the treatment groups at week 6; 51% of the group (77 of 150) who received delayed-release oral mesalamine 2.4 g/day and 56% of the group (76 of 136) who received 4.8 g/day reached the efficacy end point (P=0.441). Among the moderate disease subgroup, however, the higher initial dose was more effective; 57% of patients (53 of 93) given delayed-release oral mesalamine 2.4 g/day and 72% of patients (55 of 76) given 4.8 g/day achieved treatment success (P=0.0384). Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-release oral mesalamine is an effective and well-tolerated initial therapy in patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and a 4.8 g/day dose may enhance treatment success rates in patients with moderate disease compared with mesalamine 2.4 g/day.""",1

2793,21576633,Targeted therapy with the T-cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab of chemotherapy-refractory minimal residual disease in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients results in high response rate and prolonged leukemia-free survival,"PURPOSE: Blinatumomab, a bispecific single-chain antibody targeting the CD19 antigen, is a member of a novel class of antibodies that redirect T cells for selective lysis of tumor cells. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), persistence or relapse of minimal residual disease (MRD) after chemotherapy indicates resistance to chemotherapy and results in hematologic relapse. A phase II clinical study was conducted to determine the efficacy of blinatumomab in MRD-positive B-lineage ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MRD persistence or relapse after induction and consolidation therapy were included. MRD was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for either rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes, or specific genetic aberrations. Blinatumomab was administered as a 4-week continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 15 ?g/m2/24 hours. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated, of whom 16 patients became MRD negative. One patient was not evaluable due to a grade 3 adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation. Among the 16 responders, 12 patients had been molecularly refractory to previous chemotherapy. Probability for relapse-free survival is 78% at a median follow-up of 405 days. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse event was lymphopenia, which was completely reversible like most other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Blinatumomab is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment in patients with MRD-positive B-lineage ALL after intensive chemotherapy. T cells engaged by blinatumomab seem capable of eradicating chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells that otherwise cause clinical relapse.",1
2794,19575147,Information gaps for patients requiring craniotomy for benign brain lesion: a qualitative study,"Doctor-patient communication in the setting of a life-threatening illness poses considerable challenges. This study aimed to determine the information needs of a subset of neurosurgical patients. Qualitative case study methodology was used. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with ambulatory adult patients who had undergone surgery for a benign brain tumor, arteriovenous malformation, or unruptured aneurysm. Interviews were digitally audio recorded and transcribed, and the data subjected to thematic analysis. Six overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) the amount of information patients want varies; (2) the type of information needed is not limited to information about treatment options and risks; (3) patients engage in independent information seeking for a variety of reasons; (4) patients consider compassion from their surgeon as important; (5) direct communication with the surgeon post-operatively is very important; and (6) patients' information needs are greatest post-operatively. Many patients felt that the amount and quality of information they received was not sufficient, particularly regarding post-operative recovery and long-term life issues, leading many to do their own research. The findings from this study emphasize the need for improved communication with patients so they can participate meaningfully in choices about their treatment, give a truly informed consent, and effectively participate in their own recovery.

2795,19072833,p75 Neurotrophin receptor signaling regulates hepatic myofibroblast proliferation and apoptosis in recovery from rodent liver fibrosis,"Hepatic myofibroblast apoptosis is critical to resolution of liver fibrosis. We show that human hepatic myofibroblasts co-express p75(NTR) (p75 neurotrophin receptor) and sortilin, thus facilitating differential responses to mature and pro nerve growth factor (proNGF). Although mature NGF is proapoptotic, proNGF protects human hepatic myofibroblasts from apoptosis. Moreover, in recovery from experimental liver fibrosis, the decrease in proNGF parallels loss of hepatic myofibroblasts by apoptosis. Macrophage-derived matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) cleaves proNGF in a concentration-dependent manner, and its expression in the liver coincides with falling proNGF levels. To define the dominant effect of p75(NTR)-mediated events in experimental liver fibrosis, we have used a mouse lacking the p75(NTR) ligand-binding domain but expressing the intracellular domain. We show that absence of p75(NTR) ligand-mediated signals leads to significantly retarded architectural resolution and reduced hepatic myofibroblast loss by apoptosis. Lack of the ligand-competent p75(NTR) limits hepatocyte and oval cell proliferative capacity in vivo without preventing hepatic stellate cell transdifferentiation. CONCLUSION: NGF species have a differential effect on hepatic myofibroblast survival. Our data suggest that cleavage of proNGF by MMP7 during the early phase of recovery from liver fibrosis alters the pro/mature NGF balance to facilitate hepatic myofibroblast loss. Whereas fibrosis develops in the absence of p75(NTR) signaling, the dominant effects of loss of p75(NTR) ligand-mediated events are the retardation of liver fibrosis resolution via regulation of hepatic myofibroblast proliferation and apoptosis, and the reduction of hepatocyte and oval cell proliferation.",0

2797,15901861,Asthma as a risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease,"BACKGROUND: The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease among persons with asthma is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study to examine the association between asthma and invasive pneumococcal disease. The study population included persons 2 to 49 years of age who were enrolled in Tennessee's Medicaid program (TennCare) for more than one year during the study period (1995 through 2002) and who resided in counties participating in a prospective laboratory-based program of surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease. For each subject with invasive pneumococcal disease, 10 age-matched controls without invasive pneumococcal disease were randomly selected from the same population. TennCare files were queried to identify the presence of coexisting conditions that confer a high risk of pneumococcal disease. For the purpose of our study, asthma was defined by documentation of one or more inpatient or emergency-department diagnoses of asthma, two outpatient diagnoses, or the use of asthma-related medications. High-risk asthma was defined as asthma requiring admission to a hospital or a visit to an emergency department, the use of rescue therapy or long-term use of oral corticosteroids, or the dispensing of three or more prescriptions for beta-agonists within the year before enrollment in the study. RESULTS: A total of 635 persons with invasive pneumococcal disease and 6350 controls were identified, of whom 114 (18.0 percent) and 516 (8.1 percent), respectively, had asthma. Persons with asthma had an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (adjusted odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 3.1) as compared with controls. Among those without coexisting conditions, the annual incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 4.2 episodes per 10,000 persons with high-risk asthma and 2.3 episodes per 10,000 persons with low-risk asthma, as compared with 1.2 episodes per 10,000 persons without asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is an independent risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease. The risk among persons with asthma was at least double that among controls.",0
2798,16855265,Trends in prevalence and outcome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may be changing as a result of changes in population demographics and in the prevalence and treatment of risk factors for heart failure. Changes in the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may contribute to changes in the natural history of heart failure. We performed a study to define secular trends in the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction among patients at a single institution over a 15-year period. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure at Mayo Clinic Hospitals in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1987 through 2001. We classified patients as having either preserved or reduced ejection fraction. The patients were also classified as community patients (Olmsted County residents) or referral patients. Secular trends in the type of heart failure, associated cardiovascular disease, and survival were defined. RESULTS: A total of 6076 patients with heart failure were discharged over the 15-year period; data on ejection fraction were available for 4596 of these patients (76 percent). Of these, 53 percent had a reduced ejection fraction and 47 percent had a preserved ejection fraction. The proportion of patients with the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction increased over time and was significantly higher among community patients than among referral patients (55 percent vs. 45 percent). The prevalence rates of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes among patients with heart failure increased significantly over time. Survival was slightly better among patients with preserved ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 0.96; P=0.01). Survival improved over time for those with reduced ejection fraction but not for those with preserved ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction increased over a 15-year period, while the rate of death from this disorder remained unchanged. These trends underscore the importance of this growing public health problem.",0
2799,17316149,The echinocandins,"""The changing pattern in fungal infections has driven the need to expand the targets of antifungal activity. The echinocandins are the newest addition to the arsenal against fungal infections. Three echinocandins have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration: caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. These agents have a broad spectrum of activity and are similar to each other with respect to in vitro activity against Candida sp, with micafungin and anidulafungin having similar minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that are generally lower than the MIC of capsofungin. The MICs of the echinocandins are highest against Candida parapsilosis; however, whether this will affect clinical outcomes is unknown. Several case reports have identified clinical failure due to elevated MICs with caspofungin or micafungin against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and C. parapsilosis. Resistance to the echinocandin class was present in some but not all of the isolates. Empiric therapy with one of the echinocandins for candidemia or invasive candidiasis in patients with neutropenia and those without neutropenia appears to be appropriate when one factors in mortality rate, the increasing frequency of non-albicans Candida infections, and the broad spectrum, safety, and fungicidal effect of the echinocandins. After speciation of the organism, continued therapy with an echinocandin can and should be reevaluated. The echinocandins demonstrate similar in vitro and in vivo activity against Aspergillus sp, but only caspofungin is approved for treatment in patients who are intolerant of or refractory to other therapies. Voriconazole and amphotericin B have demonstrated synergy with the echinocandins. The clinical response to combination therapy has been variable; however, the mortality rate appears to be lower with combination therapy than monotherapy. Large controlled trials are needed to determine the role of combination therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Micafungin and anidulafungin generally have a lower frequency of adverse reactions compared with caspofungin. Phlebitis (3.5-25% of patients) and elevated liver enzyme levels (1-15%) occur more often with caspofungin compared with micafungin and anidulafungin (< 8%). Overall, the three echinocandins are relatively safe and effective agents for the treatment of Candida infections.""",1
2800,11045912,Long-term efficacy and safety of oral Viagra (sildenafil citrate) in men with erectile dysfunction and the effect of randomised treatment withdrawal,"""The long-term efficacy and safety of oral Viagra (sildenafil citrate), a selective phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, and the effect of withdrawing treatment were evaluated in men with erectile dysfunction (ED). In 233 men with ED of psychogenic or mixed organic/psychogenic aetiology, 16 weeks of open-label, flexible-dose sildenafil treatment (10-100 mg) was followed by eight weeks of double-blind, fixed-dose, randomised withdrawal to placebo or continued treatment with sildenafil. Sildenafil was taken as needed (not more than once daily) approximately 1 h prior to sexual activity. The main outcome measures were a global efficacy question, a sexual function questionnaire, an event log of erections, and adverse event recording. In the open-label phase, 200 of 216 patients (93%) reported improved erections with sildenafil; 28 patients (12%) discontinued treatment. In the double-blind phase, the significant improvements in the frequency and duration of erections were maintained in the sildenafil group but returned to pre-treatment values in patients on placebo (P values < 0.0001 versus placebo). The most frequent adverse events in the sildenafil group during the double-blind phase were flushing (7%), headache (6%), and dyspepsia (5%). Of the 192 patients enrolled in the 1-y extension, 90% completed the study; only two patients (1%) were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy. In men with ED of psychogenic or mixed aetiology, oral sildenafil is effective and well-tolerated both at the initiation of therapy and during long-term treatment. For most patients, sildenafil treatment must be continued for improvements in erectile function to be maintained.""",1
2801,1280245,Increase of cytokeratin D during liver regeneration: association with the nuclear matrix,"An increase of a 45 kD protein (p45) in the nuclear matrix has been observed when rat liver cells were proliferatively activated in vivo by a partial hepatectomy. The maximal levels of the association of p45 with the nuclear matrix have been detected 24 hr after hepatectomy just at the time when DNA replication is also maximal. By amino acid sequence analysis, immunoblotting and immunocytochemical methods, it has been demonstrated that p45 is identical to rat cytokeratin D. Immunogold staining of nuclear matrix-intermediate filament preparations from cultured hepatocytes indicated that p45 is associated with cytoskeletal filaments that are strongly interconnected to the lamina, whereas no intranuclear localization of the protein has been detected. With an overlay assay a specific binding of labeled p45 to two nonidentified high-molecular weight proteins and also to lamin B has been observed. Northern blot analysis revealed a biphasic pattern of expression of the messenger RNA for cytokeratin D during liver regeneration. A sharp increase in the messenger RNA levels occurred in the prereplicative phase of liver regeneration a few hours before the accumulation of the protein in the nuclear matrix fraction, and a second peak occurred 48 hr after partial hepatectomy.",0
2802,20513000,Preapoptotic cell stress response of primary hepatocytes,"Primary hepatocytes are an important in vitro model for studying metabolism in man. Caspase-9 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) are regulators of the apoptotic pathway. Here we report on the translocation of procaspase-9 and Bax from cytoplasm to nuclei as well as on dispersion of mitochondria; these processes occur after isolation of primary hepatocytes. The observed changes appear similar to those at the beginning of apoptosis; however, the isolated hepatocytes are not apoptotic for the following reasons: (1) cells have a normal morphology and function; (2) the mitochondria are energized; (3) there is no apoptosis unless it is induced by, e.g., staurosporine or nodularin. Staurosporine does not trigger apoptosis through activation of caspase-9, as its activity is detected later than that of caspase-3. We propose that the translocation of procaspase-9 and Bax into the nuclei reduces the ability to trigger apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The shifts of procaspase-9 and Bax are reversible in the absence of the apoptotic trigger; the spontaneous reversion was confirmed experimentally for procaspase-9, whereas Bax shifted from the nuclei to the cytosol and mitochondria after the initiation of apoptosis. To distinguish this process from apoptosis, we call it preapoptotic cell stress response. It shares some features with apoptosis; however, it is reversible and apoptosis has to be induced in addition to this process. CONCLUSION: Knowledge on preapoptotic cell stress response is important for assessing the quality of the cells used in cell therapies, in regenerative medicine, and of those used for modeling metabolic processes.",0

2804,11508434,Alternative messenger RNA splicing and enzyme forms of cathepsin B in human osteoarthritic cartilage and cultured chondrocytes,"In previous studies, we suggested that cathepsin B, which is present at sites of cartilage remodeling in osteoarthritis (OA), may act as an antagonist of cartilage repair, an enhancer of the action of metalloproteinases, and a mediator of cartilage neovascularization and mineralization. Alternative splicing of cathepsin B pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and/or mRNA overexpression is a plausible regulatory mechanism. In the present study, we investigated the abundance of cathepsin B transcripts and the properties of cathepsin B protein in normal and OA cartilage, osteophytes, and cultured chondrocytes. Cathepsin B mRNA splice variants containing the full-length transcript (CB) and the variants lacking either exon 2 (CB[-2]) or lacking exons 2 and 3 (CB[-2,3]) were measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot assays and were localized by in situ RT-PCR. Cathepsin B protein was analyzed by electrophoretic, Western blot, and chromatographic methods. The relative content of CB, CB(-2), and CB(-2,3) varied considerably in OA cartilage and osteophytes, with less variation in normal cartilage. The mean cathepsin B mRNA level was significantly higher in OA cartilage and osteophytes than in normal cartilage. Normal cultured chondrocytes attained cathepsin B mRNA levels similar to those in OA cartilage. Enzyme overexpression resulted in the secretion of procathepsin B, followed by activation to the proteolytically active form. The high levels of CB and CB(-2) are consistent with an overproduction of secreted procathepsin B in OA. Up-regulation of chondrocyte cathepsin B, which takes place at both the transcriptional and the translational level, suggests a leading role of the enzyme in the progression of OA. ",0
2805,2541336,Human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer in Latin America,"To evaluate a possible association between infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, we performed a multicenter case-control study in Latin America of 759 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 1467 randomly selected age-matched controls. Demographic, sexual, behavioral, and other clinical data were obtained by interview, and HPV DNA was assayed in cervical-swab specimens with use of filter in situ hybridization. Cervical infection with HPV 16 or 18 or both was strongly associated with cervical cancer. HPV DNA was detected in 62 percent of the cases but only 32 percent of the controls, and the relative risk of cancer increased from 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 2.8) to 9.1 (6.1 to 13.6) with hybridization reactions of increasing strength. Although the number of sexual partners, age at first intercourse, number of live births, and Pap-smear history were also significant risk factors, the strong associations between infection with HPV 16 or 18 or both and cervical cancer persisted after we adjusted for these variables. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that genital infection with HPV 16 or 18 may have a role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Other well-known risk factors were also identified in the study, but they did not affect the association between HPV and cervical cancer.",0
2806,2911322,"Abnormalities in parathyroid hormone secretion and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 formation in women with osteoporosis","We investigated the parathyroid hormone-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) axis in osteoporosis by administering phosphate to 8 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (49 to 78 years old) and to 10 normal women matched for age (50 to 74 years). All subjects responded with a similar increase in the serum phosphorus concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.15 +/- 0.06 to 1.79 +/- 0.09 mmol per liter; controls, 1.14 +/- 0.05 to 1.73 +/- 0.08 mmol per liter) and a fall in the ionized calcium concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.12 +/- 0.03 to 1.06 +/- 0.03 mmol per liter; controls, 1.17 +/- 0.01 to 1.11 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter). Parathyroid hormone levels rose 2.5-fold in the control group (15.4 +/- 2.2 to 37.9 +/- 6.1 pg per milliliter) but increased by only 43 percent in the group with osteoporosis (14.8 +/- 2.8 to 21.2 +/- 4.1 pg per milliliter), an increase similar to that previously reported in young normal subjects (53 percent). In healthy older and younger subjects, the levels of 1,25(OH)2D did not change; in the subjects with osteoporosis, however, they decreased significantly (50 percent). We conclude that older women require a greater parathyroid hormone stimulus than younger women to maintain vitamin D homeostasis, because of an age-related decline in the formation of 1,25(OH)2D in response to parathyroid hormone, and that in osteoporosis the age-appropriate parathyroid hormone response to the same hypocalcemic signal is diminished. Our results are consistent with the presence of an abnormality in parathyroid hormone secretory function in osteoporosis in addition to the universal decline in 1,25(OH)2D responsiveness associated with aging.",0

However, the role of CNRIP1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains poorly defined. In our study, we showed that CNRIP1 was down-regulated in ICC tissues and low expression of CNRIP1 was significantly associated with poor prognosis of ICC patients in 3-year overall survival (OS) and tumor-free survival (TFS). Investigating the genomic DNA methylation profile, we disclosed a novel CpG island site named CNRIP1 MS-2 (CNRIP1 methylation site-2) contributing to the down-regulation of CNRIP1. In addition, the methylation level of CNRIP1 MS-2 was correlated to the pathological grade, metastasis, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification in ICC. Notably, we observed that CNRIP1 suppressed tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by inhibiting the activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). The sustained overexpression of CNRIP1 suppressed the in vivo tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. It was also found that CNRIP1 overexpression activated Parkin (a novel E3 ubiquitin [Ub] ligase), which resulted in the protein degradation of PKM2 in ICC cells. Conclusion: We identified that CNRIP1 acted as a putative tumor suppressor in ICC, which suggested that CNRIP1 could be a candidate biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence in ICC patients. Furthermore, these findings highlight a potential therapeutic approach in targeting the CNRIP1/Parkin/PKM2 pathway for the treatment of ICC.",0

During follow-up for up to 26 years, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower incidence of psoriasis compared with usual care (number of events = 174; hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.89; P = 0.008). Both smoking and a longer duration of obesity were independently associated with a higher risk for psoriasis. No significant difference was detected among the three surgical procedures in terms of lowering the risk of developing psoriasis. The association between bariatric surgery and psoriasis incidence was not influenced by baseline confounders. No significant difference in the risk of developing PsA (number of events = 46) was detected when comparing the surgery and the control groups. This study shows that bariatric surgery is associated with a lower risk of developing psoriasis compared with usual care. ",0
2810,797593,"A double-blind study comparing Daktacort, miconazole and hydrocortisone in inflammatory skin infections","In a 4-week double-blind trial, Daktacort cream was compared with each of its constituents (i.e. miconazole 2% and hydrocortisone 1%) in a total of 63 patients (aged 12-60 years) with inflamed skin infections of bacterial or mycotic origin. Daktacort treatment induced a significant improvement of all symptoms within 1 week and was superior to both miconazole and hydrocortisone in suppressing the inflammation. This tendency persisted throughout the trial but at the end miconazole treatment proved also superior to hydrocortisone.",1

2812,29514032,A Gain-of-Function Mutation in EPO in Familial Erythrocytosis,"Familial erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin levels is frequently caused by mutations in genes that regulate oxygen-dependent transcription of the gene encoding erythropoietin ( EPO). We identified a mutation in EPO that cosegregated with disease with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.3 in a family with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis. This mutation, a single-nucleotide deletion (c.32delG), introduces a frameshift in exon 2 that interrupts translation of the main EPO messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript but initiates excess production of erythropoietin from what is normally a noncoding EPO mRNA transcribed from an alternative promoter located in intron 1.

2813,15072149,Ultrasonography of the medial iliac lymph nodes in the dog,"Sixty-one medial iliac lymph nodes of 38 different dogs (eight with adenocarcinoma of the apocrine glands of the anal sac, 13 with multicentric lymphoma, six with multicentric lymphoma but in clinical remission, and 11 control dogs) were evaluated to assess the ability of ultrasound to identify and interrogate these lymph nodes across the different groups and to differentiate these groups using different sonographic parameters. Ultrasound proved to be useful to assess canine medial iliac lymph nodes. An increase in size or number of detected lymph nodes or finding rounder or heterogeneous lymph nodes could differentiate lymph nodes of dogs of the control group from lymph nodes of dogs with lymphoma or an adenocarcinoma of the apocrine glands of the anal sac. Subcategories of malignancy could not be differentiated. More studies need to be performed, both with patients with reactive lymph nodes and also focusing on other canine superficial lymph nodes, before generalizing the results of this study to other areas or diseases.

2814,21849817,Creating drought- and salt-tolerant cotton by overexpressing a vacuolar pyrophosphatase gene,"Increased expression of an Arabidopsis vacuolar pyrophosphatase gene, AVP1, leads to increased drought and salt tolerance in transgenic plants, which has been demonstrated in laboratory and field conditions. The molecular mechanism of AVP1-mediated drought resistance is likely due to increased proton pump activity of the vacuolar pyrophosphatase, which generates a higher proton electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane, leading to lower water potential in the plant vacuole and higher secondary transporter activities that prevent ion accumulation to toxic levels in the cytoplasm. Additionally, overexpression of AVP1 appears to stimulate auxin polar transport, which in turn stimulates root development. The larger root system allows AVP1-overexpressing plants to absorb water more efficiently under drought and saline conditions, resulting in stress tolerance and increased yields. Multi-year field-trial data indicate that overexpression of AVP1 in cotton leads to at least 20% more fiber yield than wild-type control plants in dry-land conditions, which highlights the potential use of AVP1 in improving drought tolerance in crops in arid and semiarid areas of the world.  ",0
2815,11955027,Severe hepatotoxicity associated with the dietary supplement LipoKinetix,"BACKGROUND: LipoKinetix (Syntrax, Cape Girardeau, Missouri) is a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To describe a possible causal association between LipoKinetix and hepatotoxicity. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Outpatient clinic, tertiary care hospital, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration databases. INTERVENTION: Routine medical and supportive care. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory evaluation. RESULTS: All patients developed acute hepatotoxicity within 3 months of starting LipoKinetix. At presentation, symptoms and results of laboratory tests were characteristic of acute hepatitis. All patients recovered spontaneously after LipoKinetix use was discontinued. Three of the seven patients, including one who developed fulminant hepatic failure complicated by cerebral edema, were taking LipoKinetix alone at the time of presentation. Of the four patients who were taking multiple supplements, two resumed taking supplements other than LipoKinetix without incident. CONCLUSIONS: The use of LipoKinetix may be associated with hepatotoxicity. Despite extensive evaluations, no other cause for hepatotoxicity could be identified in the seven patients studied.",1
2816,29185441,Intracellular localization of nanoparticle dimers by chirality reversal,"The intra- and extracellular positioning of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) can dramatically alter their curative/diagnostic abilities and medical outcomes. However, the inability of common spectroscopic identifiers to register the events of transmembrane transport denies their intracellular vs. extracellular localization even for cell cultures. Here we show that the chiroptical activity of DNA-bridged NP dimers allows one to follow the process of internalization of the particles by the mammalian cells and to distinguish their extra- vs intra-cellular localizations by real-time spectroscopy in ensemble. Circular dichroism peaks in the visible range change from negative to positive during transmembrane transport. The chirality reversal is associated with a spontaneous twisting motion around the DNA bridge caused by the large change in electrostatic repulsion between NPs when the dimers move from interstitial fluid to cytosol. This finding opens the door for spectroscopic targeting of plasmonic nanodrugs and quantitative assessment of nanoscale interactions. The efficacy of dichroic targeting of chiral nanostructures for biomedical applications is exemplified here as photodynamic therapy of malignancies. The efficacy of cervical cancer cell elimination was drastically increased when circular polarization of incident photons matched to the preferential absorption of dimers localized inside the cancer cells, which is associated with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and their preferential intracellular localization.

2817,20572041,Activity and tolerability of nilotinib: a retrospective multicenter analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia patients who are imatinib resistant or intolerant,"""BACKGROUND: Nilotinib is active in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia patients and was recently approved for these indications. METHODS: Data on the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment were collected from 2 phase 2 expanded access clinical trials with similar designs (CAMN107AIL01 and ENACT). RESULTS: Of 88 study patients (58 chronic, 11 accelerated, 19 blast crisis), the best responses to nilotinib were complete hematologic response (CHR) in 27%, partial cytogenetic response in 12%, complete cytogenetic response in 14%, and major molecular response in 19%. Patients achieving at least a CHR during imatinib therapy were more likely to respond to nilotinib, and failure to achieve at least a CHR on imatinib therapy was predictive of progression or lack of response to nilotinib (P=.0021). Responses were not statistically different in subgroup analysis, including that of imatinib intolerance compared with imatinib resistance, presence of ABL kinase domain mutations compared with absence of mutations, and previous treatment with another second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor compared no prior treatment. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 83% and 48% for the entire cohort, 93% and 66% in chronic phase, and 64% and 19% in advanced phase. Adverse hematological events included thrombocytopenia (all events, 27%; grade 3-4, 13%) and leukopenia (all events, 18%; grade 3-4, 10%). The majority of the nonhematological events were mild, the most common being rash, infection, bone pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib treatment is an efficient and safe therapy for imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients. Prior response to imatinib therapy is a predictor for the response to nilotinib.""",1
2818,25006899,Forensic age estimation by spheno-occipital synchondrosis fusion degree: computed tomography analysis,"The analysis of ossification points plays a considerable role in forensic age estimation. Although traditional methods are still in use, researchers are working on different age estimation procedures especially within the development of radiologic methods. One of these methods is to define spheno-occipital synchondrosis fusion degree. Spheno-occipital synchondrosis, an important growth point on cranial base, provides noteworthy information about age estimation through its late stage ossification nature. This study aimed to investigate spheno-occipital synchondrosis fusion degree for age estimation in the Turkish population. In our study, 1-mm-sectioned computed tomography images of 638 (399 men and 139 women) subjects within the age of 10 to 25 years were retrospectively examined. It is stated in our study that spheno-occipital syncondrosis fusion begins superiorly and progresses inferiorly until it is completed. Spheno-occipital syncondrosis is known to be totally open at the mean (SD) age of 11.5 (1.5) years in men and 10.7 (0.8) years in women. In addition, fusion degree is known to be increased with age. Fusion starts approximately 2 years earlier in women than in men, and the process of fusion completes at the age of 17 years in both sexes. An analysis of fusion degree between sex groups showed significance at the age of 11 to 15 years, and Spearman rank correlations indicate a significant positive relationship between age and degree of spheno-occipital fusion (P < 0.001; men, ρ = 0.714; women, ρ = 0.698). Consequently, 5-staged analysis of spheno-occipital synchondrosis fusion degree in use with 1-mm computed tomography images will be helpful for age estimation between 11 and 17 years.  ",0

2821,24314631,Role of the cytosolic tails of Rift Valley fever virus envelope glycoproteins in viral morphogenesis,"The correct folding, heterodimerization and trafficking of Gn/Gc envelope glycoproteins of Rift Valley fever virus, RVFV (Bunyaviridae and Phlebovirus genus) are essential for Golgi assembly and budding of viral particles. The Gn and Gc carboxy-terminus contain a Golgi targeting and an ER-retrieval signal, respectively. We generated RVFV-like particles with mutations in the cytosolic tails of Gn or Gc and identified regions important for release of infectious particles. The role of specific amino-acids in these regions was further investigated by creating recombinant mutant viruses by reverse-genetics. Residues outside the suspected Golgi targeting motif, i.e. the di-lysine K29-K30 motif and the N43, R44 and I46 residues of the Gn cytosolic domain, appeared important for Golgi localization and RNP packaging. Concerning the Gc tail, replacement of K2 or K3 in the di-lysine motif, had a drastic impact on Gn trafficking and induced an important organelle redistribution and cell remodeling, greatly affecting particle formation and release.

2822,28745986,Ventilation in Extremely Preterm Infants and Respiratory Function at 8 Years,"BACKGROUND: Assisted ventilation for extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks of gestation) has become less invasive, but it is unclear whether such developments in care are associated with improvements in short-term or long-term lung function. We compared changes over time in the use of assisted ventilation and oxygen therapy during the newborn period and in lung function at 8 years of age in children whose birth was extremely premature. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal follow-up of all survivors of extremely preterm birth who were born in Victoria, Australia, in three periods - the years 1991 and 1992 (225 infants), 1997 (151 infants), and 2005 (170 infants). Perinatal data were collected prospectively, including data on the duration and type of assisted ventilation provided, the duration of oxygen therapy, and oxygen requirements at 36 weeks of age. Expiratory airflow was measured at 8 years of age, and values were converted to z scores for age, height, ethnic group, and sex. RESULTS: The duration of assisted ventilation rose substantially over time, with a large increase in the duration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Despite the increase in the use of less invasive ventilation over time, the duration of oxygen therapy and the rate of oxygen dependence at 36 weeks rose, and airflows at 8 years of age were worse in 2005 than in earlier periods. For instance, for 2005 versus 1991-1992, the mean difference in the z scores for the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity was -0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.07 to -0.44; P<0.001), and for 2005 versus 1997 the mean difference was -0.53 (95% CI, -0.86 to -0.19; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial increases in the use of less invasive ventilation after birth, there was no significant decline in oxygen dependence at 36 weeks and no significant improvement in lung function in childhood over time.

2823,18323716,"Evaluation of a waterless, scrubless chlorhexidine gluconate/ethanol surgical scrub and povidone-iodine for antimicrobial efficacy]","The purpose of this study was to compare 1% chlorhexidine-gluconate/61% ethanol (CHG/Ethanol) emollient and 7.5% povidone-iodine (PVI) scrub for antimicrobial,residual effect, and skin condition. CHG/Ethanol emollient hand hygiene was performed waterless, and brushless by operating doctors and nurses (N=20). PVI hand washing was performed with water and a brush (N=20) for 5 min. The subjects were asked to press their left hand in hand-shaped agar before a surgical scrub, immediately after a surgical scrub and after the operation. The amount of isolated microorganisms were calculated by counting the number of divided areas(1 x 1 cm, 160 cell) which were culture positive in the hand culture plate. The skin condition was evaluated. The antimicrobial count of CHG/Ethanol emollient and PVI immediately post surgical scrub was 0.0 vs. 4.1 (p>.05), and after the operation was 0.1 vs. 37.8 (p>.05)respectively. The Residual effect of CHG/Ethanol emollient immediately post surgical scrub and after the operation were 0.0 vs. 0.1 (p>.05), and PVI were 4.1 vs. 37.8 (p>.05)respectively. The skin condition and satisfaction of CHG/Ethanol emollient was higher than PVI (p<.05). The antimicrobial effect between CHG/Ethanol emollient and PVI were the same. Considering skin condition, satisfaction and allergic reaction CHG/Ethanol emollient for surgical scrub is recommended in Korea. ",0

2825,17042673,An assessment of statin safety,"Recently, statin safety and potential drug interactions have received close attention in the consumer and medical press. In particular, rosuvastatin, the most recent statin introduced into the US market, has been the object of much speculation. Many of these reports have lost sight of the proven efficacy of statins in coronary disease prevention at a time when coronary heart disease is the number one killer of adults, and have failed to frame the potential drug toxicity in the context of this benefit. Summarized here are the conclusions of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Assessment Task Force, which reviewed extensive new drug application (NDA) and postmarketing data for all the currently marketed statins regarding their effect on the liver, muscle, renal, and neurologic systems. The task force found that, overall, hepatic, renal, or neurologic function does not appear to be compromised by statin use. They do not recommend routine monitoring of these systems but do recommend ongoing surveillance of symptomatic patients. With respect to muscle toxicity, the task force's Muscle Expert Panel concluded that the incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is low and appears to be dose-related, rather than associated with the degree of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering and also appears to be related to the individual statin used. For example, from the rosuvastatin NDA database and additional postmarketing data, the overall incidence of myopathy was found to be lower than that observed with other statins. Administrative claims data of hospitalization rates for adverse events in statin patients confirm the task force conclusion that, overall, statins are safe and well tolerated when used as monotherapy.",1
2826,24144196,"Levomilnacipran ER 40 mg and 80 mg in patients with major depressive disorder: a phase III, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study","""BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global health concern. This study examined the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an extended-release (ER) formulation of levomilnacipran, an antidepressant approved for the treatment of MDD in adults. METHODS: This 10-week (1-week placebo run-in period, 8-week double-blind treatment, 1-week down-taper), multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted between June 2011 and March 2012. Adult outpatients (age 18-75 yr) with MDD were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to placebo or to levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day or 80 mg/day. For primary efficacy, we analyzed the Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) change from baseline to week 8 using a mixed-effects model for repeated-measures approach on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. For secondary efficacy, we used the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and for safety, we examined adverse events and laboratory, vital sign/physical and electrocardiography findings. RESULTS: The ITT population consisted of 185 patients in the placebo group, 185 in the levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day group and 187 in the levomilnacipran ER 80 mg/day group. Study completion rates were similar among the groups (76%-83%). On MADRS change from baseline the least squares mean difference (LSMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) versus placebo was significant for levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day (-3.3 [-5.5 to -1.1], p = 0.003) and 80 mg/day (-3.1, [-5.3 to -1.0], p = 0.004). On SDS change from baseline the LSMD (and 95% CI) versus placebo was also significant for levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day (-1.8, 95% [-3.6 to 0], p = 0.046) and 80 mg/day (-2.7 [-4.5 to -0.9], p = 0.003). More patients in the levomilnacipran ER than the placebo group prematurely exited the study owing to adverse events; common adverse events (? 5% and ? double the rate of placebo) were nausea, dry mouth, increased heart rate, constipation, dizziness, hyperhidrosis, urinary hesitation and erectile dysfunction. LIMITATIONS: Limitations to our study included short treatment duration and lack of an active control arm.

2828,8177244,Risk factors for hip fracture in black women. The Northeast Hip Fracture Study Group,"BACKGROUND: Although more than 1 percent of black women 80 years of age or older have hip fractures each year, little is known about risk factors for hip fracture in these women. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study involving 144 black women admitted with a first hip fracture to 1 of 30 hospitals in New York and Philadelphia. The control were 218 black women living in the community who were matched to the case patients according to age and ZIP Code or telephone exchange and 181 hospitalized black women matched according to age and hospital. Information was obtained through personal interviews and was studied by multivariable logistic-regression analysis. RESULTS: When the case patients were compared with the control subjects from the community, the women in the lowest quintile for body-mass index had a markedly increased risk of hip fracture as compared with the women in the highest quintile (odds ratio, 13.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.2 to 43.3). Postmenopausal estrogen therapy for one year or more was protective for women under 75 years of age (odds ratio, 0.1; 95 percent confidence interval, < 0.1 to 0.5). Factors associated with an increased risk of hip fracture included a history of stroke (odds ratio, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.1), use of aids in walking (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 11.5), and consumption of seven or more alcoholic drinks per week (odds ratio, 4.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.1). The results were similar when the case patients were compared with the hospitalized control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Among black women thinness, previous stroke, use of aids in walking, and alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. Postmenopausal estrogen therapy protects against hip fracture in women under 75 years of age.",0
2829,4092653,[The so-called dihydralazine hepatitis. A contribution to the pathogenesis],"Liver injuries following application of dihydralazine in 14 patients, ten of them with the typical pattern of perivenous liver cell necrosis, are reported. The other 4 patients, all having been exposed to additional hepatotoxic substances, histologically showed mixed patterns of tissue injury in liver biopsy. Moreover, in 6 of 14 patients there were diseases in the upper abdomen and/or metabolic disorders as well as an exposition to chemical hepatotoxic substances, or an additional application of potential hepatotoxic drugs. 9 of 14 patients had been treated with propranolol and dihydralazine simultaneously. One female patient showed the typical morphologic pattern of 'dihydralazine-damage' after application of propranolol only. In 3 cases with reexposition of dihydralazine merely one of them developed the typical histological behaviour documented in the literature. Distinct fibrosis of the liver remained in 2 cases. Consequently, to the hitherto existing pathogenetic concept of dihydralazine-caused liver injury as a metabolic-toxic-allergic one, there is to be added the new aspect of summing up of the actions of various additional noxious agents.",1
2830,21851539,Long-term efficacy and tolerability of once-yearly histrelin acetate subcutaneous implant in patients with advanced prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a once-yearly histrelin implant during an open-label extension of a pivotal study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with advanced prostate cancer and a clinical response to 52 weeks of treatment with the histrelin implant. Implants were placed annually. The primary efficacy variable was achievement of serum testosterone levels of ?50 ng/dL. Secondary efficacy variables were disease progression, analgesia use, performance status and tolerability of therapy. RESULTS: Of 104 patients enrolled, over 70% received three consecutive histrelin implants, and the longest, single treatment period was greater than 4 years. Serum testosterone was consistently suppressed below 50 ng/dL in all patients and mean testosterone levels were 13.1, 14.8 and 10.8 ng/dL after 104 weeks (year 2), 156 weeks (year 3) and 208 weeks (year 4) of treatment, respectively. Most patients showed no clinical worsening of their disease, were able to continue normal daily activities, and did not require analgesic medication during the extension period. Mean (SD) time to place the histrelin implant was 4.5 (6.2) min, with only three patients having insertions that were considered difficult. Adverse events were reported in 100 (96.2%) patients. The eight deaths and 28 (26.9%) serious adverse events were judged as unrelated to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events was hot flashes in 67 (64.4%) patients. Most of these cases was judged as mild or moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The once-yearly histrelin implant maintained testosterone suppression for repeated treatment cycles and was generally well tolerated. The histrelin implant provides a clinically attractive option for long-term androgen deprivation therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer seeking fewer office visits and repeated injections.",1

2833,28195359,Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is the limiting host factor of hepatitis B virus infection in macaque and pig hepatocytes,"Infections with the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) depend on species-specific host factors like the receptor human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP). Complementation of mouse hepatocytes with hNTCP confers susceptibility to HDV but not HBV, indicating the requirement of additional HBV-specific factors. As an essential premise toward the establishment of an HBV-susceptible animal model, we investigated the role of hNTCP as a limiting factor of hepatocytes in commonly used laboratory animals. Primary hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, pigs, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques were transduced with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding hNTCP and subsequently infected with HBV. Cells were analyzed for Myrcludex B binding, taurocholate uptake, HBV covalently closed circular DNA formation, and expression of all HBV markers. Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) from the respective species was cloned and analyzed for HBV and HDV receptor activity in a permissive hepatoma cell line. Expression of hNTCP in mouse, rat, and dog hepatocytes permits HDV infection but does not allow establishment of HBV infection. Contrarily, hepatocytes from cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques, and pigs became fully susceptible to HBV upon hNTCP expression with efficiencies comparable to human hepatocytes. Analysis of cloned Ntcp from all species revealed a pronounced role of the human homologue to support HBV and HDV infection. CONCLUSION: Ntcp is the key host factor limiting HBV infection in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and in pigs. In rodents (mouse, rat) and dogs, transfer of hNTCP supports viral entry but additional host factors are required for the establishment of HBV infection. This finding paves the way for the development of macaques and pigs as immunocompetent animal models to study HBV infection in vivo, immunological responses against the virus and viral pathogenesis.

2834,28017537,Human leukocyte antigen and idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions,"A clinical association between a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele and idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs) is a strong indication that IADRs are mediated by the adaptive immune system. For example, it is well-established that HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*57:01 are associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and abacavir-induced hypersensitivity/flucloxacillin-induced liver injury, respectively. Drug-specific T-cells whose response is restricted by specific HLA risk alleles have been detected from IADR patients, also suggesting an adaptive immune pathogenesis. T-cells from carbamazepine SJS/TEN patients are activated by direct pharmacological interaction between carbamazepine and HLA-B*15:02 expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Abacavir-specific, HLA-B*57:01-restricted T-cells are activated by APCs presenting peptides which are only displayed by the HLA molecule when abacavir is bound during peptide loading. Finally, HLA-B*57:01-restricted activation of T-cells from patients with flucloxacillin-induced liver injury is dependent on processing of drug protein adducts. Based on these observations, it is now possible to utilize blood from healthy drug-na?ve volunteers to study the priming of na?ve T-cells to drugs. Future development of these methodologies may lead to the development of assays that predict intrinsic immunogenicity of drugs and chemicals at the preclinical stage of drug development.",1
2835,24326672,Milder multiple sclerosis course in patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease,"An association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to compare the disease course of patients with both MS and IBD with that of patients with isolated MS or isolated IBD. Sixty-six MS-IBD patients were identified and were matched with 251 isolated MS and 257 isolated IBD controls. Main outcomes were scores using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in MS and extent of disease extension in IBD at last clinical evaluation. After a median 12 years of disease duration, the median EDSS and the percentages of patients reaching an EDSS of 3.0 and 4.0 were significantly lower in MS-IBD patients than in controls. MS had no impact on IBD. MS course appears to be milder in patients with concomitant IBD. ",0

The Phase II TRILOGY-1 and TRILOGY-2 studies investigated whether ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus the non-nucleotide NS5B inhibitor GS-9669 or the NS3/4A protease inhibitor vedroprevir could reduce treatment duration and/or eliminate the need for ribavirin in genotype-1 HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: In TRILOGY-1, 100 cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 250 mg or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 500 mg. In TRILOGY-2, 46 previously treated cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus vedroprevir ? ribavirin. The primary end points were the proportion of patients with sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (SVR12) and safety. RESULTS: In both studies, most patients were male (each 65%) and white (92-96%), infected with HCV genotype-1a (62-70%) and had IL28B non-CC genotypes (82-87%). In total, 37-39% of patients were Hispanic or Latino. SVR12 rates were similar across treatment arms in TRILOGY-1 (82-91%) and TRILOGY-2 (88-95%); no patient had on-treatment virological failure. Two serious adverse events (acute myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy) were reported in two patients participating in TRILOGY-1, both of whom had pre-existing cardiac conditions. Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: All ledipasvir/sofosbuvir-based regimens were well-tolerated. To shorten therapy and eliminate ribavirin, use of a more potent third agent or a third agent with a different mechanism of action may be required.""",1
2837,19460762,"Efficacy and safety of comfrey root extract ointment in the treatment of acute upper or lower back pain: results of a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, multicentre trial","""OBJECTIVE: The objective was to show the superiority of comfrey root extract ointment to placebo ointment in patients with acute upper or lower back pain. DESIGN: The study was conducted as a double-blind, multicentre, randomised clinical trial with parallel group design over a period of 5 days (SD 1). The patients (n = 120, mean age 36.9 years) were treated with verum or placebo ointment three times a day, 4 g ointment per application. The trial included four visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve (AUC) of the visual analogue scale (VAS) on active standardised movement values at visits 1 to 4. The secondary efficacy variables were back pain at rest using assessment by the patient on VAS, pressure algometry (pain-time curve; AUC over 5 days), global assessment of efficacy by the patient and the investigator, consumption of analgesic medication and functional impairment measured using the Oswestry disability index. RESULTS: There was a significant treatment difference between comfrey extract and placebo regarding the primary variable. In the course of the trial the pain intensity on active standardised movement decreased on average (median) approximately 95.2% in the verum group and 37.8% in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this clinical trial were clear-cut and consistent across all primary and secondary efficacy variables. Comfrey root extract showed a remarkably potent and clinically relevant effect in reducing acute back pain. For the first time a fast-acting effect of the ointment (1 h) was also witnessed.""",1

2839,28116908,Osimertinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer,"The T790�M mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is the most common mechanism underlying resistance to first- or second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, shows robust clinical efficacy in patients with T790�M-mutated lung cancer. Areas covered: We analyzed and reviewed clinical data for which patients who experienced acquired resistance to first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs. In addition, we briefly reviewed the potential role of osimertinib as a first-line therapy. Expert opinion: Osimertinib was recently licensed for use in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to other EGFR TKIs due to a T790�M mutation. However, unresolved issues surrounding the optimal application of osimertinib remain, specifically the development of a plasma-based mutation test to overcome the difficulty of repeat biopsy, the efficacy of osimertinib for brain or leptomeningeal metastases, the development of resistance to osimertinib, and the use of osimertinib therapy as a first-line treatment. Many ongoing studies are currently exploring these issues.",1
2840,18321291,Menopausal symptom perception and severity: results from a screening questionnaire,"Although it is widely acknowledged women experience symptoms during their transition from reproductive to postreproductive stage, there is inconsistency as to the prevalence of symptoms as well as their severity ratings. The purpose of this study was to describe symptom perception and severity in mid-life women volunteering for an intervention study for menopause symptom management. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to provide data on presenting symptoms in a sample of women negotiating the menopausal transition. A community-based sample of Caucasian women aged 43-55 years was recruited from national nursing media, local media and a variety of local community sources. A screening questionnaire was administered to determine qualification for study entry based upon symptom severity scores from the questionnaire. This report includes results from the screening questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-five women were screened to obtain 110 qualified participants with mean age of 49.3 SD 3.04 years who were 4.7 SD 7 months past their last menstrual period. Sleep difficulties, forgetfulness and irritability were perceived by the highest number of women while sleep difficulties, night sweats, irritability and forgetfulness were rated the most severe. Findings from this study expand understanding of the menopause symptom experience, because few reports include symptom severity reports. All aspects of the symptom experience are necessary to develop appropriate interventions and to evaluate them. Providing education about menopause symptoms is central to nursing practice of mid-life women. Therefore, nurses must keep abreast of current knowledge to prepare women for their transition to postreproductive phase or to reassure women who are surprised to find hot flashes are not the only symptoms encountered.
